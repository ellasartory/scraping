Regular passenger kilometres by mode of transport have been calculated on the basis of the stage mode so that the distances of means of transport used for pre- and post-transport are also measured separately. For example, in the case of a journey from home to work with successively the bicycle to the station, the train and on foot to the office, the passenger kilometres travelled by a stage mode of transport are assigned to the relevant mode of transport. Kilometres by plane are not counted. The number of trips counted is based on the main mode used in the trip.",,,Double,passenger kilometres ,2.0,Missing,Absolute
