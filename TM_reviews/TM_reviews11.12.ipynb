Firstly, who thought it would be a good idea to close the middle of the station and create a bottleneck area? Like this is probably the dumbest thing I have ever experienced in my life.  Second, I live close to it and use it virtually everyday. Before, I had no problem with it. Sure it is small but it has everything you would want in a station. But then with the new year came and so did a new policy. The automated doors are now closed on both sides. So if you do not have an OV-Chipkaart or even worse, if you do but not have money in it - now listen to this - you need to go around the station to reach the opposite site. To make matters worse the ill mannered personnel working at the station with the sole purpose of seeing if anyone is trying to skip this process to reach the other side will not allow or accompany you to the other side after you explain to them.  Third, so what is the point of having 10 people around to \"check\" on your clients instead of helping us? They are not even working because I pass by everyday and see everyone just chilling and talking. When you go talk to them politely and request to be accompanied to the other side, they treat you like they own the world and turn their heads away.  Forth, please NS or whoever takes care of this place. Make a plan, like contract an urban planner and fix this situation. Because not only it ios dumb, it affects your business. Before the issue was with the separate identical machines for Trains and the other for Metro - where I witnessed countless people loosing money on it. Then this!??!',\n",

I was looking forward to a smooth and hassle-free experience, but what I encountered was far from it. The MyWheel app prompted me to inspect the car for any damages before starting my drive, which I thought was a good practice. However, it led me to discover that the entire front right bumper was broken, leaving me shocked and disappointed.  Despite the damage, I decided to unlock the car since it still looked somewhat drivable. But when I opened the trunk, I was in for another surprise. Every inch was covered in dog hair and mud, making me wonder if the car was ever cleaned. To make matters worse, the missing broken-off bumper was in the trunk as well, which made me feel even more disgusted.  While I understand that this was not necessarily MyWheel's fault, it is unacceptable that some people are not honest and do not treat other people's property with respect. It was disappointing to see that the previous renter had not taken care of the car and left it in such a condition. This is not the kind of experience I expected from a car rental service, and I hope that MyWheel will take steps to ensure that all of their vehicles are in good condition.  I believe that it is the responsibility of the car rental service to maintain their cars in good condition, and it is unacceptable for them to rent out cars that are damaged or dirty.

I was looking forward to a smooth and hassle-free experience, but what I encountered was far from it. The MyWheel app prompted me to inspect the car for any damages before starting my drive, which I thought was a good practice. However, it led me to discover that the entire front right bumper was broken, leaving me shocked and disappointed.  Despite the damage, I decided to unlock the car since it still looked somewhat drivable. But when I opened the trunk, I was in for another surprise. Every inch was covered in dog hair and mud, making me wonder if the car was ever cleaned. To make matters worse, the missing broken-off bumper was in the trunk as well, which made me feel even more disgusted.  While I understand that this was not necessarily MyWheel's fault, it is unacceptable that some people are not honest and do not treat other people's property with respect. It was disappointing to see that the previous renter had not taken care of the car and left it in such a condition. This is not the kind of experience I expected from a car rental service, and I hope that MyWheel will take steps to ensure that all of their vehicles are in good condition.  I believe that it is the responsibility of the car rental service to maintain their cars in good condition, and it is unacceptable for them to rent out cars that are damaged or dirty. As a customer, I expect the car to be clean and in good condition, and I do not want to be responsible for someone else's mess.\",\n",

The reservation and payment per ride is cumbersome, need to push so many buttons compared to Sharenow or Fetchcar. I don’t want to do my own payment every time I want to take the car. I know you can avoid that, but then you need to pay 250euro’s deposit, which I also think is not great. Especially as so many other services don’t require this. And today the app decided to end my ride before I returned, after which I was unable to close the car. So potentially a great service, at the moment it’s not perfect.

My return trip, which started at 3 p.m. in Heerlen, was disturbed by a charging problem with the rented Renault Zoe.This forced me to interrupt my journey and I could not drive further than Nijmegen.  Eventually I only arrived in Apeldoorn at 11 p.m., considerably later than planned.Within that time I also flew to Turkey this summer !! This delay could have been prevented if the car was properly maintained and checked before it was rented to me.Despite the friendly and helpful use of Kelvin of customer service, the overall service of MyWheels was far from acceptable.  Despite the fact that there were other available cars on location, the company refused to offer me replacement transport, simply due to rigid regulations.  What makes this situation incomprehensible is that MyWheels did not act customer -oriented and showed no willingness to help a customer in need.It seems that they attach more value to rigid rules than actually supporting their customers.  Even when I parked the car behind another MyWheels car on arrival in Nijmegen, they did not want to give it because of their own policy.How frustrating is that for your customer !!Eventually I had to go home by train.This experience of unflexibility and lack of customer focus was downright terribly frustrating.

Between Friday and Sunday, the battery of the car had fallen from 48 to 8%.So someone else used the car.Was there another malfunction with charging?Calling again, again wrong.The car was rented on Saturday but had problems.On the phone it was told that there was a breakdown assistance.With such a 'violent' I wonder why they had not contacted us to arrange on something.We only came up with the day itself, by calling ourselves, it was not properly administered.The solution?Rent a car much further away.This was not an option for us, so we canceled on the phone.The lady who had recorded the phone could not mean anything to refund the money, call again on Monday.  On Sunday evening the phone continued to rise with SMSs from MyWheels. 20:24 - Is the battery less than 80%?Charge this 21:00 - The car is not well linked.Do that, prevent a fine. 21:10 - The car is not in the zone. 21:30 - The car is not well linked.Do that, prevent a fine.  Called Monday to refund the money that had already been transferred.That would be fine.The mail we received was about the car that we had rented 'Saturday'.So again incorrect information, because we had rented the car for Sunday.The same mail said that I would only get half the amount back.The amount also finished what was on the account.Mail back.Apparently the ride was not canceled.Fortunately, the remaining amount was refunded to the account after this.
