 Integrating on-demand microtransit options into existing services allows agencies to better serve communities with affordable, convenient public transit, promoting economic mobility. 
By Kellie Meilleur



Nearly 70 percent of all Americans who depend on the bus for their transportation needs make less than $50,000 per year. This, according to a report by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), validates that lower-income individuals rely more heavily on public transportation than those who are earn higher incomes. 
Across the nation, more and more transit agencies and cities are turning to on-demand microtransit service to expand and improve public transportation options for low-income residents. 
What exactly is microtransit? Simply, microtransit is dynamic routing. It takes mobile smartphone apps and puts them to use to create an efficient mode of transport that adapts with each passenger’s trip needs. At the click of a button, passengers can book a trip that will take them on the quickest route to their desired destination.  
A distinctive aspect of microtransit, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, is that it is “a privately owned and operated shared transportation system that can offer fixed routes and schedules, as well as flexible routes and on-demand scheduling. The vehicles generally include vans and buses.” 
Microtransit can be easily accessible and highly efficient anda ‘no-brainer’ for many lower income individuals who can’t afford to own a car and have therefore been greatly underserved by traditional transit networks.
When COVID-19 first hit, a majority of higher income earners began working from home and using their personal vehicles for necessary travel. On the far end of the spectrum, millions of lower-income Americans didn’t have the same luxury or opportunity. They needed to get to and from their jobs and other destinations, despite sweeping changes in how transportation options had changed and disadvantaged many since the pandemic.  
That’s where microtransit in its many forms came into play, and in a big way. 
Many transit agencies, anxious to serve their most underserved customers and plug the gap between traditional fixed-route transportation and more individual transportation options, are offering riders fast and convenient ways to book their trips.  
Microtransit has proven to be a mobility lifeline. Amid the many shutdowns we have all experienced, on-demand transit has pivoted to serve specific community needs, such as food delivery to our most vulnerable community members and transporting hospital and other frontline workers to their jobs, even in the overnight hours. In fact, APTA’s data shows that dynamic, on-demand public transit has proven to be a mobility lifeline for those in low-income areas during this crisis.
Transit industry expert, thought leader and influencer Paul Comfort recently hosted a podcast segment on his show, Comfort’s Corner, about the role of microtransit for equity and inclusion. As a thought leader in the public transportation space, Comfort sees public transportation’s role as one to improve equity and inclusion for those who need it most.First, it was for the elderly and those with mobility challenges, and now, it’s for those who are underserved.
Comfort believes that microtransit is the hottest trend to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. When the pandemic hit, transportation providers made major changes to their service based on changing ridership demand and to adhere to health and safety requirements. This included altering transit routes and changing the frequency of trips. These changes immediately impacted those who had no other means of getting from point A to point B. The silver lining is that microtransit has been the solution to the transit shortage problem. Comfort explains that “microtransit fills the transit gaps, and it ensures that no one gets left behind.”  
The great news is that the stop-gap solution that microtransit provides is here to stay. Significant data across several U.S. cities has recently been gathered suggesting that microtransit has been a vital public resource for lower-income individuals since the start of the pandemic. This information, along with insights shared by transit thought leaders like Comfort, help the transportation industry to look ahead to the long-term need for microtransit as part of the equity and inclusion solution. 
By joining the microtransit movement and integrating on-demand options into existing public transit infrastructure, transit providers across the country can better serve their communities with affordable, convenient public transportation and promote economic mobility for all.

The e-hailing industry is expected to develop at a CAGR between 15 to 28 per cent, resulting in an increased market size of $285bn by 2030
By NICHOLAS WATSONMAY
If there’s one thing everyone agrees on in the aftermath of the pandemic, it’s that mobility as we know it has irrevocably changed. The transportation industry had already been disrupted by technology before 2020, with ride-hailing apps allowing commuters to have more control over their movements.
However, the pandemic transformed that experience into one of necessity and convenience. Add in the fact that, close to 20 per cent of the global workforce was told to work from home for the foreseeable future in the early months of the pandemic – the overall impact on the transportation sector cannot be understated.
According to a report published by Arthur D. Little in 2020, the lockdown reduced overall mobility demand in the US by up to 90 per cent, with 40-70 per cent reductions persisting during the recovery period. As people attempt to preserve social distance during journeys, this has been accompanied by increased personal mobility (cycling, walking, vehicles).
Before the pandemic, urban mobility demand was expected to expand exponentially, with urbanisation continuing and global demand for passenger mobility in urbanised regions expected to double by 2050 compared to 2010. Research indicates the pandemic had little effect on this growth tendency since the city population continued to expand faster than the overall growth of the global population.
That’s where mobility on demand (MoD) and mobility as a service comes into the spotlight. MoD is a new way of travelling that combines several easily accessible means of transportation to make an individual’s journeys more efficient. MoD is entirely based on technology, enabling people to be better informed of available options and make them more productive with their time.
Private firms, public entities, startups, and mobile apps such as ride-hailing apps and car-share providers, which cut out the middlemen and use independent contractors, provide solutions that facilitate MoD today. MoD dispels the myth that the only efficient way to travel anywhere – whether locally or internationally – is to own a vehicle or pay large sums to rent. The ownership trend is quickly giving way to usership or partnership. With a growing number of environmentally concerned young people entering the workforce and a high reliance on digital assets, MoD provides them the satisfaction of reducing their carbon footprint.
The sharing economy is all about fractionalisation and digitalisation of assets or services. Every sector is undergoinga digital transformation and re-thinking business and revenue models to engage with more customers regularly. With cars, particularly in the context of car sharing, an ‘illiquid asset’, that is, one that is ordinarily only available to one person is fractionalised through digitalisation into a car that is measured and priced by minute or meter and may be driven by anyone with a license.
Additionally, with ride-hailing industries, the expense or requirement of a license is removed because the customer receives the added benefit of a driver for the customer, allowing for even more micro-mobility access. According to another report by Arthur D. Little, the e-hailing industry is expected to develop at a CAGR between 15 to 28 per cent, resulting in an increased market size of $285bn by 2030. Primary drivers of this growth will be the lower rate of car ownership among millennials and the expected progressive integration of ride-hailing into other solutions, which include car sharing and bike sharing.
In a McKinsey survey of the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and China, it was discovered that key factors related to health and hygiene changed how private and business trips were now chosen. The cost of a trip was no longer as important as staying safe from health hazards. While the world shifts from CAPEX to OPEX and from ownership to usership, the ‘Netflix’ generation in the GCC is more interested in consumption than long-term acquisition. As automobiles become fully autonomous, car sharing, and ride-hailing will merge. Car sharing providers are already developing products to prepare for this, giving them more opportunities to scale horizontally and vertically while also providing an already experienced customer with more options. This will significantly influence the GCC, where young people who want to live aspirational lives are already establishing themselves.
Before the sharing economy, people were unable to engage due to the lack of infrastructure, and the high cost of current modes of transportation. A trip from Deira to Expo 2020 used to cost a minimum of Dhs120, but now only costs Dhs40, thanks to car sharing. And yet, there is still a long way to go.
In the UAE, the car-sharing to passenger car market has a penetration rate of 0.05 per cent. This is a twelve-fold decrease from Tallinn’s (in Estonia) 0.64 per cent and Moscow’s 0.87 per cent. Nonetheless, the UAE is seen as a more digitally savvy populace with higher internet penetration than most countries. The UAE has approximately 1,000 car-sharing cars today, while Moscow has 36,000. According to research conducted by car-sharing companies, the short-term potential is roughly 8,000 vehicles, with a long-term prospect of over 30,000 vehicles over the next five years.
The potential of the mobility market is enormous. The key to growth is an ecosystem approach and technology enablement. Only a business model based on partnerships and scalability can achieve sustainable development. People were previously unable to make trips that could not be completed by walking or cycling due to a lack of a practical mobility alternative. According to European statistics, one car-sharing vehicle replaces 17 cars that would otherwise take up parking spots, waste fuel, and emit carbon.
Finally, technology can help stream-line an experience, changing the dynamics of the business model and revenue/cost streams in the process. The question to consider for newcomers to the market is whether they can generate a million dollars from a million customers or ten customers? Which route is the best option if they can do this with ease and with an excellent interface? One option has a lower risk of losing a customer, but the other has a higher revenue loss. The challenge then is to build a service or platform that can appeal to customers across the market while providing five-star services for everyone.

 On-demand transit projects that started before COVID-19 have led to robust ridership and speak to innovation that the public will need in a post-COVID world, according to experts during an event last week. 
By Skip Descant


On-demand transit projects that started before COVID-19 have led to robust ridership and speak to innovation that the public will need in a post-COVID world, according to experts during an event last week.

“From the start of the pandemic, the public transportation industry pivoted to meet a new world of never-before-seen challenges,” said Paul Skoutelas, president and CEO of the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) during a July 28 press briefing. “Innovation became survival.”
APTA organized the briefing to underscore transit innovation during the pandemic and to present a new report titled “Mobility Innovation: The Case for Federal Investment and Support.”
The case studies in the report explore how various transit systems have structured, launched and pivoted on-demand projects. In most cases, the on-demand projects aim to bring transit opportunities to areas where few options exist. These areas are often suburban locations with low-density housing. But in some instances, bigger cities seek to improve their available transportation, as with a project in St. Petersburg, Fla., where the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA) partnered with transportation network companies (TNCs) and taxis to provide late-night transportation for service workers.
In many cases, the arrangements depend on partnerships with private mobility providers. When the pandemic reshuffled all forms of normal American life, transit started serving communities in often unorthodox ways. In Los Angeles, an on-demand program launched as a first-mile, last-mile solution through a partnership with Via. The program’s initial idea was to connect riders with transit stations. During the pandemic, the program, in addition to providing rides, morphed into a food delivery service for residents in need.
“When you have a partnership based on innovation, you can adjust that partnership to fit the needs of the moment,” said Joshua Schank, chief innovation officer for L.A. Metro, at the briefing. “And then it’s not a one-time thing. There are crises all the time. Different things come in and affect what you plan on doing. Being able to adjust is a lot easier when you’re working in an innovation culture and with an innovative team in the first place.”
The program with Via is now fully integrated within the L.A. Metro system as part of the Metro Micro program, an on-demand service Metro provides with its own operators.
“That means we now have a much larger pilot program for on-demand services,” said Schank.
The food delivery service has continued.
“People still need to get to essential food. And this could potentially be a mobility option that saves us trips by reducing the number of times people are going to and from places,” he added.
Before the pandemic, a similar on-demand program kicked off in Flint, Mich., and provided 13,000 rides a month. The program is now expected to provide some 20,000 to 25,000 rides a month, said Ed Benning, general manager and CEO of Mass Transportation Authority (MTA) Flint.
“So the need is very strong,” said Benning.
Another on-demand program in the Kansas City, Kan., area uses a seven-vehicle county-owned fleet. But the project also includes a partnership with a local taxi service, which can flex into the system and pick up some of the demand to cut down on wait times.
“In my mind that’s kind of the secret sauce that makes the microtransit program in Johnson County work,” said Josh Powers, business liaison for Johnson County, Kan.
Microtransit ridership is at 150 percent of pre-COVID levels, said Powers. The service provides more than 8,000 rides a month. Month by month, this number continues to increase.
Skoutelas remarked that transit is frequently seen as an “industry that’s slow to change.” However, this viewpoint overlooks the reality that a lot of change is happening in the transit world.
“[W]e need to bring attention to that,” he said. “And we want to share it as widely as we can.”

Transportation systems traditionally favour suburban, upwardly mobile users over those from lower-income groups and neighbourhoods.Emerging technology – AI in particular – can help to address this issue.Safe, equitable transportation is within our reach, but we still have a lot of work to do.
Amidst our current reckoning with structural racism, gender bias and unequal access to education and economic opportunity, the transportation industry has a responsibility to acknowledge its own contributions to these inequities. We also have an opportunity to begin to address them – through more considered choices going forward, and, excitingly, with the help of new technology. If these solutions also enhance safety and lower risk for all road users, and if they produce fewer emissions while using our planet’s resources more efficiently, we as a society will have achieved a rare triple-win.
New transit models will democratize safe transportation moving forward. Historically, transit design – and the interstate system in particular – has catered to suburban, upwardly mobile groups, while exacerbating the socioeconomic divide and limiting access to opportunity for those most in need. A recent Harvard studydemonstrated that transportation is the single largest determinant of social mobility. Lack of access can lead to less opportunity, more dependence on (often subpar) public transportation, and longer commute times. Ideally, transit networks should open up a city to all those who live within its proximity, not create mobility and economic hurdles.
Although the link between social mobility and access to transportation is troubling, even more so is how disproportionately low-income communities experience the effects of traffic-related fatalities; for example, those walking in lower-income metropolitan areas have twice the fatality rates of those walking in other neighbourhoods. Transit design in low-income communities is often not optimized for safety to the same extent as in more affluent communities. For instance, low-income communities often lack safe sidewalks and biking infrastructure, while also suffering from higher traffic volumes and higher-speed roadways. This safety disparity costs lives and is one of the most critical problems the transportation industry needs to address: bringing safe mobility to everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status.
Have you read?
When I began exploring autonomous vehicles more than a decade ago as a graduate student at Stanford University, I was excited about the challenges involved. Robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, cars, behavioural economics, psychology and more, all combined into two deep questions: first, how can we solve this incredibly complex technical problem; and second, how can we rethink transportation in cities if people don’t have to drive their own cars?
As I learned more about the needs of people in cities, another topic surfaced, too: the extent of the discrepancy in people’s ability to get from point A to point B. In aggregate, taxi drivers (of all races) preferentially pick up white passengers. Residents of underserved communities often have to spend hours commuting on multiple bus routes or biking along streets with cars zipping by at more than 40 miles per hour. Sometimes there are no sidewalks.
These hurdles make people’s lives harder. Through this lens, developing autonomous vehicles is even more than an exciting technical, economic, safety and environmental challenge; it’s a people issue, too. How can we find ways for everyone – regardless of their socioeconomic status or where they live in a city – to safely and efficiently go where they want?

Often when confronted with massive societal-level problems like these, we turn to the government for answers or solutions. No doubt, they have a critical role to play in almost all pieces of the puzzle. But changing laws, societal norms, and decades-old programmes can take a long time at best, and sometimes there are so many stakeholders, different opinions, and inability (or unwillingness) to pay, that genuine change feels out of reach. So it’s exciting when new technologies and associated business models emerge that can play a part in solving the hardest problems.
AI comes with its own challenges – but it absolutely can and will play a role in bringing safe, clean, and affordable transportation models to our roadways. Most public transit systems require significant capital investments in infrastructure and are typically designed to accommodate the greatest need (which, itself, is subject to opinion and bias). The challenge, then, is that services like trains and bus lines are restricted to just the number of stops and areas they can serve. As a city grows and evolves, the public transit systems often remain the same – becoming inaccessible to those who rely on it the most.
Amidst the rigidity of public transportation, we have the so-called last-mile problem: a situation where travelers are often not able to reach their exact destination, but are able to get within a few miles or so. Taxis, ridehailing, scooters, biking and walking are all possible solutions, but there can be financial, safety, or practical barriers associated with these. Many individuals purchase a car specifically to avoid public transportation, or don’t have access to it in the first place.
Image: Safe Routes Partnership
Demand for mobility-as-a-service has grown steadily over the past decade, especially in cities. This model brings many benefits, and at its best, can be genuinely complimentary to public transportation – but it has also left some people behind. Traditional ridehailing services can be unpredictable, especially with surge pricing and the recent shortage of drivers.
While modern-day ridehailing services have partially democratized the personal chauffeur, there are overhead costs that are passed on to the riders: for example, the expenses to pay drivers a living wage or the cost to cover deadheading (the term for when a vehicle is underutilized and drives around without charging for its miles). And while most drivers are safe and courteous with clean and well-maintained vehicles, unfortunately, that’s not always the case.MOBILITY
What is the World Economic Forum doing about mobility?
Show
With new technologies, we can build a more affordable and inclusive transportation system for even more of our communities. Our vehicles will be meaningfully safer than their human-driven counterparts. Over time, they will cost much less to use. They’ll create less pollution and use fewer resources, because they’re utilized all day and night long. Within their geofence, they won’t discriminate based on race or socioeconomic status. They’ll be reliably clean and well maintained. And they’ll be a pleasure to ride in, having been designed for exactly that.
The potential societal benefits are tremendous, but we still have a long and capital-intensive road ahead. Along this journey, there will be challenges; we certainly won’t solve everything for everyone right away. But we couldn’t be more excited to help address some of society’s oldest issues by dismantling historic transportation hurdles and bringing safe, clean and enjoyable transportation to everyone.

 The shared e-scooter could become as common on city streets as a bus, or even cars, according to those in the industry. 
By Skip Descant 
The shared e-scooter could become as common on city streets as a bus, or even cars, according to those in the industry.
“What
 was new, and kind of different over the last five years or so, scooters
 have become much more mainstream,” said Ashwini Chhabra, chief public 
policy officer at TIER Mobility, the world’s largest shared 
micromobility operator. The company recently acquired Spin. 
“They’ve  become more like how cities approached bike-share. And I think that  transition will continue to where I think these services will be  embraced much in the way that the city bus is considered to be as  American as the library and the post office,” Chhabra added, speaking on  a panel discussion last month at the CoMotion MIAMI conference. “It may  have started out as a private service, but it provides a public service  for a lot of our riders.” 
As anyone who follows urban mobility 
will tell you, e-scooters arrived on the scene about five years ago. 
They have weathered the rapid head-turning — and often criticism — from 
everyone from city officials to residents, who have both embraced and 
balked at these new mobility gadgets. Since then, regulations have been 
put in place, data sharing has been established, and most importantly, 
partnerships have taken root among scooter operators and other mobility 
providers like ride-hailing and transit. 
It is this evolution 
that most excites industry watchers like Chhabra, who pointed to the 
merging of micromobility with transit in a number of European cities as 
the kind of trend we could — and should — see in the U.S. 
“And 
so, there is this realization at some point, that you are actually 
growing the size of the pie by facilitating these introductions,” said 
Chhabra. 
To
 form those partnerships means “getting the digital right,” said 
Chhabra. But also, thinking through issues like the locations of 
mobility hubs, the placement of transit stops and the development of 
micromobility infrastructure like protected bike lanes. 
“The  places where we’ve seen the most successful programs are those where  MaaS [mobility as a service] and multimodality doesn’t exist  independently, but is part of a broader initiative to repurpose streets,  repurpose parking, away from car utilization alone,” said Chhabra. 
Merging  micromobility and transit can help regions meet some of the larger  transportation goals, particularly when thinking about sustainability or  equity, said Carlos Cruz-Casas, chief innovation officer of the  Miami-Dade County Department of Transportation and Public Works, adding  that incentivizing bikes and e-bikes could help riders travel farther  than they would on a scooter, and help to bring about other health  outcomes. 
“The more modes the better,” said Cruz-Casas, in some of his comments on the panel. 
He also noted transit agencies are taking on more modes under their operations 
“Bike-share
 started out as a private service. It’s quasi-public in many places now.
 And I can see a day when it’s much more akin to a bus service, because 
cities realize, this is actually a necessary service people are looking 
to us to provide,” he added. 
Other cities like Denver have taken a
 slightly different approach to encourage the use of micromobility. The 
city and county government recently launched a program to provide cash 
rebates for residents buying an e-bike or e-cargo bike. After only three
 weeks the city limited the program when it reached capacity. 
“The
 program has reached the maximum number of rebates that funding with 
allow,” Winna MacLaren, manager of communications and engagement in the 
Office of Climate Action, Sustainability and Resiliency in the city and 
county of Denver told Government Technology. The office will monitor how
 many of the vouchers are redeemed, and will “resume the program once we
 know how much funding remains after the initial rebate redemption 
period ends. 
“We
 do not anticipate all of the rebates that were issued in the first 
three weeks of the program will be redeemed. We also do have funding for
 a full second and third year of the program,” MacLaren added. 
The  vouchers provided $400 for an e-bike, or $900 toward the purchase of an  electric cargo bike. The rebates were higher for residents qualifying  as low income. Consequently, some 40 percent of the applicants were  “income-qualified,” said MacLaren.

The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) has seen a significant spike in transit ridership in recent months, and even more so in recent weeks as gas prices continue to ride. 
“MTS was budgeting for an 11 percent increase in ridership over last fiscal year. Our new estimates show ridership will jump 45 percent over the previous year,” said Sharon Cooney, MTS CEO. “We still have room to grow to get back to pre-pandemic levels, but these are great indicators. This sustained growth coupled with recent ridership spikes prove that people are motivated to save money, and still know that transit is a safe and affordable way to get around.” 
MTS has developed a dedicated webpage with a commute calculator for those interested in learning about the cost of driving alone vs. taking transit. The calculator factors in information such as commuting miles, estimated miles per gallon, parking costs, number of days commuting and price per gallon of fuel. The agency has also launched digital advertisements to educate commuters about the costs of driving vs. taking transit.  
Preliminary ridership estimates from last week show: 
Ridership was up to nearly 200,000 trips per weekday (197,000) for the week of March 7-11, which is approximately 70 percent of the pre-COVID-19 baseline.  This is the highest ridership has been since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trolley ridership has grown to more than 80 percent of pre-pandemic level. On Wednesday, March 9, ridership jumped 102 percent systemwide vs. the same day in 2021 There was a 111 percent ridership increase on trolleys. There was a 94 percent ridership increase on buses. 
Additionally, year-over-year comparison by month shows that ridership has consistently been significantly higher compared to last year. Even during the height of the Omicron surge in January, MTS transit ridership showed consistent improvement over 2021. In February, MTS hit its highest monthly increase in ridership over the same month last year. 
Another positive development for transit is that the UC San Diego Blue Line is performing well since the 11-mile extension to UTC opened in November 2021. The Blue Line is now averaging nearly 60,000 trips per weekday since the start of February. This is approximately a 33 percent ridership increase since the extension opened on Nov. 21.

The world, as we know it today, bears no resemblance whatsoever to the yesteryears. Advancements in technology have disrupted every possible industry and the automotive sector is no stranger to it. There has been an increasing change in the way people look at transportation. In fact, the very term and concept is being shifted from ‘transportation’ to ‘mobility.’ Where traditional transportation was a “system-centric” concept, modern mobility is completely “user-centric,” recognizing the fact that transportation must be responsive to the needs and preferences of commuters and society. Let’s find out why cities should rethink parking as ride-hailing services grows.
Ride-Hailing Services on the Rise
The new concept of shared-use mobility which lies at the centre of New Mobility Services (NMS) allows users access to various modes of transportation – bicycles, motorbikes, and cars – on a short-term and on-demand basis.
Mobility-as-a-service has emerged as a thriving concept with several push forces and enablers responsible for its popularity – one of the main push forces being a millennial aversion to car ownership. And what’s more, is that one of the main reasons the Gen-Z is against car ownership is the stress related to parking.
And the key enablers of ride-hailing services are smartphone applications and smart parking technologies such as IoT working in tandem to connect paying passengers with drivers who offer rides for a certain fee (for their private vehicles).
These ride-hailing services are easy to use and understand. Via a user-friendly smartphone application, the user simply needs to input their drop-off destination (with the pick-up destination either automatically entered through their phone’s GPS or manually entered on the map)and opt for the vehicle type (mini, micro, sedan, etc.) and the ride type (full or share) that best suits their needs and budget and book their ride.
Since these ride-hailing services recommend vehicles that are lurking nearby the pick-up location, the driver generally arrives within minutes of the booking. All that is now left to do is enjoy the ride and make the payment on arrival. How hassle-free is that!
How Cities are Coping with the Revenue Loss
Ever since the concept of mobility-as-a-service has emerged, there has been a bi-directional relationship between it and parking. And why not! After all, one of the top reasons cited for favouring ride-hailing services over car ownership is the increasing stress, hassle, and time and money loss involved in finding a vacant parking spot.
Ride-hailing does alter the parking demand. No longer is parking viewed as a necessary evil, with the degree of its necessity constantly decreasing. With ride-hailing services, people can easily access destinations of their choice without requiring an accompanying parking space. As a result, the demand for parking spaces is seeing a fall. This, in turn, has naturally led to revenue loss for the parking industry.
Cities are compelled to reduce the supply of parking spots and to look for alternative ways of allocating existing, unused parking infrastructure towards other needs and land uses. The diminished value and use of parking infrastructure offer the opportunity to put them to more in-demand and purposeful uses – parks, plazas, and similar elements – that make a city more lively and habitable.
Moreover, the low demand for parking spots owing to lesser driving trips and declining car ownership has proven to be insightful, allowing cities to rethink and better manage curb space – allocating more space for walking and bicycling, and most importantly, monetizing car trips (both private vehicles and ride-sharing vehicles) to cover up the losses incurred. For example – several airports have started charging ride-hailing vehicles a pick-up and drop-off fee for the curb space allotted to them.
Even the rise in mobility services such as ride-hailing can have their downsides – cab-sharing drivers wandering around with no passengers (dead-heading), unnecessary traffic congestions, and decline of sustainable travel options such as walking and bicycling. However, the root of the issue lies in the misuse of spaces – no proper space seems to be available for walking and bicycling.
Hence, the need of the hour is to make cities livable on a human scale with increased space for more sustainable transportation options and to allow technology to adapt to it – a truth more and more cities are waking up to.

This peak holiday season will be unlike any before, and brands must adapt accordingly. These unusual circumstances need to be met with creative solutions to ensure customer experiences do not skip a beat.
Among the many issues plaguing retailers this peak holiday season is the conundrum of last-mile delivery. With expected carrier delays due to increased ecommerce volume and surging transportation costs, retail brands must find a strategy to remedy this problem.
Aside from ordering an item online, delivery is the only other direct touchpoint a consumer will have with your brand. Variables such as carrier delays or transportation costs will be associated with your company if they negatively impact shoppers this holiday season. In this article, I will walk through a few ways to avoid this scenario by looking at alternative last-mile delivery options that will keep both consumers and brands happy.
Shortened Supply Chain: Pop-Ups or Micro Fulfillment
By reducing transit time for goods as much as possible, brands can remove much of the uncertainty involved in last mile delivery. This helps to solve two big problems many brands are facing this peak holiday season: Shipping delays and increased transportation costs.
With expected ecommerce volume at three times normal capacity, carriers are expected to experience delays in delivery times. Additionally, many are adding holiday surcharges based on distance, volume and proximity to the holidays.
To avoid these negative scenarios, retail brands should embrace alternative options like micro-fulfillment. This shortens the supply chain by dispersing product across various micro or pop-up distribution centers. Thus, transportation distances and shipping costs are decreased. Brands can leverage their existing infrastructure in new ways while delivering an optimal fulfillment experience for the holidays. This is crucial as over 700 million holiday packages are at risk of not arriving on time, according to Salesforce.
A New Application for the Gig Economy
Another solution this holiday season is tapping into the gig economy. Ridesharing platforms like Uber and Lyft, as well as food delivery apps DoorDash and Postmates, have risen as viable solutions to the last-mile delivery dilemma.
Many of these platforms already have a robust food delivery complement, so applying the same strategy to ecommerce fulfillment is a natural progression based on current market demands. This is a trend to watch as this holiday season will serve as a great litmus test for the role of the gig economy in last-mile delivery moving forward.
Shoppers should not be surprised if their packages are dropped off by a ridesharing platform as opposed to the typical carrier truck. The gig economy offers a more agile delivery solution and helps to localize the supply chain even further.
Expanding BOPIS and Curbside Capabilities
For shoppers who are disappointed in recent brick-and-mortar retail closings, the next best thing is a great experience with Buy Online, Pickup in Store (BOPIS). Shoring up curbside pickup should be a key priority for brands this peak holiday season and into 2021.
This option is safe for consumers and eliminates issues with transportation delays and surcharges. However, omnichannel brands must streamline their supply chains to make expanding curbside a viable plan. This includes ensuring products are dispersed proportionately across geographies and offering inventory transparency to shoppers across sales channels. This creates an urgency to buy and also lets consumers know when they can pick up items at various locations nearest to them.
As we dive further into the 2020 holidays, retailers will be constantly faced with new challenges. By tapping into alternative fulfillment options, you can offset some of these variables and in turn deliver great experiences for shoppers. Especially this year, the success of your last-mile delivery is critical to winning during peak holiday season, so you can’t afford to leave anything to chance.

IoT technology development gave a start to several interdisciplinary fields that combine IoT with other technologies and studies. One of the most well-known examples of such fields is telematics, a mix of telecommunications, IoT, electrical engineering, and the automotive industry.
While telematics can be applied to education and healthcare, one of its biggest use cases is vehicle telematics. It encompasses vehicle tracking, fleet management, and vehicle maintenance and brings undeniable advantages to the car-sharing industry.
Challenges of Carsharing
To fully comprehend vehicle telematics’ benefits, it is important to understand the actual challenges that the carsharing industry faces.
Carsharing is a car rental model where users rent a car for a short period of time. That means there is always a high user turnover and a very high unpredictability in car maintenance. Since a single car can be used by dozens of people with different driving styles, there is always a chance that some people will be speeding, will be inaccurate while driving, or will leave the engine idling.While telematics allows for easy vehicle monitoring and more accurate routing, it also brings specific benefits to the car-sharing industry by making the driving process safer and allowing better car maintenance.Click To Tweet
If we define the main challenges of the carsharing industry in terms of fleet management, they will be:
Car maintenance: are the drivers managing cars properly?The cost of idling: do cars spend too much time idling?Harsh braking and driving: are drivers speeding or driving inaccurately?Vehicle Location: where are the vehicles at the moment?
All these questions need to be answered to save money for a carsharing company. This is where telematics comes in place and helps resolve these issues.
Telematics: Overview and Benefits
As said above, telematics is a mix of telecommunications and informatics. It can be considered a subset of IoT since it deploys integrated sensors to obtain certain data.
A telematics device for vehicles is called a black box and contains the following components: a GPS receiver, accelerometer, engine interface, a SIM card, a buzzer, and the expander port. This black box captures the data that a vehicle generates (such as car position, speed, fuel consumption, tire pressure, etc.) and sends it to the cloud. In the cloud, the data is processed and analyzed further to the user’s choice application.
Summing up, the black box device provides you with detailed information on the car’s status and its current position–so how can you use this data to your advantage?
Improved Car Maintenance
Battery voltage, tire pressure, brake state – all these and other indicators can be monitored with telematics. Hence, if there is anything wrong with the car or the need for maintenance arises, car owners can react promptly and provide better car maintenance which, in turn, leads to a longer use period of a car.
Improved Operating Cost Management
With carsharing, fuel is usually included in the price, which means a user does not have to pay for it additionally. Hence, the issue of saving costs on fuel is quite acute for the owners of carsharing businesses.
Telematics allows to monitor several factors that affect fuel consumption:
IdlingDriving manner (aggressive driving increases fuel consumption)Weather (low temperatures promote higher fuel consumption)Use of accessories (air conditioning, etc.)
By knowing about such things, car owners can adjust their policy to reduce fuel consumption and cut down fuel costs.
Improved Driver Safety
Telematics offers multiple options for making the driving process safer for drivers. First, you can set up the device to notify the driver if there is a need for maintenance or to slow down (if the driver is speeding). This will naturally lead to a reduced number of dangerous situations.
Second, telematics enables carsharing companies to quickly and easily locate a vehicle. This option can be quite valuable when there is a need to locate a stolen vehicle or a vehicle in an emergency.
Telematics and Fleet Management
Today, there are many providers of telematics-based solutions that fleet owners successfully use. These solutions usually come in the form of a web and/or mobile application and have an admin and a user interface.
Using the data generated by the vehicle black box, the application displays advanced reporting and analytics, allowing easy management of every car in the fleet. Simultaneously, such applications allow users to see a car’s status before booking it and provide easy registration and payment processes. Advanced features may include limited access to vehicles (for authorized drivers only), emergency buttons for dangerous situations, and driver training while being on the road.
Telematics in carsharing provides one significant benefit: it allows the automatic collection of nearly impossible data to be collected manually. This data can further help car-sharing companies make better business decisions by knowing the real-time state of every car in the fleet. As for the drivers, telematics greatly contributes to their safety by monitoring their driving style and providing helpful suggestions during the ride. Hence, it’s safe to assume that telematics is here to stay and expand its presence as the digitization of the automotive industry continues to grow.

 Honolulu can increase the efficiency of its roads in all kinds of ways. 
By Sumner La Croix, Justin Tyndall

The COVID-19 pandemic imposed enormous costs on Honolulu’s population. Many businesses and schools closed their doors, the tourism industry ground to a halt, unemployment rose to record levels and … traffic declined to levels never before seen by even the longest-lived Honolulu resident.
Many marveled at how easy it was to get around the city. Of course, the light traffic was a by-product of lockdowns and mobility restrictions, but it did raise an important question: Was it really necessary to go back to the jam-packed roads of 2019?
Perhaps there were sensible ways to keep traffic at lower levels? If there were, state and city policymakers and bureaucrats seemed too preoccupied to think about them.
And now: The traffic is slowly returning. That’s because people have decided to venture out more to restaurants, gyms, social gatherings and workplaces. The good news is that traffic is still about 20% below 2019 heights.
Traffic returning is generally a good sign, reflecting more people being vaccinated and residents deciding they can engage in more activities in person.
But there is no reason for traffic to return to pre-pandemic levels. Voluntary actions, simple government programs and direct government intervention all have a role to play.

This graph, created from data collected across the entire state of Hawaii, shows the dramatic decrease in traffic brought on by the pandemic — as well as the gradual increase we are all now witnessing. During normal times, residents pay a huge price for congestion. A recent report on traffic in Hawaii estimated the cost of congestion in the state to be $690 million annually. This cost is mainly paid through lost time and productivity from workers sitting in gridlock. Smarter policy could eliminate this cost and direct the savings to local workers.
At low levels of use, most major roads can handle additional cars without traffic slowing appreciably. But at some level of traffic, just a few additional cars can slow traffic dramatically, which imposes costly delays on other drivers. The result in Hawaii is bumper-to-bumper, slow-moving traffic during rush hours on the H-1 and H-2 highways and other major arteries.
Policies that keep those last few cars off the road during rush hour can generate big social benefits. Fortunately, policymakers have an abundance of options to accomplish this, policies that have already been tested and proven in other cities.
Rush Hour Tolls And Other Ideas
The most direct and efficient way to limit traffic would be to levy an electronically monitored toll on congested roads during rush hour. Properly calibrated tolls could make intense rush hour congestion a relic of the past. To allay concerns that tolls would amount to a new tax, revenue could be rebated directly to local residents and even directed preferentially to lower-income households to allay any concerns that tolls would be regressive.
Looking beyond tolls, policymakers face a menu of measures that could improve traffic. Investments in TheBus or cycling infrastructure would help to get some people out of their cars. Rideshare programs are already in place and have potential to be more broadly applied. Giving incentives to local businesses to allow staggered work hours or more remote work would reduce the demand for rush hour commuting.
Despite the large potential gains from these measures, state and local governments across the United States and in Hawaii have struggled to implement effective policies. For example, workers have resisted schemes to stagger office hours and commuting times due to reasonable concerns that staggered and perhaps unpredictable hours will complicate coordination of drop-off and pick-up times for their schoolchildren.
COVID-19 has shaken up this worldview. By forcing so many people to work from home and change their commuting behavior, the pandemic has changed how employers and employees view the costs and benefits of a central workplace and of gathering workers there for fixed hours, Monday to Friday.
Both employers and employees have realized that some (but not all) workers can be as productive at home as in the office, at least some of the time. This has opened the door for employers to offer some employees the option of working from home one or more days per week. Social gains result from these private bargains, as fewer commuters means less traffic.
The same analysis applies to staggered hours. Moving commuting from traditional rush hours to slightly later in the morning has the potential to decrease rush-hour commuting times without adding much additional inconvenience to people commuting mid-morning.
An alternative is to charge a congestion zone fee to drive within the downtown area or perhaps the downtown-to-Waikiki corridor.
Local and state governments could help residents gain the additional social benefits from traffic control by providing incentives to private firms to stagger hours and/or keep more employees working at home. In fact, governments could take the lead on this by providing additional incentives for their own workforces to continue to work some days at home.
Consider that University of Hawaii campuses might accomplish this by not starting most on-campus classes until 10 a.m. and offering more early morning on-line classes.
Today, work from home arrangements have left Honolulu with less traffic congestion. Whether such arrangements will lead to less traffic congestion in the longer term is unclear and there is some reason to be pessimistic.
This is because of what is known as The Fundamental Law of Traffic Congestion: Once traffic lightens, people who found it too congested to drive to downtown Honolulu or Waikiki or Pearlridge Shopping Center will decide to make the trip. As more drivers take more trips, the roads are likely to once again become highly congested.
How To Move Forward
Is there a way out of this cycle, to reduce traffic to manageable levels permanently? Imposing a toll may be problematic due to federal regulations on tolling federally financed highways such as H-1 and H-2. An alternative is to charge a congestion zone fee to drive within the downtown area or perhaps the downtown-to-Waikiki corridor.
Fees to access congested areas have been widely studied and effectively used in other major cities, with London and Stockholm having perhaps the most effective applications. Administration has been smoothed in both cities by technology that monitors license plates entering the congestion zone.
The central Stockholm area is a group of islands, and this geography facilitates the collection of the congestion zone fee: It is charged, via bridges connecting islands, both when a car enters and leaves. The total daily fee varies by the time of entrance/exit and is capped at 135 krona ($16.20). The fee is not charged on public holidays, the day prior to the holiday or during July when most Stockholm residents are on holiday.
Cars driven within the central London congestion zone (an 8.1-square-mile area) pay a daily charge of £15 ($20.85) from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day but Christmas. Billing is based on technology that recognizes license plate numbers and deducts payment from a bank account; or the congestion charge can be pre-paid via an app or website. Residents living in or near the zone receive a 90% discount on the congestion charge. After the charge was implemented, the volume of traffic fell about 9% within the zone and home values within the zone increased.
A congestion zone fee in central Honolulu has been discussed as a complementary policy when the Honolulu rapid transit project reaches downtown, to encourage commuters and day-trippers to use the train. But a well-designed congestion zone fee, set perhaps at $5 to $10 per day, can yield big benefits prior to the train’s arrival in the 2030s.
If the congestion zone fee was in place only during weekday rush hours, workers and firms would have an incentive to allow for more flexible work hours. Workers would also have increased incentives to carpool or take TheBus. And when rush hour traffic improves, the incentives for other drivers to take more trips during rush hour is reduced because they too must also pay the congestion zone fee.
Perhaps the big lesson that we have learned from the pandemic is that we need to rethink the way that we approach certain activities. State and local government leaders have been heavily criticized because they did not take advantage of the downtime to implement better policies to control the costs imposed on the community by tourism.
While the same could be said for traffic, it’s not too late for us to plan for an island with less traffic. There’s no need to wait for the train for that goal to be realized.

 With public and private partners, Pittsburgh’s city government is the first in the country to launch a digital system coordinating local transit options. It represents the local entrance to an international sustainability-minded movement. 
 By Sophie Burkholder / STAFF 
Pittsburgh will soon be a national leader in mobility tech.
Earlier this month, the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure launched a two-year initiative called Move PGH, a comprehensive program convening private and public transportation options both physical and online to help Pittsburghers get where they need to go. Partners of the program include electric scooter rental company Spin, moped rental company Scoobi, local bike share system Healthy Ride, Waze Carpool and Transit, among others.
Move PGH centers around a robust app, powered by Transit, and 50 new physical mobility hubs across the city. While Transit has operated its services in Pittsburgh since 2013 and currently has over 40,000 users in the area, this new and improved digital hub will add even more transportation options to its current offerings.
Citing the recent growth of car ridesharing as well as shared bike and scooter systems, Move PGH underscores the need for a central place to find availability and pricing across all transportation options. Though Pittsburgh has been ranked as having the 15th best public transit system in the country and currently has 134,717 workers living within a half mile of transit, Port Authority has actually cut several services and routes over the last decade and saw sharp revenue drops during the pandemic.
Those cuts, paired with Pittsburgh’s hilly topography that can make walking or biking more difficult, mean that the 20% of residents without a car still struggle to get to work, the grocery store or other essential destinations. Transportation problems are inherently equity ones too, as over 65% of Pittsburgh’s low-income households don’t have access to a private car according to Move PGH.
One solution that’s gained popularity in recent years is what’s called Mobility as a Service, aka MaaS, which is the use of a digital platform to allows passengers to plan and pay for transportation across a wide range of public and private options. Such services could eventually make individual vehicle ownership obsolete.
“Mobility as a Service, ultimately, is about making sure people have access to the transportation services that can help them get around, easily, affordably, sustainably, when they need them,” said Transit Communications Lead Stephen Miller. “And so the City of Pittsburgh’s approach here was to really look at Mobility as a Service as a way to get these private companies and the public services that are available to really connect together and make sure that people in Pittsburgh have a way to access all of these together, rather than everybody kind of doing their own thing.”
While already a popular approach in Europe — with Helsinki planning to eliminate the need for personal cars by 2025 — Pittsburgh is the first city to adopt this approach in the United States. But Miller wasn’t surprised to see the local community pioneer this program. Unlike larger cities that often have a variety of extensive public transportation options, midsize cities like Pittsburgh have become more dominated by cars, giving local governments more urgency in connecting residents to alternative choices.
“It’s really forced a lot of cities and transit agencies in these types of midsize cities to think really creatively about how they can improve their services, and how they can be really thoughtful and creative about shifting trips to more sustainable options,” Miller said.
There are unique technical considerations as Mobility as a Service becomes widespread. A growing standard used in the field is the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), which several public transportation options, including Port Authority, have adopted as a way to share information with navigation apps like Transit or Google Maps. Meanwhile, many bikeshare companies use General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) while ride-hailing and taxi companies use General On-Demand Feed Specification (GOFS).
These differences aren’t a problem, Miller said: “Because each mode of transportation has different needs, it makes total sense that there would be different data standards for transit, scooters/bikeshare, and on-demand services.”
“Ultimately, all of these mobility pieces should be able to speak the same language and connect together so people can easily make these trips.”STEPHEN MILLER, TRANSIT
But there’s a challenge in making sure these standards are adopted broadly within the transportation field.
“Ultimately, all of these mobility pieces should be able to speak the same language and connect together so people can easily make these trips,” he said.
Beyond making transportation more accessible to residents, Mobility as a Service has the potential to significantly reduce emissions — a critical and persistent issue for Pittsburgh, which the American Lung Association recently ranked as the ninth worst city in the country for air quality.
Part of those pollution issues are undoubtedly associated with the heavy use of cars here. A September 2019 report from mobility analytics company INRIX showed that 23% of car trips in Pittsburgh were less than one mile, while 50% were less than three miles.
Miller sees Move PGH and future work in Mobility as a Service as a way of resolving that classic last-mile problem in transportation.
“Those are distances that are easily covered by either walking or biking or electric scooters or public transit,” he said. “And so making sure that we build up these options and make them easy enough to access for people so they’re not just grabbing the car keys to go a mile down the road is really important to shifting those trips to more sustainable modes.”

The National Transit Database found recently that public transit ridership in the United States plunged 62% in 2020, as COVID-19 took hold. One of the transit sector’s responses, though, has been to embrace health measures like new on-board air filtration systems, face-mask detection systems and, increasingly, contactless payments as a lure to regain those lost passengers.
The National Transit Database, which aggregates data from hundreds of transit agencies nationwide, estimated that 482 million fewer rides were taken in the last year than in 2019, as the pandemic made traveling in enclosed spaces a risky endeavor. Large transit agencies like New Jersey Transit and New York City’s Metropolitan Transit Authority have already experimented with sanitizing trains nightly, installing mask-detection cameras and offering mobile apps that show how crowded railcars are.
But the most popular solution among transit agencies and riders alike has been a growing embrace of contactless payment systems that enable riders to pay fares on their phones rather than using cash or swiping cards.
“The need to keep passengers and staff safe while providing reliable services has never been greater for public transit authorities,” Miroslav Katsarov, the chief executive of contactless payment manufacturer Modeshift, said in a press release. “We’re proud that 20 cities around the world have trusted us to implement contactless fare collection systems on their public transit networks, and we hope that riders feel safer using it.”
Modeshift recently launched its contactless mobile payment app on the local bus lines in Lancaster and Reading, Pennsylvania. The company’s software enables users to scan into public transit through a unique QR code generated on the app once they purchase their fare.
At least 12 of the 37 grants distributed last month by the Federal Transit Administration will be used by transit agencies to procure contactless payment systems like Modeshift’s. The South Central Transit Authority, which operates the bus systems in Lancaster and Reading, has seen improved ridership in the two months since it started taking mobile payments, said Dave Kilmer, the agency’s executive director.
“Since the start of the pandemic, we’ve seen a large decline in the number of public transit users across Berks and Lancaster counties.” Kilmer said in the Modeshift press release. “Since implementing Modeshift’s contactless fare collection system we’ve seen the adoption rate increase week over week, and now, 99% of our public transit users have migrated to the new system and prefer contactless payments for fares.”

Researchers say the future of transportation will be shaped by three “revolutions” – vehicle electrification, driverless cars and ride-sharing – that could result in fewer automobiles on the road, less fossil fuels extracted from the Earth and less pollution in the air. While the environmental gains may seem self-evident, the health benefits are difficult to quantify.
Now for the first time, a Cornell-led team has used transdisciplinary systems modeling to calculate those health benefits in the United States. By 2050, these innovations could potentially slash petroleum consumption by 50% and carbon dioxide emissions by 75% while simultaneously preventing 5,500 premature deaths, with an annual savings of $58 billion.
“There are all these important emerging trends in the development of transportation, and they are becoming a reality in the near future,” said Oliver Gao, the Howard Simpson Professor of civil and environmental engineering in the College of Engineering, who led the project.
“Have you ever thought about what all these revolutions mean for your health, for our climate, and for our environment, and for our energy systems?” Gao said. “These externalities don’t necessarily come directly in the mind of the general public, the travelers, or even the decision-makers.”
The group’s paper, “Shared Use of Electric Autonomous Vehicles: Air Quality and Health Impacts of Future Mobility in the United States,” published June 26 in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. The paper’s lead author is former postdoctoral researcher Shuai Pan.
“It is worthwhile to understand the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies, as deep de-carbonization is needed in the transportation sector,” Pan said.
Co-authors include Lewis M. Fulton from the University of California, Davis, and Yunsoo Choi and Jia Jung from the University of Houston. The research was supported by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Center for Transportation, Environment and Community Health, and by Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology.
While previous studies have looked at certain facets of transportation innovation, such as the impact of electric vehicles on fuel usage and emissions, this is the first time anyone has employed a transdisciplinary systems approach that factored in human health and the associated economic benefits, according to Gao.
Gao’s systematics research group – which uses modeling to understand complex global challenges in engineering, business, societal well-being and sustainability – is uniquely positioned for such a task.
“A transportation engineer cannot address these questions,” Gao said. “Environmental science cannot address these questions. A health researcher cannot address these questions. However, this transdisciplinary group can do this.”
Pan, Fulton and Gao built an integrated assessment system that included a technical-economic mobility model, a chemical transport model and a health impact assessment tool. Then they projected the vehicle stocks, distance traveled, energy usage and carbon dioxide emissions in the continental U.S. through 2050, and quantified the impacts of changing emissions on concentrations of fine particulate matter in the atmosphere, as well as the ensuing health and economic benefits of populations in 10 major metropolitan areas.
Their simulations show that, depending on how widely the three “revolutions” are adopted, reductions in emissions from passenger travel could prevent between 2,300 and 8,100 premature deaths annually in the U.S. in 2050.
The largest number of prevented deaths coincided with large metropolitan areas, such as Los Angeles and Chicago. At the state level, California, Texas, New York, Ohio and Florida would see the largest decreases in premature mortality.
The associated economic benefits could range from $24 billion to $84 billion annually.
The study hangs on a number of assumptions and uncertainties. After all, driverless cars are not yet commercially available, and sales of electric vehicles lag far behind conventional gas guzzlers.
“Another key finding is that for carbon mitigations and health benefits, vehicle electrification is by far the most important piece, followed by shared mobility (ride-sharing) and then automation, ” Pan said. “The net energy impacts of self-driving vehicles are highly uncertain and automation alone may not dramatically affect energy use, emissions or vehicle-related pollution. ”
A complicating factor is that the efficiency improvement and projected cost reduction from automation could actually lead to increased travel and offset other gains.
“If we automate the vehicles, you might make the transportation system more efficient, but probably more people will travel longer distances,” Gao said. “So there is a balance, there is a trade-off.”
The study concludes that policymakers can help encourage the transition to electric vehicles and boost ride sharing, for example, by issuing tighter fuel economy standards, creating economic incentives for shared mobility and investing in charging infrastructure and technological developments.
A future of autonomous flying taxis
Of course, actually creating such transportation innovations is not possible without first determining their viability.
Another research project from Gao’s lab – published July 6 in Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice – explores the feasibility of an airport shuttle service that uses autonomous flying taxis as a means to mitigate urban congestion. The paper’s lead author is Emily Lewis ’20.
“While you are stuck in traffic from JFK [International Airport] to Manhattan, have you ever thought, oh, I wish I could be a bird, just to fly there. Actually, that dream is not too far away,” said Gao, who directs Cornell’s Center for Transportation, Environment and Community Health. “But how do you even architect a whole system, from the technology to market prediction and to operation? Would such an idea make economic sense at all?”
The study focuses on the concept of urban air mobility – essentially a transportation service for low-altitude airspace in metropolitan areas that features autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles.
Gao’s team – which included co-authors Jesse Ponnock ’20, Qamar Cherqaoui ’20, Scott Holmdahl ’20,Yus Johnson ’20 and Alfred Wong ’20 – focused on the three busiest airports in the U.S.: Atlanta, Los Angeles and Dallas.
They used a holistic, system-architecture analysis to identify each area’s key stakeholders and the goals that meet their needs, such as fleet management, infrastructure, traffic control, safety, user experience, financial viability and performance. The modeling also took into account the relationships between annual profit, mean time between safety incidents, upfront costs and the number of passengers shuttled per day.
“Because of its geographic, meteorological and also demand factors, Los Angeles turns out to be the best case for a pilot city,” Gao said.
The analysis identified wealthy commuters, long-distance commuters, business executives, event attendees, emergency transportation and vacationers as potential early adopters of an air mobility system.
What would such a system actually look like from a passenger’s perspective? It might not be too different from the ride-sharing services of today. The analysis recommended the system use FIFO (first in, first out) queuing and a smartphone interface for passengers, which may sound familiar to anyone who has ever hailed an Uber on their phone.
Also recommended: a hybrid energy source that incorporates electric energy for the autonomous vehicles.
But vehicles and apps are only part of it. For an air mobility system to become a reality, it would need the infrastructure to support it.
“This is not actually as mature as electrification or even automation,” Gao said. “This is even further away down the road. We are not comparing urban air mobility to other modes or arguing this is a better mode. We’re just saying that now, given the interest, first you need to be able to architect this. And then you will have a better sense about cost.”

 One of the most persistent issues transit and transportation planners face is how to move their populations a mile or two. A few miles are often all that separates a rider’s front door from a transit stop; or the distance from a transit stop to an office. 
One of the most persistent issues transit and transportation planners face is how to move their populations a mile or two. A few miles are often all that separates a rider’s front door from a transit stop; or the distance from a transit stop to an office. It’s the dreaded “first-mile/last-mile” conundrum. And it often means the difference between taking the train or bus into work, or driving the car, often unaccompanied, and contributing to increasingly congested highways and growing greenhouse gas emissions. 
According to the American Public Transportation Association, every dollar invested in public transportation brings four times that in economic impact. So while it’s true that transit agencies tend to require investments that aren’t repaid in fares, an effective transit system does contribute to the economic vitality of a community.
Transit agencies large and small have launched many efforts to attract riders by making those first- and last-mile trips easier. It has often meant partnering with a private-sector transportation provider like Via or a transportation network company like Lyft or, increasingly, a bike- or scooter-share operator.
Just over a year ago, transit agencies in Los Angeles and Seattle launched partnerships with Via, a provider of on-demand, shared transit. Riders engage with the service much like they would a ride-hailing app, while folks without access to a smartphone can dial a call center for service. The pilot programs were funded by the Federal Transit Administration.
In Los Angeles, the pilot covered service to three distinct zones, with each ride starting or ending at transit stations within the service zones. One of the larger overarching missions for officials at L.A. Metro, the region’s transit agency, was reducing single-occupancy trips.

“If we’re doing that — and this certainly can contribute to that — we’re getting more people who used to travel alone to use alternative means,” said Joshua Schank, chief innovation officer for L.A. Metro. “And our initial data indicates that we are.
“A lot of people who were driving alone and parking at stations are saying they’re using this,” Schank added. “A lot of people who used to have a more cumbersome and long, challenging ride to stations are using this. Those are the types of metrics that we are looking at.
“Now, the question is, at some point, is it worth the amount of money we’re spending to get those outcomes? And, from our perspective, this has been a real win on that front,” Schank continued. “Because we’ve been coming in under budget. We have a partner that’s been very flexible, that has tried to accommodate what we’re trying to accomplish and really wants to work with us to meet those goals.”
Ridership has grown from week to week, with only 100 to 200 rides per week in the initial few weeks. As word of the service spread, however, ridership picked up to 3,500 rides a week prior to the slowdown brought on by the novel coronavirus, which took ridership down to 1,300 rides a week. Riders don’t pay when boarding, but instead pay their fare when transferring onto a connecting bus or train.
“It’s taken a while for word-of-mouth to get around, for people to know about the service. It definitely took time to grow that ridership. But it has been going up and up,” said Marie Sullivan, project manager for the mobility-on-demand pilot project. The program has expanded to now serve 10 Metro stations.
In Seattle, transit officials organized a similar year-long pilot with Via, connecting riders to five light rail stations. The pilot concluded near the end of March.
“The idea was to test the use of a transportation network company to provide first- and last-mile service, to make it easier for people to access our transit system, and to expand the access of those transportation network companies to populations who historically have been left out of being able to use on-demand services,” explained Casey Gifford, Innovative Mobility project manager for King County Metro.
The city of Seattle expressed interest in the project and contributed funding to expand its scope. Four of the five transit stops served by the on-demand service were located in Seattle, offering seven-day service at those four stations, 5 a.m. to 1 a.m., correlating with the service hours of the light rail system.
Ridership mostly followed the peak service seen during morning and afternoon commutes on the light rail system, and totaled about 1,000 rides per weekday.
“We also have a lot of youth who take advantage of the service. They’re using it to get to school, and get to jobs, and get to recreational opportunities.”

School-age riders also turned out to be frequent users of an on-demand shared transit program launched in Cupertino, Calif., in November 2019 as part of an 18-month pilot program, again using Via as the service provider.
“Generally, the community has been really supportive and happy with the program. The data we’re getting is really interesting. I think we went into this assuming it would be more something seniors would take advantage of, and maybe not the rest of the community as much. We’re seeing a really broad usage pattern,” said Chris Corrao, senior transportation planner in Cupertino, adding that a number of users of the program are turning out to be high-school-age riders who may use the service to get home from school or to afterschool events.
“Usually for these kinds of programs, you get the huge morning and afternoon peaks, and then sometimes quiet during the day,” said Corrao. “And we’re not seeing that at all. It’s just kind of busy all day, which is great. It’s expensive to run, so we want to make sure it’s as used as possible.”
The goal of the projects is to “leverage the transit infrastructure that these transit agencies have already built, and help bring more people to transit,” said Obinna Emenike, general manager of partners at Via, speaking during a panel discussion at the CoMotion LA conference last fall in downtown Los Angeles.
“Both of the services have been a success,” Emenike said of the projects in Los Angeles and Seattle. “I think we’ve hit every single one of the KPIs [key performance indicators] that we laid out, and the service continues to grow.”
Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority (CapMetro) in Austin, Texas, also partnered with Via to launch a new on-demand service now available in six zones, an expansion from one area back when the service was piloted two years ago. The expansion was due, in part, to the elimination of some of the fixed-route bus service following a system redesign, said Tony Lynch, supervisor of the Demand Response Planning department at CapMetro.
“Our Board of Directors requested that where we removed fixed-route, we have an alternative service,” said Lynch. “We determined Pickup was the best option for these locations. Each zone must have access to grocery stores and frequent fixed-route transit at a minimum.”
Ridership has grown since August last year, when it hovered around 80 to 100 riders a day, to 400 to 500 a day — or sometimes slightly more — by February. It has slipped significantly since service was adjusted for the coronavirus response.
The service is designed to both connect riders with regular, fixed-route transit and offer transit within the service zone.
“We determined that the zones must have trip generators like grocery, retail, post office, parks and connections to frequent bus service,” said Lynch. “Initially it looks like the majority of trips are taken to grocery stores and connecting to other transit. Of course, some customers use the service to visit friends and family who live within a particular Pickup zone.”

Not all public-private transit partnerships are formed with traditional transit. The service created in Cupertino is an example seen in a growing collection of small communities — the Silicon Valley city, home to Apple headquarters, has about 60,000 residents — where on-demand transit is the only option.
Cupertino will contribute about $1.2 million for its shuttle service.
“Which is no small amount,” said Corrao, “but it is significantly less than running a full community shuttle.”
In some cases, such as a proposal in Wilson, N.C. (pop. 50,000), communities are contemplating abandoning existing fixed-route transit service.
The city council in Wilson is considering a proposal to replace fixed-route transit service with an on-demand system operated by Via.
“It is very difficult to operate an efficient transit system without the economies of scale found in metropolitan areas, which is one reason most cities of our size do not provide public transportation,” said Grant Goings, city manager for Wilson, in a statement. “For years we have been looking for a technology-based solution that would increase our levels of service to the citizens while containing costs. We believe this public-private partnership provides such an opportunity.”
Other partnerships have formed between transit agencies and transportation network companies (TNCs) like Lyft or Uber. The Transportation Authority for Marin County, Calif., launched a program three years ago to provide up to a $5 per ride credit for users of the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART), a newly launched commuter rail service for the area north of San Francisco. The program was expanded this year to include two new SMART stations in an effort to grow ridership on the train as well as reduce congestion and air pollution.
Another pilot program that involved a partnership with both Lyft and Via to get riders to light rail stops in the Denver metro area in 2016 was ultimately discontinued due to the high cost of providing service that complied with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Officials say measuring success for these programs — and continuing their operation — is based on a number of factors. And the coronavirus crisis represents the newest curve ball thrown at transit.
“We’re still working with our partners to determine what’s going to happen,” said Gifford at King County Metro, in an interview in early April. The future is less sure given “the new wave of uncertainty that’s come upon us pretty rapidly,” she added.
In Cupertino, ridership data from March and April showed that most users were no longer using the service to get to school or connecting to Caltrain stations like they had been.
“Now, all of our trips are, like, to Target and Whole Foods,” said Corrao.
“We almost considered pausing the program,” due to low ridership, he added. “But we decided, if people are using it, even if it’s a lot less, then we want to have the option for them.”
The city and Via have suspended shared rides in order to maintain physical distancing requirements.
In Los Angeles, Schank said Metro plans to explore other on-demand transit opportunities.
“Our partner remains the people who need it most,” he said plainly. “So that is always what we’re going to be looking for. Where are the places where first- and last-mile options are not great? And we’ve got economically disadvantaged communities we can serve.”
What the new era brought on by the coronavirus has demonstrated is the benefits of a system quick to respond to by-the-moment changes, said Sullivan.
“One thing that service has been able to show, in the midst of this crisis, is flexibility that is inherent in the service model,” she remarked.
In Seattle, ridership numbers are but one metric, said Gifford.
“We’re also looking at who is riding. And equity is one of our core components, or core goals, at King County Metro.”
One of the goals of the program was to serve disadvantaged communities as well as to ensure the service was accessible for riders of all abilities.
“We are also looking at sustainability and the safety of the service,” said Gifford, adding, “ultimately, we’re going to have to take into account the financial situation.”
And of course, all transit agencies are exploring any number of partnerships.
“We’re all about innovating and testing new ways to facilitate access to mobility for our customers,” said Gifford. “And we’re really excited to have more tools in our toolbox for us to leverage. We know that a 40-foot bus is not always going to meet the needs of all of our users, so we are all about testing a range of different mobility options for different populations, for different contexts, to see what works best for each community.”

 With public and private partners, Pittsburgh’s city government is the first in the country to launch a digital system coordinating local transit options. It represents the local entrance to an international sustainability-minded movement.  Pittsburgh will soon be a national leader in mobility tech. 
By Sophie Burkholder / STAFF 
Earlier this month, the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure launched a two-year initiative called Move PGH, a comprehensive program convening private and public transportation options both physical and online to help Pittsburghers get where they need to go. Partners of the program include electric scooter rental company Spin, moped rental company Scoobi, local bike share system Healthy Ride, Waze Carpool and Transit, among others.
Move PGH centers around a robust app, powered by Transit, and 50 new physical mobility hubs across the city. While Transit has operated its services in Pittsburgh since 2013 and currently has over 40,000 users in the area, this new and improved digital hub will add even more transportation options to its current offerings.
Citing the recent growth of car ridesharing as well as shared bike and scooter systems, Move PGH underscores the need for a central place to find availability and pricing across all transportation options. Though Pittsburgh has been ranked as having the 15th best public transit system in the country and currently has 134,717 workers living within a half mile of transit, Port Authority has actually cut several services and routes over the last decade and saw sharp revenue drops during the pandemic.
Those cuts, paired with Pittsburgh’s hilly topography that can make walking or biking more difficult, mean that the 20% of residents without a car still struggle to get to work, the grocery store or other essential destinations. Transportation problems are inherently equity ones too, as over 65% of Pittsburgh’s low-income households don’t have access to a private car according to Move PGH.
One solution that’s gained popularity in recent years is what’s called Mobility as a Service, aka MaaS, which is the use of a digital platform to allows passengers to plan and pay for transportation across a wide range of public and private options. Such services could eventually make individual vehicle ownership obsolete.
“Mobility as a service, ultimately, is about making sure people have access to the transportation services that can help them get around, easily, affordably, sustainably, when they need them.”STEPHEN MILLER, TRANSIT
 “And so the City of Pittsburgh’s approach here was to really look at Mobility as a Service as a way to get these private companies and the public services that are available to really connect together and make sure that people in Pittsburgh have a way to access all of these together, rather than everybody kind of doing their own thing.”
While already a popular approach in Europe — with Helsinki planning to eliminate the need for personal cars by 2025 — Pittsburgh is the first city to adopt this approach in the United States. But Miller wasn’t surprised to see the local community pioneer this program. Unlike larger cities that often have a variety of extensive public transportation options, midsize cities like Pittsburgh have become more dominated by cars, giving local governments more urgency in connecting residents to alternative choices.
“It’s really forced a lot of cities and transit agencies in these types of midsize cities to think really creatively about how they can improve their services, and how they can be really thoughtful and creative about shifting trips to more sustainable options,” Miller said.
There are unique technical considerations as Mobility as a Service becomes widespread. A growing standard used in the field is the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), which several public transportation options, including Port Authority, have adopted as a way to share information with navigation apps like Transit or Google Maps. Meanwhile, many bikeshare companies use General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) while ride-hailing and taxi companies use General On-Demand Feed Specification (GOFS).
These differences aren’t a problem, Miller said: “Because each mode of transportation has different needs, it makes total sense that there would be different data standards for transit, scooters/bikeshare, and on-demand services.”
“Ultimately, all of these mobility pieces should be able to speak the same language and connect together so people can easily make these trips.”STEPHEN MILLER, TRANSIT
But there’s a challenge in making sure these standards are adopted broadly within the transportation field.
“Ultimately, all of these mobility pieces should be able to speak the same language and connect together so people can easily make these trips,” he said.
Beyond making transportation more accessible to residents, Mobility as a Service has the potential to significantly reduce emissions — a critical and persistent issue for Pittsburgh, which the American Lung Association recently ranked as the ninth worst city in the country for air quality.
Part of those pollution issues are undoubtedly associated with the heavy use of cars here. A September 2019 report from mobility analytics company INRIX showed that 23% of car trips in Pittsburgh were less than one mile, while 50% were less than three miles.
Miller sees Move PGH and future work in Mobility as a Service as a way of resolving that classic last-mile problem in transportation.
“Those are distances that are easily covered by either walking or biking or electric scooters or public transit,” he said. “And so making sure that we build up these options and make them easy enough to access for people so they’re not just grabbing the car keys to go a mile down the road is really important to shifting those trips to more sustainable modes.”

Even a parked car is a source of stress.
Like when you run outside in your pajamas at the sound of the street sweeper coming. Cars left unattended for days might become a target for theft or vandals. They still need routine maintenance, the occasional car wash and a drive every few weeks to circulate the fluids and recharge the battery.
So with the pandemic changing the way we work, commute and shop, there’s probably no better time to see what life feels like without a car.
Here are four reasons to consider a car-free future:
1. You don’t (and won’t) drive much anymore
How many days last week did your car just sit? How many miles have you put on it in the past month?
When the pandemic hit, many companies sent their employees home to work remotely. Total miles driven plunged by 40% nationally in the second half of March, according to insurance data analyst Arity. Driving is on the rise again, but the interlude showed that we can get along just fine without everyone having their own car.
But you’re still making the same car payment as when you drove every day.
2. You have better uses for that money
Americans have long been encouraged to overspend on cars, urged on by ads that promise the right car will make us popular or rugged and unlock the freedom of the great outdoors.
The average American spent $773.50 a month, or $9,282 a year, on their car in 2019, according to AAA. That’s mainly because car payments are so high: Experian says in 2019 the average monthly payment for a new car was $554, and the average for a used vehicle was $391.
If you’re struggling to make ends meet, ditching the car payment would be a huge savings, not to mention the related expenses of gas, insurance, maintenance and repairs. If you’re not hurting, that’s money that can go toward a home down payment, a Roth IRA or paying down debt.
Why not take a look at exactly how much you pay — and how much you could save — with our handy total cost of ownership calculator?
3. You can cash in on high used car prices
If you do decide to part with your car, it’s a seller’s market. The average price of a used car listing rose by $708 from June to July, according to Edmunds, which called the trend “an unprecedented historical shift in the used vehicle market.”
Year over year, the value of used cars is up 16%, according to auctioneer Manheim’s Used Vehicle Value Index.
More good news: Selling your used car is easier than ever. Online used car retailers such as Carvana, Shift and Vroom will give you an upfront price and pick up your car from your home. Or, sell your car to a local dealer who’s probably hungry for trade-ins for the used car lot.
If you sell, consider protecting your assets with a non-owner car insurance policy. It offers liability protection if you borrow or rent a car and the owner’s own limits are exceeded. And if you were to buy another car yourself, you wouldn’t be penalized for a gap in insurance coverage.
4. You have options when the need arises
The pandemic has opened our eyes to the possibilities of delivery: groceries, takeout meals, school supplies and area rugs.
And to the joys of walking, too. What’s within walking or cycling distance? A few minutes with Google Maps might surprise you.
Car trips of less than a mile add up to 10 billion miles a year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Replacing those trips with walking or biking will not only help keep you fit, but also save you money on gas and cut down on pollution.
But sometimes you still need a car. Many transportation services that were initially locked down are up and running, offering contactless service at reduced prices with new safety measures.
Here’s what’s available for longer-than-cycling distances:
Taxis and ridesharing services.Car-sharing companies such as Zipcar.Rides from a friend.Rental cars and peer-to-peer car rental sites such as Turo.Public transportation.

Whether it’s ride-sharing, connected public transportation systems, autonomous vehicles or electric scooters, the ways we get around our cities are changing.
Technological and digital advances designed to make the task of getting from point A to point B easier and more efficient will shape the future of mobility. Those electric scooters popping up on the streets of many cities are just the latest demonstration that mobility is indeed changing. They also underscore some of the challenges to be overcome.
The days of commuting in self-owned cars with a single passenger may be numbered. With the rise of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and smart cities, your morning trip to the office might soon start with a combination of smart transport options that consider real-time traffic conditions to deliver you to your destination as quickly as possible.
“Today we have many different mobility options available to us: ride-sharing, car-sharing, subscription auto lease, autonomous vehicles, scooter-sharing, bike-sharing plus public transportation,” says Jillian Slyfield, Digital Economy practice leader at Aon.
“If you go back just a year ago, each of those modalities were unique,” Slyfield says. “Now, in certain markets, you can use a ride-sharing app and see an end-to-end solution for your transportation needs. It might involve a ride-share to public transportation, then public transportation to a point where you get on a scooter for the last mile. The process takes you through your journey in the most efficient manner.”
IN DEPTH
The technology propelling these new forms of mobility is designed to get people around more efficiently. But achieving the best outcomes requires properly integrating the new modes into urban transportation planning and developing regulations that appropriately address the new forms of travel.
The future of MaaS will see us using multiple modes of transportation – such as ride-sharing, car-sharing, subscription cars, autonomous vehicles, platform-enabled delivery services, bike-sharing and electric scooters. A hub-based transportation system can then link various modes together at key points in the city and coordinate targeted services, such as grocery delivery, at key intersections in the journey.
COORDINATING WITH EXISTING TRANSIT OPTIONS
As the mobility landscape evolves, some public-transit agencies are finding ways to use MaaS for serving travelers better and stem declining passenger numbers.
“Thirty-one of the 35 largest transit agencies have seen ridership decline due to new travel options, in addition to factors such as sustained lower gas prices, an increase in teleworking and service cuts,” says Otis Tolbert, managing director and Rail & Transit practice leader at Aon. “The transit community recognizes the trend, so it’s trying some new things to remain an important part of the transportation landscape.”
One option being explored by transit agencies is mobility on demand, which provides riders with vouchers that cover the cost of ride-sharing rides or even of scooter rentals to and from train stations. This approach seeks to address several perceived inconveniences – chiefly, in taking a bus to and from a train stop, or in the hassle of parking at a train station. As a bonus, the option also reduces the need for parking spaces and garages in already congested areas. Plus, partnering with ride-sharing services might also enable transit agencies to better serve customers when construction projects or breakdowns interrupt normal service along certain routes.
For a small number of U.S. cities – such as Houston, Phoenix, or Seattle – a renewed focus on transit-system quality has increased their ridership. Seattle’s bus and light-rail systems have seen gains thanks to voter-supported system expansions and improvements that bring more frequent, reliable service. And a partnership between Washington state and large employers helps workers find alternatives to solo commutes by car.
NEW TRAVEL OPTIONS BRING NEW RISKS, LIABILITY QUESTIONS
As new modes of transportation are added to the mobility mix, they raise questions of risk and liability. Transit agencies partnering with ride-sharing firms are determining how to appropriately assign risk and potential liability.
Ride-sharing is a developed market, so while regulations might vary by state or country – prompting some confusion for travelers – most jurisdictions mandate fairly standard levels of protections for riders, Slyfield says. Still, questions around determining liability remain, she says, likely with a variety of answers. “It’s not going to be a federal answer,” she adds. “Certainly not a global answer.”
Scooters bring a number of questions around risk and liability as cities, states and countries take varying stances toward their regulation and responsibility for liability. As electric scooters have become more commonplace in cities around the world, so have accidents involving them. As of June 2017, accidents involving rentable scooters had caused at least eight deaths in the U.S.
The question of whether scooter rental companies will be held liable for losses such as third-party injuries – such as when a rider hits and injures a pedestrian – will be critical to the industry’s survival, according to Slyfield. “By comparison, rental car companies aren’t held liable if you injure someone while driving a rental car,” she says.
Scooter riders may eventually take out individual insurance policies written to cover liabilities associated with scooter use, Slyfield says, particularly as some homeowner’s insurers exclude scooter risks. Indeed, complying with local law, Singapore-based scooter rental firm Beam recently began providing personal accident insurance to scooter riders in Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, and New Zealand.
THE FUTURE OF MOBILITY: SMARTER, MORE EFFICIENT
Technology has introduced new modes of transportation into the mix, reshaping how we get around our cities. As those modes mature and more new options are introduced, mobility will continue to evolve.
“It’s all about what is the most efficient form of transportation, given what’s happening with traffic patterns at any point in time,” says Slyfield. “That’s where we’ll see interconnectedness with sensors and smart cities as well as consumer feedback – using that data with apps and these new modes of transportation to provide an efficient travel recommendation.”

Catching up with the man himself, just a few months into his new role, we discussed why he returned to Avis Budget Group, the impact of ride-sharing apps on traditional car rental, the future of mobility and a whole lot more…
 
TD: You have had a long history with Avis Budget Group, going back to 1998, and had experience in key roles — what brings you back to Avis Budget Group? 
Keith Rankin (KR): My background with the company has given me the opportunity to experience different areas of the business first-hand, and I am delighted to be back at a time when we are experiencing one of the most significant shifts in the mobility landscape around the world.

“We are in a great position to lead this mobility revolution”

My most recent position was the chief executive for the automotive division at Barloworld in South Africa, which is a licensee partner of Avis Budget Group. However, my journey with the company started over 20 years ago, in 1998 within the financial planning department.
I believe we are in a great position to lead this mobility revolution and become one of the leading voices shaping the future of mobility.
TD: How has the company changed in the time that you were away?
KR: Avis Budget Group has been constantly innovating and evolving to meet the new expectations of its customers.
It has formed a range of new partnerships and developed its services to ensure that it remains at the forefront and delivers mobility services to the high standard its customers expect. The Group has been building new platforms, developing technologies and capabilities to further revolutionise the rental experience, and evolving our business to meet the present and future needs of our customers. 
TD: How have ride-sharing apps like Uber, and specifically in Asia, Grab – affected Avis Budget Group?
KR: For our core business, our average rental globally is four days and 450 miles. These distances and timeframes are different from what a ride-sharing customer is looking for. Therefore, I would say there is a different need, customer and opportunity for traditional car rental and ride-sharing apps. However, ride-sharing apps like Uber and Grab do highlight how consumers are increasingly viewing transport as an on-demand and personalised service. This is consistent with what we see as the future of mobility, namely a fully integrated, connected, on-demand and personalised mobility landscape.

“The future of mobility is dependent on a fully connected travel ecosystem”

A recent report from Avis Budget Group ‘The Road Ahead: The Future of Mobility’, revealed 82% of consumers across 16 markets in Europe and Asia said owning a car is still important, but more than half (54%) are prepared to give up car ownership and rely on on-demand, long-term rental subscription services within the next decade. 
When looking at this trend in Asia, it’s interesting to see the uptake of Zipcar, the world’s leading car-sharing network that is owned and operated by Avis Budget Group. In Taiwan, Zipcar currently has 10,000 members with approximately 100 cars in the fleet to provide convenience to our customers. This demonstrates the change in consumer mobility behaviours as drivers become open to using alternative mobility services to access a vehicle.
Furthermore, the report highlights the importance of mobility partnerships to improve the overall travel experience. The future of mobility is dependent on a fully connected travel ecosystem where different modes of transport work together to provide a streamlined and on-demand service. We are already demonstrating the success of this, for example in America we have partnered with Lyft, the fastest-growing ride-sharing company.
TD: You are responsible for Europe, the Middle East, Africa (EMEA), Asia, Australia and New Zealand. How important is Asia to the global success of Avis Budget Group?
KR: Asia remains a key part of Avis Budget Group’s global success, and we are currently present in over 20 Asian markets. The car rental market in this region is expected to grow exponentially in the next five years as levels of disposable income continue to increase, as well as the number of people obtaining driving licenses. For instance, in 2018 nearly 370 million people in China held a driver’s license.
TD: How does the Asian market differ from the rest of the world?
KR: Avis Budget Group is present in more than 11,000 locations and over 180 countries around the world, we do not believe in a one-size-fits-all approach, but instead combine a sense of consistency for our customers, with individual market needs. The Asian markets are nuanced, and the trends for customer groups in each market are diverse. To ensure we are meeting these trends effectively, we work closely with local businesses in the Asian markets to demonstrate our commitment to shaping the mobility industry.

“Technology, and the future of mobility, is where the real opportunity lies for us”

For the region as a whole, there is a lot of potential for growth and, given our successful track record in the mobility industry, Avis Budget Group is well-positioned to continue building on our momentum and drive growth for years to come.
TD: The travel industry (in fact most industries) has an obsession with digitalisation, what does this do for Avis Budget Group and how will benefit the customer?
KR: Technology, and the future of mobility, is where the real opportunity lies for us. We have a global fleet which we are working towards fully connecting. This will allow us to provide a data-driven intelligent mobility service meeting the mobility needs of both individuals and businesses. 
Our access to technology and data has allowed us to acquire deep expertise in global fleet management, and having a connected fleet means that critical data such as mileage, fuel level, and vehicle condition can be shared in real-time. This results in better-maintained vehicles and overall better customer experience. Through digital innovation, from connected cars to cloud-based platforms and mobile apps, we have been continually reinventing the rental experience.
TD: What other trends do you think will impact car rentals in Asia over the next few years?
KR: Asia Pacific destinations such as Australia, New Zealand and Japan are becoming increasingly popular as road trip destinations by Asian travellers and travellers around the world. As more people choose to go on self-drive holidays in Asia to discover hidden gems by car, and as more people access their driving licenses, we can expect demand for car rental in Asia to increase as well.

“It is critical that we are constantly innovating”

Undertourism or less-frequented destinations is another trend that might potentially increase the demand for car rental in Asia. As awareness of overtourism increases, more travellers are seeking undiscovered and eco-friendly destinations for their holidays. As such places tend to lack a well-developed public transport system, cars would be the most convenient mode of transport, indirectly increasing the demand for car rental.
TD: Avis Budget Group has a record of forging practical but forward-thinking partnerships, such as Amazon and Arrive – what impact have these relationships have on the business and how important are they to the company’s future?
KR: As the first car rental company to host its platform on Amazon Web Services, Avis Budget Group has demonstrated its commitment to revolutionise and lead the way in the future of mobility. With the rapid pace of technological advancements, it is critical that we are constantly innovating and forging forward-thinking partnerships that will help us to be a step ahead of competitors.

“We are always on a lookout for new partnerships”

Our partnerships are just the start of the future of mobility and they demonstrate how industry specialists need to work together to provide the best mobility services for consumers. We are proud to be leading the way in showcasing the success and importance of all travel services working together. We are excited about what the future holds for new and current partnerships.
TD: What partnerships have you made in this part of the world and what are you looking for in a partner?
KR: Avis Budget Group for the Asia region has been focusing on outbound self-drive holidays from Asia to the world for both the Avis and Budget brands. This is due to a growing demand for self-drive holidays among Asian travellers looking for new and unique travel experiences to undiscovered and lesser-known locations by road.
In 2019, Avis partnered with Mediterranean Luxe on a tourism campaign for the second year running to inspire Asian travellers to explore some of Mediterranean Europe’s most scenic spots by road, covering France, Monaco, Spain, Catalonia and Croatia.

“There is a thirst… to deliver more on-demand, connected and personalised mobility solutions”

Partnerships with travel and mobility service providers are an important part of our business and we are always on a lookout for new partnerships to improve the overall travel experience for our customers. We believe that all travel and transport services must become fully integrated and connected, whether this is a new or existing service, to ensure the industry is meeting the requirements of its customers.
TD: What excites you most about the future of Avis Budget Group?
KR: For today and the future, the shifting mobility landscape is our biggest and most exciting opportunity.
The technology revolution, coupled with changing consumer needs, means there is a thirst and opportunity to deliver more on-demand, connected and personalised mobility solutions to businesses and consumers. With this opportunity, there is a need to innovate existing services and be willing to take risks to move forward. With over 70 years’ experience and 11,000 locations around the world, Avis Budget Group is in a great position to not only be part of this mobility revolution – but also to help lead the way.

 Mobility-as-a-Service has the potential to enhance commuter travel and contribute to Singapore’s vision of a “car-lite” city. 
General Motors’ Futurama exhibit at the 1939 World’s Fair in New York City offered a vision of mobility made possible by the comfort and convenience of motor vehicles. Many ideas introduced in Futurama have since shaped the built environment around the world as cars and car ownership came to dominate the city. Road networks, motorways and ring roads now define the structure of many cities. Almost 80 years later, this car-centric utopia has brought severe side-effects, including pollution and traffic congestion.
In many modern metropolises, car ownership is no longer practical, nor desirable, but improved mobility is needed more than ever. Singapore’s urban planners have envisioned a car-lite future in which residents depend less on private car ownership and travel mainly via cycling, walking and public transport. Land, once set aside for roads and parking spaces, could instead be used for other purposes. Mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) is one such innovation that could support the car-lite push.
Shifting commuter preferences
MaaS brings together public transport with private sector offerings such as ride-sharing and bike-sharing together on one platform. By integrating end-to-end trip planning, booking, electronic ticketing, and payment services across all modes of transportation—be it public, private or on-demand—MaaS can facilitate seamless travel and help mitigate some first-mile and last-mile challenges.
As our transit infrastructure continues to evolve, both our habits and ways of getting around are also shifting. Our view of the “last mile” has changed over time and how we interact with technology is changing our mobility future, which may help the adoption of MaaS, as commuters increasingly favour access to services over ownership1.
Dr Maria Kamargianni, Assistant Professor in Transport and Energy and Head of MaaSLab, Energy Institution at University College London, agrees. “Car ownership is not that popular anymore. It causes a lot of pain points and it increases a lot of expenses of the households”, she explains.
A shift in commuter preferences may already be happening. A recent Land Transport Authority (LTA) survey showed that trips made via private vehicles dipped for the first time in almost two decades in 2016, while public transport journeys hit a record high in the same year2. Users can also benefit from the convenience when it comes to payment as they can easily pay via a single interface.
Besides enhancing the travel experience of commuters, MaaS can improve the city by reducing vehicle ownership and the need for car parks, in turn bringing down traffic congestion. Public spaces can then be redesigned to be more pedestrian-oriented and cyclist-friendly. Of course, fewer cars on the roads would also translate to better air quality and a reduced carbon footprint.
Global application of MaaS
MaaS has already made inroads in various cities around the world, albeit at the prototype stage. In the United States, ride sharing companies Via, Lyft and Uber are testing out MaaS by offering shared passes that integrate other forms of transportation such as bicycles and electric bikes, and are beginning to integrate public transport.
Sampo Hietanen, the co-founder of Finnish company MaaS Global, explains that one of the main challenges of MaaS adoption is getting public and private players on board, which requires data sharing among partners to be able to integrate ticketing and payment services, as well as streamlined regulation to create a level playing field.
Hietanen also believes that one key element that many MaaS operators have missed is the element of freedom, which MaaS Global’s app, Whim, hopes to address. Whim allows residents to plan and pay for all modes of public and private transportation from its platform. In Helsinki, where Whim has been on trial since 2016, users can choose between a pay-as-you-go plan, or pay €49 ($75) per month for a package that includes public transit, bike-share, and limited ride-sharing. A €499 per month package replaces personal car ownership by including unlimited taxi and car-sharing.
“Within the subscription world, to be able to really compete against car ownership, there has to be an element of individual freedom. That means we will not have only one subscription to fit them all. The idea is to have a huge variety, from the really high-end packages to really affordable ones. But the same basic idea has to be there – that you have a sense of freedom anywhere, anytime, on a whim”, Hietanen explains.
“We envisage Singapore to be the first real big city where we get to really show the world how disruption in transportation really looks like – bringing convenience, individual freedom, but also system benefits. And the city has a chance of looking better”, Hietanen says.
Potential of MaaS in Singapore
“Urban planning plays an important role when it comes to the success of MaaS”, says Colin Lim, CEO of mobilityX, a SMRT seed-funded start-up that aims to provide MaaS solutions to both commuters and companies.
MobilityX is currently working with Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and JTC Corporation to pilot a MaaS project through Jalan and JalanX. Jalan is an app that integrates train and bus networks with next-generation transport modes, including autonomous vehicles, bicycle-sharing systems and personal mobility devices such as e-scooters, while JalanX is an experimental on-demand bus service serving NTU’s campus and JTC’s CleanTech Park, connecting them to residential estates.
On the NTU campus, Lim and his team are exploring the idea of building car parks at each of the university’s defined entrances, where commuters can park their cars and continue their journey within the campus using other transport modes. With a good internal transport system consisting of shared scooters, bikes, on-demand bus services, and autonomous vehicles, a car-lite framework would be more feasible, he explains.
LTA is already rolling out dedicated cycling networks across public housing estates and is redesigning road spaces to be more pedestrian-oriented and cyclist-friendly3. With more people-friendly infrastructure, MaaS has the potential to facilitate seamless point-to-point journeys. One example of this might be building stations for shared scooters and bicycles at MRT stations, which would allow consumers to unlock a shared bike, cycle to the MRT station and board the train seamlessly, Mr Lim says.
With a wide range of transport services already available in Singapore, Dr Kamargianni believes that the country will be able to meet commuter demand if MaaS is launched. With the country’s high population density, and strict policies on car ownership and car growth, effective implementation of MaaS is possible, but only if the issue of combining all existing modes of transport can be integrated on into a single platform can be resolved, she explains.
Hence, MaaS has the potential to contribute towards Singapore’s car-lite vision by inducing people to drive less, or perhaps not get a car at all, which would free up land resources and reduce pollution by shifting commuters towards more sustainable forms of transport. However, policymakers must continue to work closely with transport operators, data providers and research bodies to ensure its effective and efficient implementation.

Google Maps may be working on a feature that will give users the most accessible transport options.
Wong stated that users will get multiple options to use their modes of transport for the first mile of transport.
These connections to public transit route options would cover first-mile transportation right from bikes, cars, motorcycles, and auto-rickshaws as well.



Google Maps has been introducing features to make things convenient for its users. The 15-year-old app recently rolled out tools so that users can spot grocery stores and COVID 19 testing centres on the app.
Jane Manchun Wong who keeps track of the developments happening in Facebook, Twitter, and other apps has noted that Google may be working on a feature that will connect users to multiple transport options with public transit.
In a series of tweets, Wong stated that users will get multiple options to use their modes of transport for the first mile which is a little over 1 kilometer.
These connections to public transit route options would cover first-mile transportation right from bikes, cars, motorcycles, and auto-rickshaws as well. The options will also include ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, a report by 9to5 Google stated.
The development, if it materialises, will be quite a big one as it will come in handy for users post lockdown period. Moreover, there will not be a need to switch between multiple apps if this happens.
The report also stated that the new Maps filter would allow users to pick and choose the types of transportation users would opt for in the first mile as well as the last mile on a daily commute.
Google will also inform commuters about the fares of the transport they would use. Google would link through the ride-sharing app to get an estimate of the user’s distance and inform about the fares from Google Maps itself.ADVERTISEMENT
Where UI developments are concerned, the Search bar is likely to get a profile picture on the right-hand side and a Google Maps logo on the far-left hand side. The change is likely to be more visually appealing. It is not clear when these developments will be rolled out or if they will be rolled out in the same way as spotted as per reports.
However, since many ride-hailing apps have the option of multiple transport options, Google may collaborate for these developments.
Google Maps recently rolled out features to avoid crowds when using public transits in the backdrop of COVID 19. The aim was to keep users informed about areas affected by Coronavirus. Google Maps would do so by providing users with alerts. These alerts would be from local transit agencies.
Through this feature, users will be able to see if a public transit station is historically more or less busy.

GM still committed to rapid BEV roll-out and will have first driverless model ready within 5 years.
 by Paul A. Eisenstein 
The coming year will see a flood of new battery-electric vehicles rolling into U.S. showrooms, including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Volkswagen ID.4 and the Cadillac Lyriq.
The latter is one of 20 new BEVs General Motors plans to roll out by 2023, but despite the automaker’s goal of reaching “an all-electric future,” CEO and Chairman Mary Barra said it will take decades for that to happen.
“We believe the transition will happen over time,” Barra said during an appearance on Bloomberg Television, cautioning that even by 2040 not every new vehicle will be all-electric “It will happen in a little bit longer period,” she told interviewer David Rubenstein, “but it will happen.”
Among major automakers, GM has announced one of the most aggressive electrification programs. Earlier this year, it showed the automotive news media nearly a dozen different products, ranging from a stretched version of its first long-range model, the Chevrolet Bolt, to an all-electric supercar, the Cadillac Celestiq. There will be battery-powered sedans and both SUV and pickup versions of the GMC Hummer.
GM teased the GMC Hummer during the Super Bowl and later confirmed there will be both pickup and SUV.
“We want to put everyone in an EV,” Barra said.
Despite Barra’s caution about how soon the transition will occur, GM is maintaining plans for 20 separate BEVs by 2023, with a target of reaching 1 million global sales by 2025.
The word, global, is critical, because the GM CEO – like many industry experts – anticipates the U.S. will be relatively slow to embrace electrification, especially when compared to the Chinese and European markets where regulators are pushing hard for the transition to “new-energy vehicles.” Significantly, both China and Germany have taken steps to incentivize such products as they push to revive vehicle demand after the coronavirus pandemic.
If anything, U.S. incentives are set to start phasing out. Tesla lost its tax credits for BEV buyers entirely at the beginning of the year and GM and Nissan’s incentives are phasing out as a result of hitting sales thresholds. The same will happen to numerous other automakers over the next few years as they add models and boost sales.
GM has, nonetheless, remained at least cautiously bullish, betting it can overcome consumer reluctance with new technologies, such as its Ultium batteries, that will lower EV costs and deliver longer range, improved performance and shorter charging times.
GM now plans to focus on its own driverless ride-sharing shuttle operation through San Francisco-based Cruise.
The largest of the U.S. automakers is betting big on new technologies that include not only EVs but AVs, or autonomous vehicles.
Earlier this year, GM’s San Francisco-based subsidiary, Cruise LLC, showed off a prototype of what is expected to be its first driverless model, the Origin. The toaster-shaped shuttle was expected to soon go into a ride-share test program in the Bay Area. What’s unclear is how that project will proceed considering the pandemic which has not only resulted in government restrictions but also raised concerns by consumers about the safety of using ride-sharing and mass transit.
Despite such concerns, Barra said she “clearly” sees GM putting its first autonomous vehicle in production by mid-decade.
“I definitely think it will happen within the next five years,” she said during her Tuesday TV appearance. “Our Cruise team is continuing to develop technology so it’s safer than a human driver. I think you’ll see it clearly within five years.”

 How self-driving vehicles will change Moscow 
By  NATIONAL RESEARCH UNIVERSITY HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS 
In 15 years, the share of self-driving passenger vehicles on Moscow’s roads will exceed 60%. However, this change will not have a significant impact if personal vehicle travel is not reduced and car sharing services are not expanded. For the first time, HSE University researchers have assessed the effects of self-driving cars on the city. In their study, Alexei Zomarev and Maria Rozhenko lay out predictions for 2030 and 2035. https://foresight-journal.hse.ru/en/2020-14-/350698855.htmlScenarios for the Future
In the coming decade, self-driving vehicles will come into wider use. Researchers are looking more and more at not just driverless cars themselves, but at the potential of their shared use–so-called shared autonomous vehicles (SAV).
This potential affects two contemporary services: ride sharing (in which travelers share a vehicle for travel along a similar route) and car sharing (short-term car rental). When self-driving cars begin to be used for these services, these services will become one–minus the driver.
New technology will affect people’s mobility, people’s employment, road safety, the environment, living conditions, and the accessibility of road transport. Taking these factors into account, Alexei Zomarev and Maria Rozhenko created models of how Moscow will look in the near future.
Based on official city strategies and available data regarding the number of passengers per car, auto sales, the efficiency of road networks, and so on, the researchers created four scenarios for 2030 and 2035:
-stagnation
-Shared use
-Robotization
-Absolute Mobility
The scenarios are characterized by different rates of integrating driverless technology into city transport, as well as different possible states of the public vehicle market, including both traditional and self-driving vehicles.
The Stagnation and Robotization scenarios result from a low level of shared service development, while the Absolute Mobility and Shared Use scenarios are characterized by a high level.
The researchers explain their choices of 2030 and 2035 for their model thus: 2022 marks the beginning of the implementation of driverless taxi services, and 2024 is when self-driving cars will be permitted for private use. The years 2030 and 2035 are therefore optimal times for analyzing changes in transport behavior. Moreover, due to poor source data quality, 2035 represents the outer limit for conducting official forecasts.Stagnation and Robotization
The pace at which self-driving vehicles will take over Moscow is different in these scenarios, but the speed at which shared car services become used more widely is equally slow: the fraction of shared vehicles on the road per day is insignificant.
In the Stagnation Scenario, self-driving vehicles in 2030 will amount to about 10% of vehicles on the road, and by 2035 this number will be 34%. In the Robotization Scenario, the share of self-driving cars will increase from 18% in 2030 to 61% in 2035. However, the benefits reaped from driverless technology in these scenarios will not reach their full potential.
Due to weaker technological development, the rate of automobile accidents in the Stagnation Scenario will decrease to a lesser extent than in other scenarios. Most cars in the city will not be self-driving, and the human factor will therefore play a larger role. In the Robotization Scenario, insufficient quality control over autonomous transport–its condition, location, and IT system security–will pose a serious obstacle.
This will increase tension on the roads due to growing congestion. By 2035, according to both scenarios, the number of cars will reach up to 6 million (compared to 4.7 million in 2019), as well as the number of car owners. While there are currently 293 cars per every 1,000 Muscovites, this number will reach up 464 by 2035.
Road congestion will increase by 13%, and time spent by drivers in traffic jams will increase by 5-10%. The shortage of parking spaces will increase by 1.7 million.
While costs per trip will decrease overall, costs will nonetheless go up due to service costs and the prices of more expensive self-driving cars.Absolute Mobility and Shared Use
Unlike the previous scenarios, these scenarios are characterized by a large proportion of shared vehicles. In the Shared Use Scenario, the rate of integration of driverless technology into car sharing is low; sharing services instead rely mainly on human drivers. In the Absolute Mobility Scenario on the other hand, the rate is high: most transport will be carried out by self-driving vehicles, and the effects of car sharing will reach their optimal potential by 2035:
The number of passengers per car will double up to 2.3 passengers;
The average time spent per trip in Moscow will be 55 minutes, which is comparable to the average time spent per trip using a personal vehicle; 
Daily car usage will increase from today’s average of 6 trips per day to almost 14 trips per day;
Up to 32 people will use one SAV per day.
All this will reduce city residents’ need for personal vehicles, save time, and eliminate the need to worry about parking (if parking privileges for shared cars are preserved).
Accessibility to shared services will not be determined by one’s socio-economic status or health, though it will give rise to social tensions as these services reshape the labor market.
Self-driving cars will lead to job losses for 200,000 people, including drivers, couriers, traffic controllers, and traffic police.
The city will breathe easier: the number of cars will be reduced as much as possible–to 1.6 million. Traditional public transport will have fewer passengers, and some routes will be eliminated.
‘Scenarios with a high proportion of shared vehicles will enable a smaller fleet of vehicles to satisfy a greater demand for passenger transportation,’ the study authors conclude. According to their estimates, under the most favorable forecast for 2030, 58% of trips per day will be made in shared vehicles, and by 2035, this number will increase to 77%. These numbers correspond with global estimates of the effects sharing services in megacities
.In Order to Improve Something, Restrict It
Whether or not the scenarios become a reality depends on the measures taken by the authorities to regulate the auto market. The current transport policy, according to the researchers, is inefficient. It gives rise to weakly controlled personal vehicle ownership growth, and if city governments do not put restrictions in place, driverless cars will get stuck in the same traffic jams as those with drivers.
The number of self-driving vehicles should also not be allowed to grow unchecked. However, to stop the degradation of the urban environment, the city should invest in them as well as shared transport. Car-sharing companies should be encouraged to purchase self-driving vehicles, and city residents should be encouraged to forego owning personal vehicles in favor of using shared forms of transport.
In order to achieve this, the researchers propose a comprehensive set of measures, distributed in accordance with each scenario.
For the Shared Use and Absolute Mobility scenarios, both of which are characterized by a high usage of shared vehicles, the number of personal vehicles can be reduced if:
– Car ownership becomes more expensive due to the introduction of a transport tax; 
– Legislation is passed to limit car ownership rights only to those who own or are renting a long-term parking spot that is within walking distance of one’s home. 
To make the Robotization Scenario a reality, it is important to increase the share of self-driving cars. This can be achieved by prohibiting the use of vehicles that are more than 10 years old or by increasing the vehicle tax.
Tax rates can be determined in accordance with the level of a vehicle’s autonomy: the more autonomous it is, the lower the tax. In addition, the introduction of so-called e-pricing–fares for traveling within the city depending on the time of day and travel zone–can help reduce personal vehicle traffic.
Fiscal changes and new requirements for owners of personal vehicles are far from the only thing needed, but these are the changes city residents will feel most.
Initiatives will turn into social costs, including ‘forced changes to transportation behavior models’, increased travel costs, and the need to adapt to new technology.
Therefore, transport policy, among other things, should be proactive. It should anticipate adverse effects and keep citizens as informed as possible. Future benefits need to be clearly justified, and measures should be ‘introduced gradually and announced in advance, several years before the decisions go into effect.’

By John LaConte
 Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley analysts told their clients that Morgan Stanley had grossly underestimated its previous valuation of Google’s driverless car division, Waymo.
“Our previous work has shown how Waymo’s autonomous robotaxi taxi business could be worth (approximately) $75 billion,” a team of analysts led by Brian Nowak noted to investors. “But that is likely just the beginning, as there are two other business models — logistics/delivery and licensing — now coming into view … which we see leading to a total (approximately) $175 billion potential Waymo valuation.”
The $175 billion valuation puts Waymo ahead of GM, Ford and Tesla combined.
In Vail, the Town Council wants to make a priority of thoughtful and thorough discussion of emerging technologies. As reports were coming out about Morgan Stanley’s valuation on Tuesday, Aug. 7, the council listened to a presentation from Rutt Bridges, author of “Our Driverless Future: Heaven or Hell?”
Bridges made some predictions that will affect the United States as a whole, but also localized his presentation to Vail a bit, with insights as to how driverless cars might help affordable housing, cost of living and traffic on Interstate 70.
CAR-TO-CAR COMMUNICATION
Our area will not be among the first to see the driverless car revolution take place. Areas such as Phoenix, San Fransisco and Atlanta have both the predictable weather and high concentrations of people to help reduce the variables in this new experiment.
But while cold and slippery conditions will complicate the driverless scene, it will also offer a chance for companies to employ the car-to-car communication technology that could make these cars so revolutionary, Bridges told the council.
Recounting a conversation he had with a vice president from Volvo, Bridges told the Vail Town Council that a cloud-based “ice map” might make things safer in areas such as ours.
“Whenever their tires slip a little, they’re mapping the areas that are icy, and they’re creating a map in the cloud, so you know where those icy patches are,” Bridges said. “These cars will automatically slow down as they get near them. If that data is shared with everyone, as cars get smarter and smarter, other cars will be able to do that, too.”
Another car-to-car communication breakthrough that could reduce headaches in our area is the idea of vehicles doing something Bridges calls “platooning,” where lines of cars headed in the same direction tailgate one another with very little space between.
“They travel like a school of fish,” Bridges said. “Because these vehicles are all connected electronically by radio waves, when the front vehicle slows down or speeds up, every other one does within a thousandth of a second … you can get the equivalent use of five conventional lanes, if you platoon.”
Bridges sees I-70 as a highway where platooning could reduce traffic immensely.
“I believe this is coming, but there’s a lot more research that needs to be done before it’s really delivered,” he said.
REDUCED COST OF LIVING
Based on projections going out to the year 2027, buying miles from mobility services and ride-share programs currently costs between one fourth and one eighth of what it costs to own a sedan, Bridges estimates.
“The lower your income is, the bigger a difference that makes in your life,” Bridges told the Vail Town Council.
In areas where more housing is being constructed, if parking isn’t taking up a large amount of real estate that could be used for additional units, it’s being done in a way that’s extremely expensive through the use of multi-level parking structures.
“The average parking ratios for a two-bedroom apartment is about 1 1/2 parking spaces,” Bridges said. “A little over half the space that you actually use for the apartment.”
With mobility on demand, cars won’t use conventional parking spaces.
“You park them nose to nose, one behind the other like a Pez dispenser,” Bridges said. “When one is needed, the one in the front pulls off and everybody else moves up.”
Bridges estimates the cost of rent dropping by as much as $375 per month over the course of the next decade if the need for parking is dramatically reduced through the advent of mobility-on-demand and ride-share services.
“The average American car spends 95 percent of its life in park,” he said.

The last-mile commute challenge is faced by delivery services and the everyday commuter alike. Enhancing last-mile commute with IoT can simplify these challenges with the help of connected devices.








Public transportation doesn’t often provide last-mile solutions. People have to look for alternatives to reach their workplace in the morning and when they return home after a long tiring day at work. Research shows that about 143 million Americans, aged 16 and above, commute daily.
 The last mile is a serious issue as it increases the financial costs for commute, causes delays, and increases the time required for commute while also being inconvenient, especially during the rainy seasons or chilly winters. A potential solution to this last-mile challenge can be IoT. IoT is already transforming public transportation and it can be applied to make the last-mile commute even more comfortable.
Connected last-mile commute with IoT
Connected IoT devices can be leveraged to make the daily commutes more comfortable. These solutions also decrease the overall spending on transportation while proving to be an environmental-friendly option.
Connected ride-sharing options
Connected bicycles can prove to be the best IoT solution for the last-mile commute. Companies have already started providing connected bike-sharing options to citizens. Users can track the availability of bikes, usage, and trip details in real-time. This creates a connected community where commuters can plan their travel to be more efficient.

The only hurdle faced by connected bike-sharing services is their integration in today’s vehicular traffic. Governments must ensure that they have dedicated lanes for bike riders so that the traffic flow is smooth.
Connected electric scooters, too, are available for rent at certain locations. Some companies even provide free helmets to users of their electric scooters, albeit at a small shipping cost. These businesses are working towards a better future for our planet by providing alternative commuting options.
Taxi commuting apps are already popular among the current generation. Many commuters are opting for taxi services like Uber and Lyft for their commuting needs instead of a private vehicle. These taxi services provide the option of sharing the vehicle between multiple riders on the same route.
 This is a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly option when compared to single user rides. These companies sit on a ton of data that can be monitored and analyzed to enhance taxi sharing services further. They can work in a way similar to public transportation but provide a complete commute solution to users, unlike most public transport solutions.
IoT solutions are beginning to solve the puzzle of the last mile commute. However, the answer doesn’t lie in the devices but comes from the data that these devices collect. The data collected from these devices need to be shared and analyzed by private players and governments alike to further improve transportation choices for citizens.
 IoT can prove to be the key to find gaps in our current transportation systems and help fill them. Connected cars, taxis, and bikes are here to stay, and will only increase in number with time. We might not only see a future of last-mile commute with IoT but IoT solutions taking care of all our transportation needs in general.

A new congestion pricing policy that begins in Chicago this month is aimed not only at reducing traffic but also moving toward a more equitable, and lower-carbon, transportation system.
In her first State of the City address in August 2019, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she was “exploring revenue options to address rampant congestion that solves the problems of traffic, pollution and other issues.” New fees imposed on ride-hailing services, such as Uber and Lyft, are a part of that strategy.
The new fee structure, which began on Jan. 6, increases fees for trips in the downtown core while lowering rates for shared rides elsewhere in the city and for wheelchair users. Revenues from the fees are projected at $40 million, with $2 million going toward transit projects.
The new fees are based on findings in an October 2019 study produced by the city. The study found that between 2015 and 2018, the number of trips by ride-hailing services more than tripled, with half of rides either beginning or ending downtown, and nearly one-third of rides taking place entirely within the downtown area. The report also found that ride-hailing services had adversely affected transit ridership.
While Chicago’s new fees differ from a London-type congestion pricing scheme — in which drivers must pay a daily fee to drive within a designated charge zone — they do fall under the broad umbrella of congestion pricing, according to Audrey Wennink, transportation director for the Metropolitan Planning Council. Other options include managed lanes, which employ tolls or other restrictions on a specific lane of a road to control the flow of traffic. Parking can also be considered congestion pricing, she added, “depending on how it’s done.”
“It’s kind of like a suite of tools,” she said. “It doesn’t mean one thing.”
Both Lyft and Uber strongly opposed the fees. Each service issued statements claiming that the fees would have a disproportionate effect on low-income residents on the city’s South and West Sides. In its statement, Lyft claimed that the new fees “reduce affordability and reliability while doing nothing to improve mobility.” Uber was even more explicit, stating that the new fees “will take money out of the pockets of riders, who rely on apps to get around, and of drivers — half of whom live in the south and west sides of the city” and “who do not contribute to congestion and lack reliable access to transportation.”
A coalition called Moving Illinois Forward published results of a survey in September 2019 urging a repeal of the new fees. The survey claimed that for a majority of Chicagoans, particularly among the African American and Latinx communities, ride-hailing filled a gap in service created by taxicab drivers who discriminate against riders of color.
However, this claim has been widely disputed. The Center for Neighborhood Technology found that the new fees were more equitable than the previous flat fee structure. Under the new varied fee structure, the cost of trips between neighborhoods would actually decrease.
Lightfoot also received support from a group of transportation and sustainability organizations including the Metropolitan Planning Council, the Center for Neighborhood Technology, the Active Transportation Alliance, the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, the Shared-Use Mobility Center, the University of Illinois at Chicago Department of Urban Planning and Policy, and the Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University. Ride-hailing service Via was also a signatory to an open letter addressed to the mayor.
A legacy of segregation
The South and West Sides of Chicago are geographically larger, yet more sparsely populated than the North Side. These neighborhoods are primarily populated by low-income residents and people of color. There is also less access to public transit, especially rail transit, than in the city’s North Side, which is predominantly white and more affluent.
For example, the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) rail system extends north past the city limits through Evanston to Wilmette, and as far west as Forest Park and Oak Park, both western suburbs. By contrast, the system only extends as far south as 95th Street, miles short of the city limit, which borders with Indiana.
As a result, many residents on the city’s South Side and West Side primarily rely either on buses or cars — including rideshare — to get around. But approximately $2 million of the $40 million projected to be raised by the new fees will be devoted to expanding transit in the region, through projects like the bus priority zone and the proposed Gray Line.
The Bus Priority Zone Program, a joint project by the transit agency and the Chicago Department of Transportation, is designed to relieve congestion and improve service on seven bus lines throughout the city. The first project of the program is the introduction of two bus-only lanes, improved signage and other enhancements along 79th Street — served by one of the highest bus ridership routes in the city.
The Gray Line has been promoted since 1996 by transit advocate Mike Payne. The Gray Line would introduce CTA pricing and service frequency to the existing Metra Electric line, a commuter rail service that runs from downtown Chicago southward.
In recent years, the idea of coordinating Metra and CTA service to provide a service like the Gray Line has gained traction. A coalition of nonprofit and business groups support the idea. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle recently backed a pilot program to introduce lower fares and expanded service on the Metra Electric and Rock Island lines that service the city’s South Side and in the southern suburbs. Lightfoot has expressed reservations about the plan, claiming it would adversely affect CTA ridership. However, the mayor’s office reports that discussions are ongoing.
Thoughtful implementation of congestion pricing, along with devoting at least a portion of revenues raised to enhance transit programs like the bus priority zone and the Gray Line could conceivably create an equitable congestion pricing system in Chicago, according to Wennink.
“The overall goal for all of transportation should be having the most sustainable modes of transportation be attractive choices and work well for people,” she said. “And that’s transit, biking and walking. It’s environmentally sustainable. It’s good for the region, and it’s good for everyone. But you have to make it attractive. You have to make it worthwhile for people. You have to make it available. You have to make the fares reasonable. Policies that we’ve had have favored cars and favored roads, and we need to work in the other direction.”

A short time ago, the auto industry viewed millennials as the lost generation. Automakers expected car sales to plummet and prepared for change. But that didn’t happen. Instead, millennials delayed their adoption of cars until they started getting married, having children and discovering the suburbs.
Simultaneously, the growth of the smart mobility movement with the introduction of rideshare, car share, e-bikes, high-speed rail, scooters and automaker-backed subscription models have transformed how we define transportation. This dramatic change has birthed a mobility culture. The “me” foundation of car culture – where a car takes “me,” how it makes “me” feel about myself and how it represents my values – has been replaced by a “we” perspective.
Allison+Partners’ latest U.S. study called “The Birth of Mobility Culture,” found Generation Z (those under the age of 24) will drive this new culture forward in part due to an inherent comfort with connected technology. Gen Z has grown up hand-in-hand with new technology: it is not scary or intimidating to them and they welcome rapid change as the norm.
The tipping point for mobility innovation won’t be determined by how quickly the technology arrives. The true tipping point will be when Gen Z arrives at a life stage when their consumer spending behaviors (and ability to spend) match values synonymous with mobility culture.
The Allison+Partners study revealed Gen Z consumers view cars more like appliances and nearly 56% agree a car represents essentially no more than a means of transportation. Some 70% of Gen Z consumers do not have their driver’s licenses and 30% of this group has no intention or desire to get one. In fact, Gen Z survey respondents actually ranked alternate reality, VR and smart homes higher in interest than autonomous vehicles.
However, those who make up Gen Z do see autonomous vehicles as an eventual reality. Some 60% of those we surveyed believe they will use autonomous vehicles by 2029.
The implications of these insights are far reaching. We need to immediately rethink how we excite Gen Z consumers about transportation options. Automakers should complement or replace attributes of car coolness, such as horsepower, tow capacity and even fuel economy, with new features such as productivity, shared time, or total experience.
Gen Z has shown an early willingness to invest money and loyalty in brands that demonstrate an ability to align marketing with these new values synonymous with mobility culture. The latest example is in Madrid, with more than 5,000 electric scooters – the largest fleet globally – available for on-demand use as a means to cut down on traffic, noise, emissions pollution, and parking issues. Younger Spaniards flock to these options, with companies increasing the size of the fleet more than fivefold in the past year.
Inverse to this lack of interest in driving comes the acceptance of autonomous technologies. With its high trust level of technology, Gen Z will fuel the adoption of autonomous vehicles.
The combination of autonomous transportation with “we” values core to mobility culture suggests a reimagined way to use time while on the road. In fact, data from Allison+Partners’ The Birth of Mobility Culture report shows nearly half of Gen Z consumers (45.5%) are comfortable with shared ride experiences in an autonomous vehicle.
This new mobility culture also calls into question the commute and opens new options for city planning and commute patterns. Our study found almost two-thirds of Gen Z consumers would be willing to accept a longer commute in a self-driving vehicle. While the single driver commuter experience is generally perceived as bad, unhealthy, and stressful, the “we” commute of mobility culture could be a positive and healthy experience similar to today’s train commutes.
This is where it gets really exciting. The combination of being open to longer commutes and shared experiences allows us to reimagine the urban-to-suburban relationship, broaden access to affordable housing, offer solutions for a work-life balance, and improve relationships with each other.
Case in point: researchers at the UK’s University of East Anglia found British workers who commute to work by bus, train or bicycle were happier compared with those who drive their personal car each day. So, if those who make up Gen Z view cars as little more than appliances, treating a self-driving vehicle experience as a form of alternative transportation might have the same effect.
A new forecast released in June 2019 from the International Data Corporation (IDC) indicated that global spending on smart cities initiatives will reach roughly $190 billion over the next four years.
Three of the top five areas that will experience the most spending by 2023 will include smart grid (given the rise of electric vehicles), advanced public transportation systems, and intelligent traffic management.
The output of these investments made by forward-thinking city planners – cleaner forms of personal vehicle transportation, improved transportation usage and reduced traffic congestion – directly addresses “we” values expressed by emerging mobility consumers.
It may also be easy to forget that less than a decade ago, ridesharing did not even exist. In 2019, Lyft went public with more than $25 billion in market cap, as has Uber with a market cap of just under $80 billion. All despite historically disappointing earnings reports.
Our study found one-third of American consumers report regular use of rideshare services (31%) as an alternative to using their own vehicle – an astounding market penetration for such a relatively young service within the marketplace. And Gen Z is only a relatively small portion of the rideshare market. As they age and enter new life stages, the potential for rideshare service growth is massive. The same is true for all new mobility technologies, which are expected to change massively as autonomous options begin to come to market.
If the dramatic and rapid growth of ridesharing is an indicator, mobility culture will accelerate the transition of how cities and denser suburban areas get designed, particularly space allocated for traditional vehicle parking.
Commercial real estate and larger residential housing are expected to convert existing parking spaces to pick up and drop off areas, solar facilities (to enhance vehicle charging options), or even micro green spaces for local communities which could decrease urban heat-island effects in densely populated areas. Similarly, new construction developments will take these smaller footprint opportunities into consideration.
While streets will continue to play a critical role advancing most mobility options, there will be opportunities to narrow them. A decrease in personal transportation won’t require the wide boulevards seen in many cities today, and those that exist can be converted to accommodate cars, micro-mobility solutions, charging infrastructure, pedestrians, and safer dedicated bikeways.
Developers and city planners will see opportunities to convert larger parking structures into infrastructure that can positively impact urban areas. This will include housing options (condos) to address reported shortages or even indoor growing facilities – with the growth of vertical, indoor growing methods – to bring fresh, affordable produce and healthy food options to communities.
The birth of mobility culture and the rise of “we” values suggest future journeys will not be quiet and alone, but ambient rides that are shared with others.

While we’re all trying to do everything we can to keep ourselves and our community safe during the coronavirus, sometimes it’s really hard to know what’s fine and what’s not.
For example: running outside? That’s ok. Getting your nails done? Hmm, maybe not. But what about catching an Uber?
Health organisations are recommending people stay indoors when possible, but some people still have to go to work, go to the grocery store, or run errands for vulnerable family members. The government has warned against using public transport, so for some, ride-share apps are the best option.
Most companies, like Uber, Ola, and DiDi have introduced measures to help keep passengers safe. But at the end of the day, it’s up to you to be responsible for your own health. Wash or sanitise your hands before and after being in a ride-share car, and sit in the back seat instead of the front in order to minimise contact with your driver. It’s probably best to avoid Uber Pool or other multi-person rides.
Uber is urging any drivers who feel unwell to remove themselves from the app. They’re also working to provide drivers with disinfectant and cleaning supplies to ensure their cars meet a high level of cleanliness to keep riders safe. They’ve also encouraged UberEats drivers to leave food deliveries on peoples’ doorsteps, rather than handing them over face to face.
Relatively new ride-share app DiDi has introduced a feature to help support drivers who might be struggling with the lower income associated with fewer passengers out in public. From Monday, drivers will receive 95 per cent of every fare they complete, with the company only taking a five per cent cut.
For comparison, Uber drivers in Australia usually receive about three-quarters of their fares, with the company taking 27.5 per cent.
DiDi also pledged $10 million USD to aid drivers who test positive for COVID-19 or are forced to self-isolate by official organisations. They will provide drivers with a one-off payment to help them cover living costs while unable to work.
Uber has announced a similar initiative in Australia, giving financial assistance to any existing Uber drivers who are unable to work due to quarantine or self-isolation reasons.
Ride-share companies are doing their bit to ensure you stay healthy if you need to use their service. So long as you keep yourself clean and take necessary precautions, you can keep using the apps without any worry.

Uber and Lyft have finally come clean: Their vehicles are causing a big share of the congestion in several American cities.
A new study jointly commissioned by the two app-based cab companies found that they have a massive footprint in San Francisco, Washington and Boston, but the companies are affecting traffic to a lesser degree in Chicago, Seattle, and Los Angeles, where private car ownership is much higher.
Both companies have experienced explosive growth in the past decade but haven’t acknowledged how much congestion they’ve caused in America’s cities — until now.
Transportation consultants Fehr & Peers compared miles traveled for ride share companies as well as private and commercial vehicles in six cities over the course of one month: September 2018. The analysis is a “high-level exercise” that help both companies understand how they contribute to congestion and “help them form appropriate narratives for both internal and external communication,” the study noted.
In other words, admit their role in jamming traffic in cities, conveniently blame household car ownership and commercial trucking for clogging most roadways, and eventually pivot to advocate for congestion pricing in other cities.
“At Uber, we’re focused on reducing the need for private car ownership while expanding transportation access for all,” the company’s Head of Global Policy for Public Transportation Chris Pangilinan wrote in a Medium post that accompanied the study. “As we continue to grow in the communities we serve, it’s important to understand how roads are being used so we can continue to work together with cities to develop the right policies that expand mobility.
Uber and Lyft are largely correct that private cars and commercial trucks, buses, and vans made up the vast majority of vehicle miles traveled in major metro areas where they have a presence. Ride share companies accounted for only one to three percent of traffic — the rest of the VMTs were made by private car drivers — but the results varied far more dramatically in each area’s urban core:
In San Francisco, 12.8 percent of total vehicle miles traveled were made in an Uber or Lyft.

In Boston, it was 7.7 percent.
In Washington, 6.9 percent.
In Chicago, 3.3 percent.
In L.A., 2.6 percent
In Seattle, 1.9 percent.

San Francisco, Boston, and Washington had a larger share of ride share vehicles than the other cities because they are “denser and more compact and contain less suburban, rural, and exurban land area,” the study said.
New York was not included in the six-city study because its transit system is so much larger than other cities in the rest of the country and car ownership remains comparatively low. Other studies have shown the crippling effects of ride share vehicles on Manhattan traffic — which led the New York State Legislature to adopt a congestion pricing surcharge on vehicles entering Manhattan’s central business district earlier this year.
But the study leaves out a lot of information, too. It doesn’t address Uber and Lyft’s effects on traffic over time or how many trips ride share companies take from public transit.
And while both companies have zealously guarded their ridership data, other traffic analysts have sought to provide a clearer view of their influence.
For instance, Schaller Consulting found in 2018 that private ride share vehicles accounted for a 180-percent increase in driving on city streets and that 60 percent of ride share users would have taken public transit or walked or biked if the vehicles weren’t available to them. And another independent study earlier this year found that ride hail companies made up more than half of San Francisco’s 62-percent jump in weekday traffic delays between 2010 and 2016.
CityLab reported that the companies, which have since gone public this spring, are being more transparent because they are looking to shape the public debate over congestion pricing. That could lead to more people choosing Uber and Lyft rides instead of commuting to work or driving into the city for a concert or a game in their own vehicles.
Uber and Lyft’s strategy for the future will be to acknowledge a role in creating more traffic in downtown areas, with plenty of supporting evidence, while vociferously blaming congestion on commercial trucks and families who choose to drive their own car over taking transit.
“The research shows that despite tremendous growth over the past decade, [Uber and Lyft] use still pales in comparison to all other traffic, and although [Uber and Lyft] are likely contributing to an increase in congestion, its scale is dwarfed by that of private cars and commercial traffic,” Pangilinan wrote in his Medium post.

Your mother probably told you never to get in a car with a stranger. The multibillion-dollar global ride-hailing industry depends on your ignoring her. If they want to earn that trust, though, companies need to rethink the trade-off they’ve long made between safety and cost.
Around the world, passengers are now hailing more than 10.5-billion rides a year. Not surprisingly, some have ended in tragedy. Uber came under fire in India after a 26-year-old woman was raped by one of its drivers in 2014, and local rival Ola has faced a similar backlash. In the US, Lyft has been sued by multiple women who say drivers sexually assaulted them.
In 2018, within the span of three months, two female passengers were murdered by drivers of China’s ride-sharing company, Didi Chuxing. Didi’s Hitch car-pooling service was once marketed almost as a cross between Uber and Tinder: a taxi service that let drivers and passengers rate each other by appearance. Didi halted Hitch in August 2018 after an outpouring of anger from state media, regulators and China’s version of the #DeleteUber movement.
Last week, Didi announced plans to restart Hitch on a trial basis in seven Chinese cities by the end of November. The decision follows a “comprehensive safety review and product revamp”, as well as the introduction of a new women’s safety programme that includes better “risk analysis” and an updated in-app security assistant. Didi plans to spend 2-billion yuan (R4.2bn) on safety measures in 2019, including more frequent use of facial-recognition technology — to ensure drivers are who they say they are — and a deeper review of abnormal driving patterns, as well as more regular safety tests for drivers.






But the key to the Hitch relaunch are new restrictions on the programme. The service will be limited to trips under 50km and women can only ride between 5am and 8pm. By contrast, men can keep riding until 11pm.
While the company’s intentions are good, this is no solution. A sophisticated analysis of high-risk scenarios won’t help you if you’re stuck in the back seat within an inch of your life. And to assume that a woman will only be raped and murdered between 8pm and 5am more than 50km from her pick-up point seems a bit naïve.
What the ride-hailing industry in China and elsewhere really needs to do is re-examine who’s allowed to drive in the first place. It’s hard to say whether the measures Didi is now implementing would have screened out Zhong Yuan, the 28-year-old Hitch driver who was executed in August for murdering his 20-year-old passenger. After passing background checks and providing documentation, you can still become a Didi driver in 10 days or less.
Instead, companies should be raising the barriers to entry so they’re hiring fewer, better drivers. And if they won’t, governments should step in. In Malaysia, regulators now require aspiring drivers to pass written exams and health checks, and to register for specific permits. About a third of applicants have failed the exam thus far, transport minister Anthony Loke said in October, and more than 20% of Grab drivers have reportedly quit to avoid complying with the stricter regulations.
Singapore imposed new rules earlier in 2019 to bring ride-hailing companies closer in line with taxi operators. The regulations were proposed less than a week after my Bloomberg News colleague Yoolim Lee wrote about a Grab accident that left her with a broken neck and at risk of stroke. She estimated that, around the time of the incident, nearly half of private-hire drivers in the city didn’t have the proper licence and shouldn’t have been driving. While fewer drivers doesn’t necessarily mean safer drivers, a steeper commitment at least means they have a lot more at stake to protect their livelihoods.
The genius of the gig economy is the ability to make money from underutilised, ubiquitous skills. Yet the model may have been taken too far. Just because you can make an omelette doesn’t mean you should run a diner. So why should you drive professionally just because you have a licence?
Shrinking the supply of drivers will obviously make rides more expensive. But it’s worth judging the prospect of higher prices against the long cycle of the internet economy. The internet has made everything from academic research to air travel cheaper and easier to access. At the same time, quality goods and services can’t be free forever: we’ve seen this in the news business, where websites that once offered unfettered access to their journalism (including Bloomberg) have implemented paywalls. If fewer drivers means safer rides, that’s a price most people should be willing to pay.

Commuting these days isn’t what it used to be. Instead of trying to draw workers into Boston, some Massachusetts businesses are often trying to get their most coveted employees to leave the city — at least for the work day.
Creating solutions to the so-called “first mile/last mile problem” helps make that possible. It means providing a way for workers to both get to the train — the first mile — and then how to get them to work — the last mile.
This is true in many parts of the state, but especially in the fast-growing region west of Boston.Paul Matthews is the executive director of the 495/Metrowest Partnership, a coalition of 35 communities from Westford to Foxboro. For years, he and others have been trying to make the commuter rail work, not only for businesses in Boston, but also the other way around — for the growing industries along Route 495. But Matthews said to make the train truly viable, you must get people from train stations to their workplaces.
“This is New England,” Matthews said. “You can’t get off the train in January and walk 2.5 miles to your place of work. You need a way of stepping onto a shuttle and getting there.”That shuttle most often takes the form of a van seating up to 16 people. But providing those shuttles to the almost 200,000 people working in MetroWest but living elsewhere is requiring people to get creative.
Doug Halley is the transportation coordinator for the town of Acton and for the CrossTown Connect Transportation Management Association, an effort funded by seven Massachusetts towns trying to get commuters out of their cars. Halley said they provide door-to-door service for seniors and for those with physical disabilities, and do commuter shuttles for area businesses. The shuttles drive local residents to the commuter rail so they can work in Boston, and bring workers coming in from Cambridge and Boston to work at companies along Route 495.
Halley thinks the MBTA could do a lot more to promote what’s called “reverse commuting” by lowering, or even eliminating, outbound fares.“The trains are virtually empty,” Halley said. “Why even worry about charging those people coming out? Once they establish the ridership base, they can start increasing those fares, but initially they should be encouraging people to come out here. The businesses out here need them.“In some cases, the employees need the shuttles as well. Peter Lowitt, who manages economic development for the office park at Fort Devens in central Mass., said many of the 130 reverse commuters at Devens depend on the commuter rail and the shuttle.
“In many cases, but for the shuttle bus, those folks wouldn’t be employed,” Lowitt said. “I was speaking with a gal who commutes out from Cambridge and she said she wouldn’t have taken the job if the commuter rail wasn’t here.”
MBTA officials have acknowledged they haven’t done enough to promote reverse commuting, but are now talking about testing reduced fares for reverse commuters — though not on all rail lines, and not on the Fitchburg train that serves Devens.
The state is also pledging to give more support to the shuttle van programs as a way to solve the first mile/last mile problems. Earlier this month, the MassDOT announced it would give $1.5 million to organizations like CrossTown Connect that can come up with creative solutions.An example is the Maynard/Acton Commuter Shuttle, which connects people to the South Acton Train Station two and a half miles outside of town. It also transports workers coming in from Boston to their jobs in Maynard. Usage of the shuttle has grown in three years, from 100 rides per month up to 800.
The commuter shuttles that run in Maynard, Acton, Littleton and four other nearby towns are examples of the kinds of collaborative approaches that Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack says the state is looking to fund.
“The reason people aren’t trying other ways of commuting to work and driving by themselves is not lack of information. It’s actually lack of services,” Pollack said at a recent transportation conference.Some advocates think the state could be doing more to promote these first mile/last mile services, like shuttles. Once people learn the shuttles are there and start using them, they keep using them. And as ridership grows, it means more people are getting to and from work without using their cars.That fulfills what Pollack says is today’s transportation imperative: “To move more people in fewer vehicles.”

Disclaimer: I’m a product manager at Uber. This piece represents my views only, and not those of people working on behalf of Uber.
A wave of electric scooters and bikes has been taking over American cities in the past year. People have been dismissing them as toys (which alone should tickle your interest) or a fad. But there’s a lot more to them than that, and I’d go as far as to say that I’m more excited about the potential 20 years impact of micromobility on cities than I am about that of self-driving cars.
Like autonomous vehicles, electric bikes and scooters are an order of magnitude cleaner and safer than human-driven cars. But unlike self-driving cars, they also bring order of magnitude improvements in space and energy efficiency, on top of being very cheap. And we can deploy them today.
Any single one of these improvements would be a game changer in and of itself, the kind that car companies would spend billions to pursue. Bundled together, they’re an innovation like we see only once a century.
1. Cleaner and more energy efficient
I hope we agree that global warming is a Really Big Deal — probably the one biggest issue we’re facing as a civilization. I’m not saying that scooters are a silver bullet for it. But they’re a big part of the solution. Transportation represents 28% of greenhouse gas emissions, and micromobility can shave a big chunk off of that by eating the sub-2 miles trips making up 40% of urban rides (source).
The reason, in short, is that these new modes are electric and super lightweight. Internal combustion engines are only 35% efficient, losing the rest in heat. Then, only 5% of that energy go into moving the passenger — the other 95% move the car.
So, the overall efficiency of a car is 0.05 * 0.35 = 1.75%. This means that for every gallon you pour into your tank, only 2 ounces are used to move you. The rest is either lost in heat or used to move your car.
Compare that to electric scooters, which convert 85% of their energy into movement and weigh around 30lbs, making their overall energy efficiency over 70%.
Again, car companies would kill to improve their cars’ efficiency by 10%. Here, we’re talking of a 4000% improvement.
2. More space efficient
You may have seen these images highlighting the abysmal space-inefficiency of cars.

This is how much space 60 people take when they drive, walk, bike, or ride a bus.
This is what I find hilarious in people complaining about scooters “taking too much space.” It’s a typical case of what Bastiat calls “The Seen and the Unseen.” You see the space the scooter takes, but not that saved by replacing a car. If you care about space, you should love bikes and scooters.
I know, scooters are sometimes in the middle of the sidewalk, and cars aren’t. But that’s easily solvable by building more bike racks and dedicated parking spaces, which cities are starting to do.
These new vehicles don’t save space only by being smaller. They also allow riders to keep a shorter safety distance between each other. By some estimates, these 2 factors combined result in traffic bandwidth that’s up to 10x greater.






This makes micromobility the one most compelling solution to our traffic problems. And to illustrate how big of a problem it is: a 2015 study by the Texas A&M Transportation institute and INRIX finds that (emphasis mine)







In 2014, congestion caused urban Americans to travel an extra 6.9 billion hoursand purchase an extra 3.1 billion gallons of fuel for a congestion cost of $160 billion.

To put these numbers in perspective:

6.9 billion hours is roughly 9,000 lives, or the equivalent of three 9/11s per year
$160 billion is 0.8% of the American GDP
3.1 billion gallons are 2.1% of the country’s yearly fuel consumption

I may already have said it, but this is a very big deal. Solving this traffic problem alone is worth investing dozens of billions of dollars. Talking about micromobility, you find yourself mentioning this kind of perk just in passing, as one of your 5 bullet points.
3. Safer
Now, I know this one may be a bit contentious — I too read the articles about bike fatalities. But here’s how I see the situation: someone’s riding their bike, a car kills them, and people view the bike as the problem.
I brought together this very scientific table to describe the real problem.

If we reserved a whole neighborhood to bikes only, or just built a lot of bike lanes in it, I guarantee the accidents rate would go way down. In fact, The Netherlands ran the experiment. Can you guess from the chart below when it started building bike lanes everywhere?
 
Source: Statistics Netherlands
Yes, the early 70s, after which road fatalities decreased from 3500+ in 1971 (including 400+ children) to 640 in 2010 (including 12 children). That’s a reduction of 82% in overall fatalities and of 97% in children fatalities (children are overrepresented in road fatalities since drivers can’t see them).
This is why I think that accelerating the adoption of micromobility is more than an exciting business opportunity — it’s a moral imperative. If we can save dozens of thousands of lives every year just by building a ton of bike lanes, what are we waiting for?
4. Making the world city a better place
I know it’s become cliché in Silicon Valley to say that you’re #ChangingTheWorld. I think one big reason why people roll their eyes when they hear this is that it’s often said by companies working in the “world of bits.” Not that there’s anything wrong with these businesses, I do believe they’re impactful. But they remain these abstract entities “in the cloud,” pictures behind the glass in your pocket.
Transportation companies are different. They’re actually deeply rooted in the real world — in atoms.
If you tell me you’ll change the world, and then you give me a better compression algorithm, I’ll be like “yeah I kinda see it if I squint really hard.” But I won’t need to squint if you tell me you’ll change the world, and then you go on to save thousands of lives per year; give back to everyone the hours per week they’d have spent in traffic; decrease greenhouse gas emissions by a double-digit percent; and turn American cities into, like, utopian Smurf villages.
(In general, I do believe innovation in the world of bits is overrated, and innovation in the world of atoms underrated. But that’s for another essay.)
And to illustrate the depth of the impact I’m talking about; behold these comparisons of the same Danish streets, before and after they reserved them to bikes and pedestrians. That’s what changing the world looks like — in less than 30 years.
Historical pictures from the Amsterdam Archives. Recent ones by Thomas Schlipjer.
These changes are not just aesthetic. They also have a deep impact on local economies — increasing footfall and the revenue of local businesses. This in turn also translates in higher real estate value in these neighborhoods.
(To read more about the impact of micromobility on local economies, check out Lawlor 2014’s “The business case for better streets and places”.)
This impact makes intuitive sense. Cities are about communities. And cars are about isolating you and putting you in your own bubble. Innovation in the car industry consists in making this bubble as thick as possible: better noise isolation, better suspensions, better speakers…
Micromobility vehicles are the contrary. When you ride a scooter, you’re not isolated — you’re in the city. Driving a car is boring — that’s why we’re trying to automate it. Riding a bike is fun — even more so when it’s electric! (It’s hard to convey this to people who’ve never tried it, but the experience of riding a pedal-assist bike truly is exhilarating.)
I find it funny that Americans visit Europe and extol its charming, lively streets, and then go back home to build the same sprawling suburbs where one needs to drive just to go grab breakfast.
This is one common thing disappointing tourists in the US. They expect to see a big metropolis with skyscrapers everywhere, shops open 24/7, and tons of life in the streets. When they arrive, they rapidly find out that there isn’t much Manhattan in the US, apart from, well, Manhattan.
Go to Houston, Denver or Salt Lake City — even their city centers during week-ends are mostly dead. My favorite example of all is Los Angeles, which in John Lennon’s words is just a “parking lot where you can buy a hamburger for the trip to San Francisco.”
Going around American cities as a pedestrian, one feels like a second-class citizen. The cities were visibly designed for cars, with pedestrians a mere afterthought — when they’re lucky to be a thought at all. The absence of visual diversity makes walking boring, of any shade structure unhealthy, and of places to seat painfully clear that one is not supposed to hang around for too long, like giant signs saying “move along, nothing to see!”
Cities used to be living places. Cars turned most of them into dead spaces instead, with tiny islands of life here and there. I find it unbelievable that we’ve come to see this as the only possible option, and exhilarating to contribute in changing this.
5. Micromobility as a force for economic inclusion
People need transportation options to access earning opportunities, mainly located in unaffordable cities. Today, the cheapest option is public transportation. But there remains a “last mile” problem: how is one to access the nearest station when it’s sometimes miles away? Solving this will need an option with much greater traffic density than public transportation, at a much lower price than cars. Micromobility fits the bill perfectly.
This must be why these new modes of transportation are so overwhelmingly popular amongst lower income groups, as suggested by this survey of 7,000 people by Populus Group in their report on micromobility.


“It’ll never work in America”
When I make these points, people often tell me that that’s all well and good, but could never happen in the US. “American cities were just designed around cars — we’d have to rebuild the whole country to change this!”
But cities like Amsterdam, too, were re-designed for cars in the first half of the 20th Century, leading to a sharp increase in road fatalities and decrease in bike ridership.
This engendered the fierce activism of the “Stop the Child Murder” movement in the 1970s (“Stop Der Kindermoor”). People took the streets, blocked wide arteries with bicycles, and pressured politicians to build more bike lanes.
Politicians eventually folded, and the impact was significant. Bike ridership nearly doubled in just a couple of years, showing that the reason why people stopped biking was not that they didn’t want to (even in a country with as cold and wet a weather as The Netherlands). It’s just that we wouldn’t let them.
It did not take rebuilding the whole city — just building bike lanes, lots and lots of bike lanes. Neither did it take decades for it to start bearing fruits — just a couple of years.
There is no reason why the same change could not happen in the US. The capital is there. The talent is there. And the capacity for change is there. Look at how fast gay marriage became legal — from 0 states supporting it in 2001 to all 50 of them in 2013. Or look at marijuana, which may be getting legal even faster.
If you’d asked people in 2000, who would have thought that these two things would have happened so quickly? I know I wouldn’t. And I think the US will surprise us again, this time in how quickly and drastically it’s going to reshape its cities in the next 20 years.

If you’ve ridden light rail in the Rainier Valley in the past few months you’ve no doubt seen them: black vans with a blue Seattle skyline painted on the sides.
Called Via to Transit, the vans look like they could be an Uber spinoff. In fact, passengers dial up the rides through an app similar to any ride hailing service. But as the King County Metro Transit logo emblazoned on the door indicates, the vans are part of a county-run experiment with on-demand “microtransit.”






Launched in April, the service connects transit riders with light rail and bus lines. Southeast Seattle has little east-west bus service, which makes it difficult for people to reach the north-south-running light rail line by bus.
“We’re making it easier for people to access light rail and our buses,” said Casey Gifford, Metro’s Via project manager. “It is also about broadening access to [ride hailing] for populations that haven’t generally been able to access them.”
Via is a private company contracted by Metro to provide the vans, drivers and technology. The $3.2 million, year-long operation is funded by $2.7 million from Seattle’s transportation benefits district levy, a $350,000 Federal Transit Administration grant and $100,000 each from Metro and Sound Transit. Four months into the pilot project, Metro has collected enough data to get a sense of whether the subsidized rideshare is working.
It’s far too early for the agency to declare victory, but so far, the service has exceeded Metro’s daily ridership goals and served up more than 70,000 total rides.
Via users order a ride through the app or by calling a service center at 206-258-7739. Users connect with a driver and are usually directed to walk a few blocks for pickup. All rides on Via have the potential to be shared rides, similar to UberPool or Lyft Shared, so the app tries to route the driver on the straightest line between pickups and final destinations.
Rides cost the same as taking the bus: $2.75 for adults, $1.50 for low-income riders with ORCA Lift cards. Rides are paid for with ORCA cards or the Transit GO Ticket app. Users can also preload ORCA cards in advance with cash — an effort to increase access for people without smartphones and banks — but the drivers cannot accept cash. Via has 18 vans in its fleet, some of which are wheelchair accessible.
The service is available in the Rainier Valley in neighborhoods surrounding the Mount Baker, Columbia City, Othello and Rainier Beach rail stations, as well is in Tukwila near the Tukwila International Boulevard station. To keep the trips short, rides must take place within a relatively small service area; the Columbia City service area for example is about 2 square miles stretching between Beacon Hill, Lake Washington and Dakota and Orcas streets.
So, are people taking advantage of an opportunity for low-cost ride hailing? More than expected, said Metro’s Gifford. According to her, the goal was to average 525 rides per day. Instead Via averages 770 rides a day, with 1,000 rides on the busiest days.
That puts Via’s ridership on par with bus routes designed to ensure an area has at least some transit coverage. The 121 route from Burien to downtown Seattle averages 900 rides a day, in the ballpark with Via’s initial ridership.
About 30 percent of Via’s ridership so far has been reduced-fare rides. Gifford could not provide data about the number of rides that have been carpool rides versus solo rides. Just over 200 wheelchair users have taken Via rides.
According to Metro, Via’s cost per ride to the operator is about $10. Compared to Metro’s systemwide cost per boarding of $4.92, that’s expensive. But high ridership bus routes have a lower cost per boarding than low ridership routes, meaning Via’s costs are not wildly out of line with costs associated with low-rider routes.
Metro’s Gifford explained that unlike Uber and Lyft drivers who are paid per ride, Via drivers are paid an hourly wage. The agency’s contract with Via stipulates a base wage of $15 an hour, with a higher rate paid at rush hour and for driving wheelchair users. Via driver wages are lower than the union Metro driver scale.
“Is this cost reasonable mostly because we’re relying on lower-wage labor?” asked Katie Wilson, general secretary of the Transit Riders Union, an advocacy group. “So it’s a question of how far do we want to go down that road.”
Providing people better access to transit is the goal of the program and one end of the trip must be to or from the light rail station within the service area. People could theoretically use Via to get to the grocery store, a friend’s house or to work, if it was close to the light rail station, however.
That doesn’t appear to be happening much. Gifford said ORCA card data shows more than 90 percent of Via riders transfer to and from light rail. Metro is just beginning to conduct rider surveys to find out whether Via is creating new transit riders, whether people are replacing car trips to the light rail station or simply giving up and replacing slower bus rides.
Hester Serebrin, policy director with the advocacy nonprofit Transportation Choices Coalition, said she’s excited about the data Metro might glean from Via showing where and when people need better transportation, but hopes that contracted, on-demand van service isn’t a permanent fixture.
“We see this as an interim solution,” Serebrin said. “But fixed-route, publicly owned transit is the ultimate solution. We want to be able to expand King County Metro service and make sure their buses are reliable, fast, affordable.”
Ben Fried, communications director at the New York-based transportation research nonprofit TransitCenter, similarly thinks a service like Via can’t be a replacement for good bus service, but can potentially be a substitute for something like Access paratransit — Metro’s on-demand service for people with mental or physical disabilities who can’t otherwise ride transit.
“A good way of thinking about microtransit is it can be a slightly more efficient paratransit-type service,” he explained. “But it can’t be a substitute for fixed-route service. It just doesn’t scale up the way a bus does.”
Metro operates two similar programs: one to connect people on the Eastside to the Eastgate Park and Ride and another to connect West Seattleites from the California-Alaska Junction to the Alki water taxi. Via also operates in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere. Some places, such as Pinellas County, Florida, offer residents subsidized Uber and Lyft rides to connect to bus stops.
Kansas City ran a famously unsuccessful pilot project in partnership with the now-defunct microtransit service Bridj. Over the course of the yearlong, $1.5 million pilot, people took just 1,480 rides. That means the city subsidized the service to the tune of $1,000 per ride.
Fried doesn’t see Via boosting light rail ridership. Microtransit, he said, can complement public transit in situations where people might not be able otherwise to get to a train station. But it is not a comprehensive solution to the “last-mile problem.”
“It would be a mistake for transit agencies and cities to rely on this kind of last-mile connection to the exclusion of making better walking and biking connections to transit hubs,” he said. “Those are also very low-cost ways to make it easier to connect to transit.”
Gifford said she sees a place for Via-type services in the agency’s future.
“Metro’s becoming a mobility agency,” she said. “It means that we’re trying to do what we do best,  which is providing really great high-capacity fixed route transit and working with communities to complement that fixed route service with a range of other options that fit that community.”
Gifford said it will be evaluated by a number of metrics to decide whether it’s worth continuing past the first year or expanding.
“We’ll look at ridership surveys, feedback, focus groups,” Gifford said. “We’ll look at whether it’s changing people’s travel behavior, who’s benefiting … how we are achieving equity and accessibility for these populations.”
The Via pilot project will run through mid-April of next year. The agency will decide in early 2020 if it will continue as a permanent program.
Correction: This story has been updated to clarify that one end of a Via trip must be to or from a light rail station. A previous version of the story said trips could be to and from anywhere in the service area.

Hyundai has become the first car manufacturer to buy into Uber’s dream of fleets of flying taxis flitting above the cities of the world with the unveiling of its first concept at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
Uber and Hyundai Motor Company announced a new partnership to develop Uber Air Taxis for a future aerial ride share network at the show, along with the new full-scale aircraft concept – the S-A1.
According to the two companies, Hyundai will produce and deploy the air vehicles, while Uber will provide airspace support services, connections to ground transportation, and customer interfaces through an aerial ride share network. Both parties are collaborating on infrastructure concepts to support take-off and landing for this new class of vehicles.
“Our vision of Urban Air Mobility will transform the concept of urban transportation,” said Jaiwon Shin, Executive Vice President and Head of Hyundai’s Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Division.
“We expect UAM to vitalise urban communities and provide more quality time to people. We are confident that Uber Elevate is the right partner to make this innovative product readily available to as many customers as possible.”
The S-A1 is designed for a cruising speed up to 290 km/h, a cruising altitude of around 300 to 600 metres above ground, and to fly trips up to 100 km. It will be 100 per cent electric and Hyundai says that during peak hours will require about five to seven minutes for recharging.
It uses “distributed electric propulsion”, powering multiple rotors and propellers around the airframe that it says increases safety by decreasing any single point of failure. Having several, smaller rotors also reduces noise relative to large rotor helicopters with combustion engines, which is obviously rather important in  cities.
The S-A1 is designed to take off vertically, transition to wing-borne lift in cruise, and then transition back to vertical flight to land. The cabin is designed with four passenger seats, allowing riders to board and disembark easily and avoid the dreaded middle seat with enough space for a personal bag or backpack. Hyundai says it will be piloted initially, but over time they will become autonomous.
“Hyundai is our first vehicle partner with experience of manufacturing passenger cars on a global scale,” said Eric Allison, head of Uber Elevate.
“We believe Hyundai has the potential to build Uber Air vehicles at rates unseen in the current aerospace industry, producing high quality, reliable aircraft at high volumes to drive down passenger costs per trip. Combining Hyundai’s manufacturing muscle with Uber’s technology platform represents a giant leap forward for launching a vibrant air taxi network in the coming years,” 
Bloomberg has reported that, while Uber has held talks with the US Federal Aviation Administration, the whole flying taxi thing is likely to face heavy scrutiny from the regulator over logistics for takeoff and landing, noise and safety concerns.
And that is not even getting into the whole autonomous thing, although neither Hyundai nor Uber have provided a timeline for dispensing with human pilots.

The Indian shared mobility market was valued at $630.7 million in 2018, which is projected to reach $3,466.7 million by 2024, witnessing a CAGR of 27.6% during the forecast period (2019–2024). Among service types, ride hailing service dominated the market during the historical period.
Whereas, during the forecast period, the Indian shared mobility market is expected to witness the fastest growth in the two-wheeler sharing category, owing to its easy availability, time/route flexibility, and affordability (marginal premium for travel with respect to other forms of shared mobility).
The Indian shared mobility market is experiencing substantial amount of investments from major global investors. For instance, in June 2019, a scooter rental company, WickedRide Adventure Services Pvt. Ltd. (Bounce) received an investment of $72.0 million in a fresh funding round, which was led by B Capital Group and Falcon Edge Capital. With this fund, the company looks to expand out of Bengaluru into ten new cities in the coming years. Additionally, with this expansion, the company has planned to add 100,000 more scooters in its fleet in next 12–18 months, with a focus on electric scooters.
Owning a private vehicle demands a high investment, which mainly comprises vehicle cost, fuel cost, parking expense, maintenance charge, and insurance cost. In this regard, shared mobility allows user to enjoy the facilities of owning a personal vehicle, without having the need to actually own it. 
The users can make the payments on the basis of their usage only. Besides, shared mobility is extremely convenient for general public, primarily daily commuters, as they can enjoy driving to their required destination without having the hassles of owning and maintaining their own vehicles. Additionally, the users can easily access to the services by booking the vehicles, directly through the companies’ mobile applications. Thus, the cost-effectiveness and convenience of shared mobility facilitates the growth of the Indian shared mobility market.
Geographical Analysis of India Shared Mobility Market
The south region held the largest share in the Indian shared mobility market in 2018, primarily due to the fact that the majority of shared mobility service providers are present in cities in south India, including Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Visakhapatnam. Additionally, the growing demand for car hailing and rental services is boosting the market growth in the region. Whereas, the north region is the second-largest revenue generator in the market, owing to the high demand for shared mobility services among people, primarily for meeting daily commuting and outstation travel needs.
Competitive Landscape of India Shared Mobility Market
The Indian shared mobility market is consolidated in nature, with the top two players, namely, ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and Uber Technologies Inc. accounted for more than 60% of the market share in 2018. ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Ola) was the market leader 2018, which was followed by Uber Technologies Inc. (Uber), holding the second spot in the market.
Some of the other major players operating in the Indian shared mobility market include Zoomcar India Pvt. Ltd., Drivezy India Travels Pvt. Ltd., Carzonrent India Pvt. Ltd., Vogo Automotive Pvt.

 After being chosen by the cities of Copenhagen and Rotterdam, the urban mobility solution engineered by MERMEC is ready to show up on the market 

Vaimoo, is the Vehicle Sharing system designed to revolutionise the current urban mobility scenario. Engineered by the Connected Vehicle & Micro-Mobility Business Unit of MERMEC, the Italian multinational company known as a pioneering developer of high-tech digital solutions for railway and rapid transits for over 30 years, VAIMOO will be present at MOVE, one of the most important mobility events in the world, which will take place on February, 11-12 2020 in London. 
During the two days, at the booth 15B, Vaimoo will show to the market the innovation and potentiality of the flexible and multi-vehicle platform, which uses the power of IoT technologies to deliver more efficient, safe and user-friendly smart mobility services. 
Moreover, VAIMOO will put together the best experience in the e-mobility field to the round table “Sustainable Micro-mobility: taking the field with BIKESHARE DANMARK, TIER and KOLUMBUS”, which will take place on February 11th (12:40 pm). 
At the round table, with Vaimoo, will be present the representatives of the most important companies in the sector, who will discuss the major issues in the world of e-mobility, outlining the best practices to offer efficient services designed for the smart cities of the future. On stage with Marco Pesani, Head of Product Management at MERMEC (VAIMOO), there will be: Peter Vest, Chief Operating Officer at Bikeshare Danmark, Espen Strand Henriksen, Mobility Developer at Kolumbus, Matthias Wilrich, Vice President Sourcing and Supply Chain at Tier Mobility. 
At 4.30 p.m. it will be the turn of Matteo Pertosa, Board Of Directors at MERMEC (VAIMOO), who will speak at the round table “Electric Micro-mobility: the affordable and flexible solution for last-mile transportationˮ. 
THE MODEL OF VAIMOO 
Electric micro-mobility is one of the most powerful enhancer of Last-mile travel, nowadays a key element in the growth of public transport, providing the capillarity, flexibility and cost- effectiveness needed to perform intermodal transport, connecting classic rail and road lines with a network of thousands of electric vehicles. Vaimoo aims to create the conditions for a mobility experience from the first to the last mile, which is flexible, integrated, safe, on demand, convenient and green. 
Already chosen by the cities of Copenhagen and Rotterdam for their bike-sharing services, Vaimoo is a full-fledged management platform, supported by on-board vehicle telematics and complemented by mobile user interfaces. VAIMOO is also a fleet of easily deployable connected e-bikes designed for durability and quick daily operations, in both station-based, free-floating and mixed sharing schemes. The system can also include kick scooters and motorcycles schemes as well as the integration with third-party systems. 
The Vaimoo flexibility enables teams to modularize the cooperation possibilities with partners and customers, by providing the technology (IoT modules and management software integrable both in new and existing sharing schemes), services (business consulting, custom development), or the full ready-to-be-used sharing system (management platform, user app, infrastructure, vehicles and optionally racks). 
In the case of a full sharing system, bikes are integrated with an innovative docking station for smartphones called MAT (awarded at CES Innovation Awards 2018), wirelessly connected with the locking system of the rack, that provides total control of the vehicle with one single gesture. 
The end-user app offers a new experience of sustainable transport, enabling the access of the city map to verify the available vehicles for booking, contact the Support Team in case of malfunctioning, take advantage of promotions, pay automatically at the end of the riding session and top up the credit. On the service operator side, an advance platform allows the administrator to monitor each vehicle in real time and by remote, enabling: the access of vehicle-sharing dashboard at a glance, the management of the docking stations, the checking of the status and position of each bike, the management of the accounts, users’ payment and invoicing.

If Tony Seba were a company, its slogan might be: The future is coming … faster than you think.
Seba, a Stanford- and MIT-educated entrepreneur, educator, researcher and author, is both lauded and criticized for his bullish predictions on the pace and impact of technology disruption, most notably in energy and transportation.
It’s one thing to say, as Seba does, that the 2020s will be “the most disrupted decade in history.” But it’s another entirely to forecast that electric vehicles will be cheaper than internal combustion vehicles as early as next year — or to declare that by 2025 every new car made will be electric.
Yet that’s the future which Seba’s research, based on a proprietary “disruption framework” analyzing cost curves and technology convergence, points to. And it’s not just cars: “Every new tractor, every new bus, every new truck will be electric, too,” he says.
Along with that change, the model of individual vehicle ownership will dramatically shift to transportation as a service, and be fully realized by 2030, says Seba. That’s a future in which the bulk of driving is done by fleets of electric, automated vehicles; where far fewer people own their own cars; and where cities start to be redesigned to take advantage of all the newly available space no longer needed for parking lots.
Electric Autonomy Canada is delighted that Seba agreed to join us for an exclusive interview from his office in California to discuss his outlook and share his thoughts on what transportation as a service means for Canada.
Electric Autonomy Canada: Is there anything particular about Canada that might hold us back or propel us forward towards the transportation-as-a-service scenario that you envision for 2030?

Tony Seba

Tony Seba: This disruption is going to happen, whether Canada wants it or not. Essentially, it’s going to happen for purely economic reasons. When you have this convergence of on-demand, autonomous and electric transport as a service, the cost per mile of transportation is going to go down by 10 times, from about $1 to 10 cents. Every time we’ve had a 10x decrease in cost, we’ve had a disruption and very quick. So, Canada is going to have to do it. The only question is, will it be upfront and gain the upside, or will it be behind and essentially let others dominate?
Canada has become a leader in information technology, essentially artificial intelligence. And AI is key, of course, to self-driving vehicles, to autonomous vehicles, and is key to pretty much every industry. And Canada is now a hub for AI. So, Canada has an opportunity to be a leader in energy and transportation because it is a technology disruption and Canada has great talent and investors to do that.
On the other hand, Canada is an extraction energy powerhouse. The Canadian government just bought a pipeline. And it owns or protects nukes, power companies and so on. And that could hold Canada back, because essentially the government is going to protect its legacy industries to the detriment of Canadian people.


This disruption is going to happen for purely economic reasons. The cost per mile of transportation is going to go down by 10 times, from about $1 to 10 cents
Tony Seba

Electric Autonomy: You’re very explicit in saying that the economics are driving these changes, that governments shouldn’t subsidize energy technologies. Yet you’re also saying there still is an important role for government to play, in having the right policies. Is that correct?
Tony Seba: Absolutely. Policy is really, really important. The government should set standards, set the right policies. The government also has the power of signalling — by saying we want to be a world leader in clean energy and clean transportation by 2030, that’s signalling. It can enable the right policies for this to happen. But it should allow entrepreneurs and the market to work because that’s where energy is right now.
Electric Autonomy: Here, we’ve got vastly different views on energy and transportation policies between different governments and the federal parties. The differences in direction and potential outcomes seem huge.
Tony Seba: What we have seen in the U.S. is that the states are leading, not the federal government. Look at California. It’s no coincidence that Tesla is here, that autonomous companies from all over the world are here. That’s because the state of California has policies that have enabled electrification, solar, batteries, autonomous technology and so forth. If we can extrapolate from that to Canada, the leadership should come from the provinces.
Electric Autonomy: In Ontario, and Alberta, we have two premiers who are tied to the legacy industries and characterize electric vehicles as symbols of leftism. What advice would you give to municipalities and business leaders in these provinces who are looking to be progressive on this front?
Tony Seba: Part of the mistake that a lot of folks make is to see this purely as environmental topic. This disruption is going to happen for purely economic reasons. When I did the numbers for the U.S., our conclusion was that by going to transport-as-a-service world, because it’s going to be that much cheaper on a per-mile basis, and because it’s going to free us from the cost of owning a car and insurance and gas, the average American family is going to get $6,000 back. That’s a trillion-dollar boost to the economy. On top of that, by not driving to work or to shop, there is another trillion dollars in productivity gains for the economy. So, we’re going to get new jobs and get money back.


The fallacy is that this disruption is going to be government-led, that we’re going to have to make sacrifices, that it’s going to cost us a lot of money. I think that once leaders and policy makers understand that, it’s a no-brainer.
Tony Seba

So, what can they do to enable this that it’s not going to cost us money? One, give every consumer and every business the right to generate, store and sell electricity. Right now, I don’t have to ask permission to publish a blog or sell my computer on eBay, why should I need permission to generate and sell electricity?
Another thing. Once we have Level 4 autonomous technology approved and ready — 2021 or 2022 — that day, essentially, the cost of transport is going to go down by 10x. That’s going to unleash all kinds of innovations and an upside for society in terms of access to work for people who don’t have access to public transportation, for the disabled, for the poor. The social upside for all those demographics is huge.
The government doesn’t need to subsidize EVs for it to happen, it just needs to have the right policies.






The accelerated transition from horses to cars took only 10 years, despite building two industries (oil and auto) and road infrastructure, while fighting WWI @tonyseba speaking at #FutureofPower







Electric Autonomy: Disruption in media has been driven by platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Whatever their benefits, they’ve also decimated local media and raised concerns about the quality of information, privacy, data rights. Is there a similar concern in conceding control of local transportation in Canada to global ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft?
Tony Seba: That’s a great question. Governments are hierarchical, they’re used to making decisions in industries like publishing and telecom and energy that are monopolies or centralized. By and large, they don’t know networks well enough to regulate them. That’s why companies like Facebook got out of hand. It’s a network, and governments by and large don’t know to manage or regulate networks.


So, one thing that we have to start doing — the people in governments that represent us — is to think about how to manage networks from a regulatory perspective, in the best interest of the people, not in the best interest of the networks.
Tony Seba

Today’s ride-hailing model is actually a double-sided network. Drivers on one side and users on the other side. Once you have that double-sided network, the barriers to entry are huge. So how do you get out of that? Well, when you enable autonomous technology, you disable the drivers’ side of the network. What that does is lower the barriers of entry to any company. When you have that, when you essentially have a network of users in transport as a service, anybody — a Ford, a GM, a Google, anybody — can come in with 10,000 or 20,000 cars — autonomous, electric, on-demand — and basically get into that market. So, one way to get us away from the power of the network is enabling autonomous technology.
Electric Autonomy: What about data privacy?
Tony Seba: Data privacy is very, very important. Whose data is it in the self-driving cars? Mapping right now is very important for autonomous technology. Who owns that mapping data? I, as a consumer, I am generating mapping data…who owns that data? Governments should at least make sure that a lot of that data is open, for instance. That data, in the beginning, should be consumer data. And also, some of it should be open, because it’s going to be in the best interest of society. High-definition mapping is digital streets. Today society owns the street. If we go into a mapping world where it’s all private, then basically every street becomes a toll road, to drive on any street you’re going to have to pay somebody who owns the high-definition mapping and we don’t want to go there.
Electric Autonomy: Are you optimistic that we can manage that new way of thinking?
Tony Seba: It will get easier as we move forward to 2030. We’re on the cusp of a lot of great things happening for society. On the other hand, because essentially every industry’s going to be disrupted, the danger is that we don’t take care of the downside. There’s going to be a lot of job losses, then the job gains will come later. Governments should be thinking about how do we protect our workers, to provide them health, a financial cushion and education to make the transition to the new growth industries? If we do that we’re going to be a lot more successful as a society and take advantage of the upside without having to go back to protecting obsolete industries.
WANT MORE ON THE THEMES RAISED BY TONY SEBA?
In future, we’ll be asking Canadian leaders for their reaction and views on these same topics.
Electric Autonomy: Do you have a sense of where the new jobs will be? And when will they come on?
Tony Seba: A lot of the new jobs, we don’t know where they are going to be, because new industries are going to create new opportunities that we can’t even envision. But we do know that the whole battery industry goes through the roof. Basically, this is a huge growth market. Countries should be investing in battery R&D and battery infrastructure and capacity rather than buying pipelines and nuclear power plants. Batteries, big growth. EVs, big growth. Wind. Solar. Autonomous technologies. All of these are big growth areas that are going to generate huge work over the next decade, if not two.
That’s one area. Another is construction. Individuals park their car for 96% of time. When you have transport as a service, individuals are not going to own cars because it doesn’t make any sense, it’s going to be fleets that drive around and don’t need to park. Essentially, a third or so of the land mass of cities is going to open up to people, to businesses, to green parks and that is going to generate a massive construction boom. Affordable housing, check; new business, check; new green spaces, check.
Electric Autonomy: Last question. You are often challenged for your ambitious forecasts. But in March, BloombergNEF updated its annual projection on the declining cost of EVs. It now foresees EVs becoming cheaper than internal combustion vehicles in 2022. Two years ago, it said 2026. With a year to go until 2020, they’ve nearly matched your forecast. Any comment?
Tony Seba: First, they ignore you, then they attack you, then you win. That’s how mainstream analysis and insiders work. The tipping point is happening as we predicted, the analysts are missing a lot of pieces for this equation. In particular, what the mainstream analysts are missing is fleets. They still see EVs as a one-to-one substitution for privately owned automobiles. The disruption will be when fleets start becoming electrified, automated and more widespread.

CAR SHARE MARKET IN CANADA
 
As of January, 2018, Canada had 20 car sharing services in operation with more than 336,000 members and 5,200 vehicles. In 2017, there were 3,300 car-sharing vehicles operating in the city of Vancouver alone, dubbed the ‘car-sharing capital of North America.’ A recent Vancity survey has revealed that 95% of ‘Vancouverites’ choose car-sharing services for the convenience, 62% to save money and 58% due to the concern for the environment.  
The are two types of car-sharing, one-way and two-way. An example of one-way sharing is car2go. You take the car from A to B and can drop it off anywhere in the service area. With a two-way car, you book by the hour and you pick it up and drop it off in the same place. The Canadian carshare market is also made up of many players, including small, local, non-profit co-operatives such as Kootenay Carshare. However the top Canadian carshare giants are:
CAR2GO
car2go launched in Ulm, Germany in 2008 before making its North American debut in Austin, Texas in 2010 and offers one-way carsharing. In Canada, it is available in Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal, as well as 30 other cities worldwide. Included in membership is fuel, insurance and free parking at all permit and residential areas. The car2go fleet contains electric vehicles, but only in Europe and Montreal.
If you are a Canadian member, you can also use the car2go’s carshare services anywhere in North America. However, in May 2018, car2go shut down its services in Toronto. Local Toronto residents complained when the company suggested its users park in any legal space, including those in residential areas. The Toronto city council passed a pilot that was heavily restrictive on carshare operators which included $1,500 parking permit fees per vehicle. The company said that these new rules would mean almost 10,000 parking would be off-limits for its customers, rendering the company inoperable, which is why they suspended their services.
ENTERPRISE CARSHARE
Originally Autoshare, it began in Toronto in 1998 before Enterprise Rent-a-Car bought the company in 2014. Enterprise carshare offers two-way car-sharing and is available in Regina, Sackville, New Brunswick, Saskatoon and Toronto as well as 35 American states. Fuel and insurance is included.
ZIPCAR


Zipcar was launched in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2000 and offers two-way car sharing. Zipcar has 10,000 vehicles in more than 480 cities across the world. In Canada it is available in Victoria, Vancouver, London (Ontario), Kitchener/Waterlook (Ontario), Toronto and Ottawa. Zipcar members can choose from over 50 different makes and models ranging from luxury vehicles to large vans.


COMMUNAUTO
Communauto launched In 1994, in Quebec City is unique because it offers round-trip, free-floating carsharing. It is available in Montreal, Ottawa, Quebec City, Halifax and Gatineau and Sherbrook in Quebec. Unlike other carshare providers, members do not have to pay fees for one-way sharing. The rates are 38 cents per minute and $12 per hour instead. Insurance and fuel are included and Communauto has more than 1,880 vehicles on the roads, including electric vehicles such as the Nissan Leaf.
The company recently acquired Halifax car-sharing company, CarShare Atlantic in January 2019. CarShare Atlantic is known for its introduction of vehicles that are accessible by everyone into its fleet, which includes a fully automated vehicle for people with physical disabilities.
Communauto also entered the Toronto market under the new pilot regulations of the city with a free-floating service offer. During the first phase of the pilot in November 2018, Communauto FLEX will operate in the downtown core with 200 cars servicing 50 square kilometres.
MODO
Modo was North-America’s first car sharing co-operative and started as a thesis project in 1997. It offers two-way car-sharing and is available in Vancouver, Lower Mainland, B.C and Victoria. There is a monthly fee of $5, unless you are an owner – you can buy a $500 share. Being an owner puts your rates at $5/hour compared to the $8/hour. Insurance and fuel are provided to members. Vehicles included are Hatchbacks, convertibles, CUVs, trucks, hybrids, electric vehicles, minivans and cargo vans.
Modo has grown substantially since Evo and car2go entered the Vancouver market and currently has 700 vehicles in its fleet. The company continues to expand on its model and is highly innovative using the latest in-house technology. For example, a new feature that they offer is Open Return. Since the car share revolution began, there has only been one way to book a trip and that is with an end time in mind. Modo’s latest feature allows the user the luxury of booking the car for a full 24 hours but only paying for the length of time the car was in use and it only costs $3.
Modo is also partnering with Translink, Evo Car Share and Mobi bike share in a pilot to offer integrated travel to the residents of Metro Vancouver. When each method of transport in connected and effectively communicating with each other, it creates seamless, easier travels routes for its users.
EVO
Evo began in 2015 and was launched by BCAA. It offers one-way carsharing and is only available in Vancouver. A one-time $35 registration fee is required and the rates are 41 cents per minute, $14.99 per hour or $89.99 per day. Fuel, insurance, free parking all permit and residential only areas are included for their members.
We created a strategy for Evo, that focused on consistent customer service and fleet operations and implemented this strategy in Vancouver. We did this through an internal pilot project, creating a seamless infleeting chain, building an internal call center, hiring dedicated teams and producing a complete library of all fleet and customer service processes. Our goal was to ensure that Evo carshare offers the best carshare fleet and service in Vancouver. 
One main aim for introducing car sharing to Canadian citizens was to eliminate the high numbers of car ownership in the country. In a survey of carshare member however, 28% said they find it more convenient to carshare on occasion but still own a car, due to the strict geographical limitations of many services. However, 25% of those surveyed said they had no more need for a private vehicle and “threw away the key” and 12% said they simply couldn’t afford to buy a car.
RIDE HAILING MARKET IN CANADA
Ride-hailing, although available in many Canadian provinces is still a contentious subject, particularly in British Columbia. Currently, there are only 14 regions in Canada that have ride-sharing services available, a few of which include; Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal.
These cities make up around 50% of the country’s population. It’s still very much an urban service and overall, Canada’s ride-sharing service is quite small. At present ride hailing revenue in Canada amounts to US$829m, in comparison to China’s US$35,589m. However, this figure is expected to grow by 2023, with ride-hailing revenue forecasted at US$1,067m.
However, after years of waiting, British Columbians may also be able to catch a ride in an Uber or Lyft – but not quite yet. The B.C. government has introduced legislation to allow ride-hailing in the province by sometime in 2019. The proposed changes include amendments to eight provincial statutes. For example, drivers for ride-hail services will need to have Class 4 licences. This means they’ll have to have criminal record and medical fitness checks every five years.
Similar to British Columbia, Saskatchewan has also passed legislation to allow ride-hailing vehicles in the province. The Vehicles for Hire Act allows ride-sharing companies to operate in Saskatchewan, but gives municipalities responsibility for issuing licences, deciding how licences are allocated, who can drive a ride-share vehicle, setting standards for the vehicles themselves, and setting fees, rates or fares. In February Saskatoon was the first city to introduce Uber to the streets of Saskatchewan.
Some of the bigger ride-hail services currently operating in Canada are, Uber, Facedrive – a Canadian startup aims to pay its drivers better than Uber and offer them the opportunity to be a part of a cooperative business structure, European car sharing company Taxify and Lyft, only available in Toronto, but Uber’s biggest competition.
Ridehailing also has the power in supporting smaller towns transport needs such as Innisfil, Ontario. The town is moving away from more common methods of public transportation such as buses and is opting in for ridehailing services instead. The town is partnering with Uber and subsidizing the cost of rides for its users, offering flat rates on Uber Pool. It is an experimental partnership, but one that is estimated to save $8 million per year.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTION IN CANADA

Canada is behind the majority of other developed-world peers when it comes to adopting EV technology. Canadian consumers in general are not opposed to EV adoption but with government policy and the local auto industry not keeping pace, with regards to public and private EV infrastructure, buying an electric car in Canada can be an expensive risk.
In a survey of 30 member countries by GoCompare, Canada was found to have 23,620 electric cars on the roads at the end of 2017. That’s a lower number than in many smaller countries, including Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Canada also placed seventh with regards to EV infrastructure, with 0.56 stations per 100 kilometres of road. In comparison, the Netherlands has 23.25 charging stations per 100 km of road and is number one in the world.
However, these results came from studies and surveys conducted in 2017. According to Fleetcarma, in the first nine months of 2018, electric vehicle sales in Canada (hybrids included) were up by 158% compared to the same period in 2017. Incentives such as rebates for plug-in vehicles, incentives for charging stations at homes, stratas and workplaces are available to B.C. residents, businesses, non-profit organizations and local government organizations.
However, we do see electric vehicles being incorporated into car share fleets, such as Car2Go, Evo, Zipcar. Hopefully with a large scale introduction of EV infrastructure across Canadian cities, we will see a spike in fleets offering electric and hybrid vehicles.
CANADIAN MICROMOBILITY OFFERINGS 
There are many bike share providers operating across Canada. Vancouver, for example has Mobi by Shaw Go, which started in 2016 and has more than 1,400 bicycles and almost 150 solar-powered stations and 75,000 users.
Other areas of British Columbia also offer bike share services. In Greater Victoria, TapBike converts regular bicycles to smart bikes using a Bluetooth locking system and Kelowna started an 18-month dockless bike-share pilot with Dropbike in the spring.
American company, LimeBike launched the first ever e-bike share network in Calgary, which is a success whenever the weather co-operates. Lime released 375 electric pedal, dockless bikes into the streets of the city. The company sends out crews to pick up bikes and charge them so they do not have to be returned to charging stations.
E-SCOOTER SHARING
Last October, Waterloo city council voted to yes to the implementation of a new micro-mobility solution. The pilot project is also being hosted by Lime. The city was targeted because of its strong tech community and will be bringing e-scooters to its residents in the not-too-distant future.
It’s not just Waterloo that is hoping to implement the current trend in mobility – electric scooters and electric bikes could be on Edmonton roads as early as this summer. If successful, these pilot schemes could pave the way to the introduction of micromobility across the Canadian shared mobility landscape.
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IN CANADA
Last year alone there were more than 37,000 road fatalities in the US and 1,800 in Canada. Over 90% of crashes were caused by human error. The introduction of AVs is a way of significantly reducing these numbers.
Ottawa is the not only the capital city of Canada, but the Autonomous Vehicle capital of Canada as well. There are more that 70 companies and organizations creating AV clusters in key technology centres across the city. Each company contributes expertise and technology in areas like software, cybersecurity, IoT to AVs and much more. Anchored by global AV leader BlackBerry QNX, more than 45 of the firms that comprise Ottawa’s AV cluster are located in Kanata North Technology Park, the largest of its kind in Canada. This was also the location of Canada’s first ‘on-road’ autonomous vehicle testing.
However, the Canadian Senate Committee on Transport and Communications report for 2018, found Canada “ill-equipped for the fast-growing future of transportation” and called on the federal government to develop a national strategy. In an effort to combat the lack of infrastructure, cities such as Vancouver and Surrey submitted a $50 million joint application to the Federal Infrastructure Canada Smart Cities Challenge.
ELECTRONIC AUTOMATION
As part of the Smart Cities bid, the City of Vancouver and Surrey have teamed up and welcomed an ELA (Electronic Automation) shuttle, so that local residents can experience riding in a driverless vehicle. The EZ10 Driverless Shuttle – is already being used in several countries around the world. The shuttle is a fully-accessible, 100% electric vehicle with a battery life of up to 14 hours. It holds up to 12 passengers and will travel at about 12 km/h during the demo but has a maximum travelling speed of 40 km/h.
If the cities of Vancouver and Surrey are chosen as the winning submission for the Smart Cities Challenge, they will be able to “demonstrate the path to safer, healthier and more connected communities while reducing emissions, improving transportation efficiency, and enhancing livability in the face of rapid growth and traffic congestion.”

Ride sharing on app-based taxi services is catching up. Now researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi have developed an algorithm that can guide taxi drivers to take a route where they can find more commuters for sharing. They believe this algorithm can make shared rides more profitable for drivers and reduce waiting time for commuters as well.
To make cabs more economical for customers, many taxi-service companies are promoting ride-share among commuters. Here two or more ride-orders are completed by a single taxi driver who can complete these rides without deviating much in a given travel route. The taxi company benefits from such ride shares as it increases their customer base, reduces fuel and allows them to maximize profits from limited number of vehicles.
However, often a compatible ride order may not possible on a given route due to which company may incur loss as it has to notify charges to ride-share customers even before they take a cab.
“In the current scenario, the appearance of subsequent compatible customers is left to luck — a taxi moves along the shortest (or quickest) path for the existing customer and hopes to find additional compatible customers on its way,” said Amitabha Bagchi, associate professor, IIT, New Delhi while explaining the problem to India Science Wire.
The new algorithm is more efficient in searching compatibility between ride-orders. Called ‘Share’ (Sharing with History-Aware Route Recommendations), it finds routes beyond shortest paths and recommends a route that is close in length to the shortest path and offers higher chance of finding a compatible ride-order. 
To verify the algorithms, researchers tested it on real taxi datasets from New York and Singapore across a range of metrics. The results showed that routes recommended by the algorithm received up to 40 per cent reduction in orders without ride-sharing than the shortest path. Also, this reduces waiting time for customers by 20 per cent.
“We would like to see how our algorithm works on Indian conditions by collaborating with one of the taxi operators from India. We are also extending this work for the food delivery business,” added Bagchi.
The research team included Chak Fai Yuen, Abhishek Pratap Singh, Sagar Goyal and Sayan Ranu. (India Science Wire)

It’s a chilly Thursday night in late January, and Detroiter Tamara Ballinger is waiting for a bus at DDOT’s Rosa Parks Transit Center. The 21-year-old college student and fast food worker is sitting on a bench listening intently to music on her smartphone, seemingly oblivious to the cold. But when asked about how she navigates between home, work, and school, her eyes light up a little.
“I take the bus home from work. And if I get off late, I take a Lyft or a cab,” she says. “I like Lyft, but the cab is a little too expensive. I wish they had 24-hour bus service [on my route].”
Not far away, Vincent Further-Bey, 54, a recent Texas transplant to Detroit, says he relies on the bus system to get to his distribution center job in Livonia. When the topic of electric scooters comes up, though, he’s eager to share his thoughts.
“A friend of mine comes down here [to the transit center] and takes a scooter to Grand River and Livernois,” he says. “I’ll be using them this summer to check out downtown.”
For Ballinger and Further-Bey and many other commuters, the streets of Detroit aren’t what they used to be. The city’s transportation landscape has shifted dramatically; new services like electric scooters and bike sharing have become part and parcel to how people get around in the Motor City these days.
Connected mobility
To bus riders, new transportation modes mean more choices. And they offer new solutions for covering the distance from work and homes to bus stops, what’s known as the first/last mile problem. But the emergence of this patchwork of options also raises questions about which services to use and how to navigate between them.
Detroit is rapidly transforming into a multimodal city where people rely on several different ways to get around. Megan Owens is executive director of Transportation Riders United (TRU), a nonprofit Metro Detroit transit advocacy group that held a public forum on new mobility services and technology last fall.
For the most part, says Owens, TRU feels “the more transportation options people have the better,” whether as an additional alternative or as a way to bridge the first/last mile problem. That said, Owens stresses the importance of not looking at the arrival of new transit modes as a cure-all for the region’s transportation needs.
“Our biggest concern is how do we make sure these are options are for everyone,” she says, “whether it’s the 92-year-old grandma who doesn’t have a smartphone, or people who don’t have bank accounts, or people in wheelchairs.”
Multimodal city, multimodal region
While taxis, buses, and the People Mover have been here for some time, over the last ten years there’s been a surge of new transportation alternatives.
DDOT started getting bike racks on buses around 2008, a move that has allowed bicyclists to integrate buses into their trips and, in turn, enjoy more flexibility in how they get around. Since that time, the city has built an impressive 240-mile network of bike lanes. The on-demand ride hailing service Uber, which relies on a smartphone app to connect drivers and riders came online here in 2013. Its competitor Lyft set up shop the following year. May 2017 saw the launch of MoGo, a dock-based public bike share system. And last year, three dockless electric scootercompanies — Bird, Lime and Spin — arrived in Detroit, as did May Mobility autonomous shuttles, self-driving electric vehicles that can carry up to six people along a predetermined loop.
In 2016, Detroit’s Mayor Mike Duggan established an Office of Mobility Innovation to coordinate new additions like these. And two years in, it’s borne some intriguing fruit.
Last summer, DDOT and MoGo partnered up on a limited-time offer to provide free 30-day bike share passes to bus riders who bought long-term bus passes. In May, the agency kicked off a pilot program with Lyft to help bus riders cover late gaps in bus coverage. DDOT passengers who text a certain phone number can get a $7 credit towards a Lyft ride during designated hours.
And in the fall, DDOT released an upgrade to its bus tracking and trip planning app, Transit, making it easier to seamlessly connect with Uber and Lyft. The app can also be used to access MoGo’s bike sharing services.
The Rosa Parks Transit Center is a hub in central Detroit.
“The City of Detroit Office of Mobility Innovation is doing a good job of trying to stay on top of these things,” says Owens. “Cities certainly have a challenge in that regard, when things like the new scooters just literally show up one day.”
Unlike Ann Arbor, which warned dockless scooter users to stay off the sidewalks and bike lanes and initially confiscated those parked improperly in the public right-of-way, Detroit has been more embracing of the new mobility technology. Late last year it raised the cap on Bird and Lime scooters from 300 to 400 each with the understanding more would be placed in neighborhoods outside downtown.
Creating space to move
Todd Scott is executive director of the Detroit Greenways Coalition. For a person whose organization played a considerable role in building up Detroit’s biking and walking infrastructure, he has an interesting take on how it relates to the scooters.
“I don’t know if it’s right to call it just bike infrastructure, because it accommodates bikes and scooters both very well,” he says. “And in some ways, I think the scooters are going to encourage the city to make more investments in bike lanes.”
Right now, Scott is in the thick of developing the Joe Louis Greenway, a 26-mile trail that will run a ring around the heart of Detroit. He’s excited about what it and MoGo’s upcoming expansion into more city neighborhoods and several Oakland County communities will mean for city and regional transit.
A new dedicated walking and biking path will facilitate faster, safer trips for cyclists with minimal motorized vehicle interactions as they commute through Detroit’s core city to get to work, school, and shopping locations. And the expansion of MoGo, in tandem with a new 17.1-mile bike route through many of the same communities, called the Woodward Corridor Neighborhood Bicycle Network, could play a role in normalizing bicycling as a mobility option throughout the region.
Metropolitan connectivity is also a topic of interest for the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG), which intends to include new mobility options in its next long-range regional transportation plan.
“Our policy recommendations include encouraging projects that integrate first- and last-mile connections to increase accessibility … [and] collaboration with new mobility providers such as bikeshare and e-scooters to collect and share data,” SEMCOG spokesperson Sue Stetler said in an email.
As a member of the of Southeast Michigan’s Regional Transit Authority Citizens’ Advisory Committee, Owens says that RTA is also actively looking into new mobility pilots and ways to integrate these new services. And that’s got her feeling good about the future of new mobility options in Metro Detroit.
“We need to make sure that people don’t go overboard and think we don’t need transit anymore,” she says. “But as long as they’re seen as an addition, I’m pretty optimistic about where things are headed.”

There’s a scene in the movie Planes, Trains and Automobiles where Steve Martin’s character, Neal, is dropped off in the middle of a rental car lot, looking for a car that isn’t there.
By the time he returns to the rental counter he’s frustrated, annoyed and tired.
It’s a relatable moment for many of us who travel as part of our jobs, but it’s one that is becoming rarer as business travelers opt for Uber and Lyft over car rentals.
New data from Epsilon-Conversant highlights this dramatic shift in the habits of business travelers.
Data shows that from Q2 2016 to Q1 2018, 63% of car rental customers reduced their spending on rentals and 56% stopped using car rental services entirely.
And while the insights show a clear trend towards rideshare services, there are growth opportunities for both rideshare and car rental companies.
Similar to many other industries, all signs point towards the need for evolution by both traditional car rental companies and rideshare services to stay competitive.
Here are three tips to help car rental and rideshare companies alike to co-exist and grow.
Surviving and thriving
Create personalized experiences where you can
Car rental companies can only take the personalized customer experience so far.
They can’t compete with rideshare services that allow riders to select the type of car picking them up and see the name of the driver, but they can do a handful of things to make the car rental experience much more enjoyable.
Focus on the digital and counter experiences where customers spend the bulk of time engaging with your brand.
Don’t sleep on peer-to-peer ridesharing
Peer-to-peer car services such as Drive Now, Reach Now and Getaround are popping up and pose a threat to both rideshare services and car rental companies.
Think about it: most cars spend most of their time sitting. Especially in major cities, cars might find themselves parked for days at a time unused.
Even in suburban areas, cars will sit in parking lots from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. as people work the day away.
There are opportunities for these differing business models to converge and provide the ultimate transportation experience for a wide array of consumer preferences and needs.
Identify opportunities for investment and/or joint-mobility ventures
While this is still a couple of years out, it won’t surprise me if a rideshare company snatches up a struggling rental car company or a rental car company invests in a peer-to-peer car sharing.
Consumer preferences shift depending on where they’re headed. It’s a matter of convenience.
I’m not going to treat my trip to Dallas the same as I would New York or Chicago. Investment or partnerships provide flexibility and the ability to reach individuals where they prefer.
Important steps to take
We’ve been down this road before. Blockbuster gave way to Redbox, which is now struggling keep up with Netflix. Instagram challenged Kodak as the most recognizable photo brand.
And today, direct-to-consumer brands are challenging their traditional counterparts with rich, first-party data.
Car rental companies should not take the $3.2 billion loss to rideshare companies lightly—the time to implement change, innovate and evolve is now.
In some instances, legacy brands not only adapt, but grow and thrive during a time of industry disruption.
Others flounder and die.
If they’re to survive, car rental companies must look holistically at the transportation industry and make the necessary changes that allow them to determine their own destiny.

As shared mobility gains traction in India, 51 per cent of millennials are questioning the need to own a vehicle, according to a global study by Deloitte.
As per Deloitte’s 2019 Global Automotive Consumer Study, consumers in India feel empowered trusting the power of digital solutions that make their commute safer.
It also said 76 per cent of respondents in India were in favour of connected vehicles with 84 per cent feeling that connected vehicles will be beneficial in providing suggestions regarding safer routes along with updates to improve road safety and prevent potential collisions.
“Shared mobility is another trend which is gaining momentum in India. The report uncovers a clear generational divide when it comes to shared mobility,” Deloitte said.
Compared to the older generation, younger consumers are more likely to understand the idea of shared mobility and to question whether vehicle ownership is a necessity.
Therefore, ride-hailing has been integrated in some markets and the concept is progressing in India, the report added.
As per the report, 51 per cent of Gen Y/Z users in India are questioning the need for an owned vehicle, while 44 per cent of Gen X have similar thoughts.
On the other hand, only 34 per cent of pre/boomers generation have questioned the need for an owned vehicle, the Deloitte added.
Commenting on the findings, Deloitte India Partner Rajeev Singh said, “India is at the cusp of digital transformation as we see a whole new way of engagement, interactivity and consumption pattern. With that, the future is truly going to be driven by mobile connectivity and digital power.”
He further said even though the daily usage of personally owned vehicles in India is quite high, the cumulative vehicle sales for the country have seen a sharp decline over the last year.
“It is expected that the younger audience would subvert the trend of personally owned vehicles in the time to come with their growing affinity, towards shared mobility and digital technologies,” Singh said.
Currently in India, 47 per cent of consumers use their own vehicle everyday which is expected to increase to 50 per cent in the next three years, the report said.
As part the study, Deloitte said over 10,000 consumers across Australia, China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Southeast Asia shared their views on critical issues impacting the automotive sector.

The Hyderabad Metro Rail project still lacks an efficient first and last-mile connectivity and a common ticket for different commutes even as it sees a steady rise in passengers with the number inching towards three-lakh mark every day.
Once the Raidurg station on Corridor 3 gets operational, trains with better frequency would ensure more passengers to hop in and ease crowd pressure during peak hours, but a lot more effort is needed to make the first and last-mile connectivity towards metro stations reliable and affordable.
Shuttle services are being run by some firms at Hi-Tec City and Durgam Cheruvu stations, while the L&T Metro Rail is running them from stations like Secunderabad East, Tarnaka, Mettuguda and others. Yet, these are either insufficient or the frequency of 15-30 minutes is not working out, if passengers reactions are anything to go by.
“I have shifted back to MMTS, which is less-crowed and also convenient to get transport from the railway station to my office at Kondapur. Metro ride was comfortable, but after alighting at Hi-Tec City, it is a nightmare to get into shuttle bus or shared auto-rickshaws packed to capacity,” says Kusuma, an IT professional, travelling from Begumpet.
“Unless you share the auto, the fare is flat ₹50 or ₹100 at metro stations to travel to nearby offices or residences,” was the most heard comment. Kalpana, a banking professional, thinks it is more convenient to take a shared cab from Mahendra Hills to Jubilee Hills Check Post than travel in metro.
“Commute by auto or cab to Parade Grounds station from home and again to office from Jubilee Hills Check Post metro station is more than double the metro ticket fare. It is more convenient to take a shared cab with my colleagues,” she says. Or take the case of Murthy, a private sector employee, commuting to Begumpet from Bandlaguda.
He changes two buses or shared autos to reach Nagole/Uppal metro station spending ₹40 in either direction.
Those sharing a cab shell out about ₹50-₹80 per head to catch the metro rail moving towards Ameerpet and from onward to Hi-Tec City. “We have an RTC depot in the vicinity, but after a couple of months of shuttle services, they were withdrawn,” says Mr. Murthy.
“Time travelled in metro is being wasted waiting for half-hour shuttle service every day,” tweeted Prashant M., travelling to DLF from Hi-Tec City. And, the promise of a common ticket for use through metro, auto, cabs, bus and train could have prevented unfettered fare rip-offs, but it is not in sight.

In 2019, the world relies on various forms of transportation more than ever before to get around on a day-to-day basis. Whether it’s heading to the supermarket for weekly shopping, traveling to work, visiting friends and family, or going abroad for a week in the sun, the world today has access to buses, trains, planes, bicycles, trams, and many more modes of transport, making it the easiest it’s ever been to travel both short and long distances across the globe.
Over the last 200 years, transportation has completely transformed. In 1804 the first steam railway was built. In 1885-1886 the first credited automobile was created by Karl Benz in Germany, 1903 saw the creation of the first powered aircraft, and in 1942 the first ever rocket reached space. The transportation industry has clearly hit some huge milestones over the past 200 years.
So, how will transport evolve by 2100?
We live in a digital age where technology has become entwined and embedded in our society. This technological revolution has impacted all industries, including transport, with the world now witnessing self-driving cars, drones that can deliver goods to your doorstep, and billionaires who are hoping to transport humans to Mars in the next couple of decades.
RS Components has collated the most exciting predictions set to take place over the next century in this graphic. Are you ready for the changes set to happen in the transport industry?
Autonomous Cars
Driverless cars have been discussed for a long period of time now by the likes of Elon Musk, who has recently claimed that a true self-driving Tesla will exist by 2020, where passengers could even snooze in the driver’s seat while the car takes you from point A to B.
Autonomous car technology is also being developed by the likes of BMW and Mercedes, however this development is still very much in its testing stages. Having said that, these tests are set to be implemented by 2025, which is predicted to be the year this development emerges further and is implemented with the concept of driverless taxis. Will Elon Musk beat this with his Tesla’s?
The result of driverless cars is that there will no longer be a need to own a personal car, instead people can choose to subscribe to car-sharing driverless plans.
Drive through the Skies
By 2050 global populations are expected to reach 9.8 billion. At the same time, the UK population is expected to exceed 70 million [2] by 2030, growing by a further 7 million [3] to reach 77 million by 2050.
This large growth in population across the world and the UK will lead to a huge increase in the number of road users and other systems of transportation as they look to commute for work and leisure.
While the number of people traveling will increase, the capacity of routes currently available are unlikely to keep pace due to the road and underground systems being restricted in the routes and numbers they can hold. As such, humans will need to look for alternative transport routes.
For these reasons, the Irish SpaceX Hyperloop pod competition team, Éirloop, has predicted that humans will be “driving in the sky” where far more space can be found than on roads or underground. This will allow for higher volumes of people to travel and at higher speeds, cutting travel times.
Fly in Style
When we fly to our desired destination, lots of us peek our heads through the window to see the beautiful sights below as we are cruising through the skies. Unfortunately, at the moment the view is limited on most planes with the windows being small in size. By 2030 this is all set to change, as these windows will be replaced altogether by the fuselage becoming a big screen. Not only will this give passengers a far more impressive view, it will also make the aircraft lighter and faster, seeing less fuel burnt as a result.
Travel to Space via Hyperloop
Traveling to space is a dream nearly all of us share, as we look up to the skies and wonder what it might be like to transport out of Earth and experience outer space. While in the past space has always been reserved for the most advanced astronauts, this is all set to change in the future with the rise of commercial travel to space, which has become increasingly topical as billionaires such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson are all working to get people into space over the next couple of decades.
But by 2100, it is expected that space travel will be taking place via Hyperloop, which will transport passengers to other colonies outside of Earth.
A Green Future
Governments are currently undergoing huge policy changes to ensure cars become emission free over the next two decades, by banning gas- and diesel-powered cars due to the air pollution problems they cause. By 2030 it is predicted that all ground transport, including cars, buses, and trains, will be driven by renewable energies to tackle this global issue.
In the same year airplanes will have no windows, but rather the fuselage will be a big screen, making the aircraft lighter as a result which will mean less fuel is being burnt.
Are you ready for the next century of transport?

Commuting these days isn’t what it used to be. Instead of trying to draw workers into Boston, some Massachusetts businesses are often trying to get their most coveted employees to leave the city — at least for the work day.
Creating solutions to the so-called “first mile/last mile problem” helps make that possible. It means providing a way for workers to both get to the train — the first mile — and then how to get them to work — the last mile.
This is true in many parts of the state, but especially in the fast-growing region west of Boston.
Paul Matthews is the executive director of the 495/Metrowest Partnership, a coalition of 35 communities from Westford to Foxboro. For years, he and others have been trying to make the commuter rail work, not only for businesses in Boston, but also the other way around — for the growing industries along Route 495. But Matthews said to make the train truly viable, you must get people from train stations to their workplaces.
“This is New England,” Matthews said. “You can’t get off the train in January and walk 2.5 miles to your place of work. You need a way of stepping onto a shuttle and getting there.”
That shuttle most often takes the form of a van seating up to 16 people. But providing those shuttles to the almost 200,000 people working in MetroWest but living elsewhere is requiring people to get creative.




Doug Halley is the transportation coordinator for the town of Acton and for the CrossTown Connect Transportation Management Association, an effort funded by seven Massachusetts towns trying to get commuters out of their cars. Halley said they provide door-to-door service for seniors and for those with physical disabilities, and do commuter shuttles for area businesses. The shuttles drive local residents to the commuter rail so they can work in Boston, and bring workers coming in from Cambridge and Boston to work at companies along Route 495.





Halley thinks the MBTA could do a lot more to promote what’s called “reverse commuting” by lowering, or even eliminating, outbound fares.
“The trains are virtually empty,” Halley said. “Why even worry about charging those people coming out? Once they establish the ridership base, they can start increasing those fares, but initially they should be encouraging people to come out here. The businesses out here need them.“
In some cases, the employees need the shuttles as well. Peter Lowitt, who manages economic development for the office park at Fort Devens in central Mass., said many of the 130 reverse commuters at Devens depend on the commuter rail and the shuttle.
“In many cases, but for the shuttle bus, those folks wouldn’t be employed,” Lowitt said. “I was speaking with a gal who commutes out from Cambridge and she said she wouldn’t have taken the job if the commuter rail wasn’t here.”
MBTA officials have acknowledged they haven’t done enough to promote reverse commuting, but are now talking about testing reduced fares for reverse commuters — though not on all rail lines, and not on the Fitchburg train that serves Devens.
The state is also pledging to give more support to the shuttle van programs as a way to solve the first mile/last mile problems. Earlier this month, the MassDOT announced it would give $1.5 million to organizations like CrossTown Connect that can come up with creative solutions.
An example is the Maynard/Acton Commuter Shuttle, which connects people to the South Acton Train Station two and a half miles outside of town. It also transports workers coming in from Boston to their jobs in Maynard. Usage of the shuttle has grown in three years, from 100 rides per month up to 800.
The commuter shuttles that run in Maynard, Acton, Littleton and four other nearby towns are examples of the kinds of collaborative approaches that Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack says the state is looking to fund.
“The reason people aren’t trying other ways of commuting to work and driving by themselves is not lack of information. It’s actually lack of services,” Pollack said at a recent transportation conference.
Some advocates think the state could be doing more to promote these first mile/last mile services, like shuttles. Once people learn the shuttles are there and start using them, they keep using them. And as ridership grows, it means more people are getting to and from work without using their cars.
That fulfills what Pollack says is today’s transportation imperative: “To move more people in fewer vehicles.”

The rise of car sharing could slash property prices with inner-city buyers increasingly happy to forgo a parking space for other transport alternatives.
With parking becoming less crucial to buyers, developers are increasingly doing away with a car spot for every apartment and turning to car share.
At Central Park — one of Sydney’s biggest redevelopments in the past decade — about 700 residents, or one in 10, are car-share members utilising about 50 spaces in GoGet SuperPods at the One Central Park and Duo buildings.
With the area’s last residents moving in to the neighbouring Wonderland building, another SuperPod — 10 or more car-share spots — is due to open.
The Chippendale development delivered 0.6 car spaces per apartment, but it would be even fewer now if construction was to start again, said Central Park project director Mick Caddey, from Frasers Property Australia.
“Car share … was only in its infancy of development [when we started],” Mr Caddey said. “[We have a] pretty low car ratio and if I was developing today I might even squeeze that down further. [Generally] now, our studios and a very large proportion of one-bedroom apartments would not have a car space.”
Central Park is one of about 100 developments nationally which has GoGet parking, with about 9 per cent – 280 – of their 3000 vehicles in developments. They had 120 vehicles across 50 developments less than two years ago.
About 140,000 people are now members of GoGet and more than 60,000 people are members of Car Next Door.
“Sydney is where we are really seeing the big push,” said Chris Vanneste, head of locations and partnerships at GoGet. “[But] we’re starting to see a really big start up in Brisbane … and in Melbourne we have them in a lot of developments, but at a smaller scale.”
Chippendale has the highest proportion of GoGet users in the country, with some Central Park residents reportedly selling their cars or deciding not to buy one in order to car share. While vehicle numbers have increased with the population in recent years, there’s been an overall decline in the percentage of car owners.
“[In the early days] we got a lot of pushback from the sales team that they couldn’t sell apartments without parking spaces, [then they realised] as long as you provide an alternate service it works,” Mr Vanneste said.
“We’re starting to have developers talk to us now about car-share only developments … because it’s such a huge cost [to provide basement parking].”
Mr Caddey said an underground parking space could add $50,000 to the cost of an apartment, a substantial increase particularly for studio and one-bedroom apartments. The extra cost, combined with the purchase and running costs of a car, equated to a lot of public transport, ride-share and car-share trips, he added.
However stripping back parking in new developments was a balancing act, Mr Caddey said. While there was little resistance at Central Park, it was a different story in lower density areas with less public transport options and amenity.
It is an issue inner-west mayor Darcy Byrne is all too familiar with.
“You’ve got two competing imperatives, if you reduce requirements for parking in new development you increase affordability of housing significantly … on the other hand if you build new developments and there is not either parking capacity or good public transport, it creates chaos in public streets,” Cr Byrne said.
The inner west council has more than 80 allocated car-share spots and has partnered with GoGet to roll out up to 20 more as part of a pilot program integrating car share with the light rail. It’s one of almost 50 councils GoGet has partnered with and is neck and neck with Melbourne City Council for the highest number of spots after the City of Sydney.
“There is significant demand for first and last-mile journey [options] and, given our public transport system is generally not very well integrated, it seems like a good opportunity,” Cr Byrne said.
However it had to be balanced with concerns raised by the community about dedicated car-sharing spaces resulting in a loss of parking for residents, he said.
“The entire time I’ve been in local government, parking has always been close to the number one issue, but we’re never going to get big enough streets for everyone to have a car … as the population starts to increase, we have to look at innovative alternatives,” Cr Byrne said.
“We do need to transition aways from dependence on private vehicles. [But] I don’t think we’re going to see private car ownership disappear anytime soon … it will continue to be a balancing act.”
Mr Vanneste said he would like to see the pilot program, if successful, rolled out statewide so people could use public transport for most of their journey and a car for the last leg if needed.
While he initially saw car share as an inner-city service, Mr Vanneste said there was more demand than expected in areas like Parramatta, Liverpool and Sydney Olympic Park. He noted the company would continue to expand across the city, focusing on transport corridors.

It’s been less than a year since city leaders were freaking out about the proliferation of dock-less bike shares, which were clogging sidewalks and ending up in trees and vacant lots. Despite some consternation about how the city might step in and regulate the bike shares, the whole ordeal was resolved with one simple solution: the scooter. Almost overnight, scooters bumped bike share off the streets and the hand-wringing about bike tangles was over.
Unlike the bikes, it doesn’t look like those electric scooters are a passing fad. According to a recent report by the National Association of City Transportation Officials, during the first full year after scooters first hit the streets of American cities, 38 million rides were taken. Incredibly, scooter companies are scaling faster than any new transportation innovation, including ride-share, according to this Axios analysis.
Since it seems like scooters are here to stay, it makes sense to begin to talk about regulations.
Like the bikes, there are some lingering questions about how scooters fit into Dallas’ current mobility picture. Electric scooters sometimes clog up sidewalks; street infrastructure supporting their usage is insufficient; and there have been many questions about safety and liability. So how will cities regulate their use in a way that doesn’t stifle their success?
An op-ed on Streetsblog reports that several cities have started to search for answers:

Cities have begun regulating these rapidly proliferating vehicles in a variety of ways, including imposing caps on the number of scooters allowed by each operator, speed limits, designated parking zones, and permit systems that include fees and taxes. In this vein, San Francisco stands out among its peers for the deliberate process it has taken to legalize scooter sharing. After demanding that all the scooters dropped on the street without permission be removed, the city created a permit system and awarded two of them, to Skip and Scoot. Other cities have avoided this altogether by simply banning dockless scooters (or refusing to update their regulations to allow them).

Banning scooters altogether seems like an obvious short-sighted option, given how popular they have proven to be and how valuable a role they can play in solving the so-called “last mile” public transit problem. Unsurprisingly, no one has figured out the right mix of rules and regulations yet. But that’s a good thing. What is instead happening is a series of city-by-city experiments.
 Santa Monica, for example, has designated public rights of way for bike and scooter parking. Santa Cruz has a hybrid model that permits scooters to be parked at docking stations and bike racks. San Francisco tried reducing sidewalk clutter by requiring that all scooters have locking mechanisms, and it seems to be working. The Bay City also piloted a program that allows low-income residents a break on scooter rental prices.
The advantage for Dallas is that it can sit back and watch all these cities’ experiments and determine which mix of new laws will work better here. That said, California also presents another lesson for Texas. Even as California cities are fine tuning their approach to scooter regulation, the state legislature has stepped in with a blanket bill that may frustrate many of these efforts.
Streetsblog goes into the details of the proposed state law, but the lesson for Texas is simple. Any scooter regulation should be generated by a city’s individual experience with the new technology, allowing ideas to be generated by local feedback and data-driven analysis.
Patience and local discretion. That may seem like an obvious policy disposition. But given the Texas legislatures recent penchant for stepping on cities’ toes, it is one worth repeating.

Uber was an unknown quantity when it arrived in New Zealand.
“Now it’s a verb, it’s a noun, everyone uses it and I think that that has been the evolution in terms of how it’s become integrated into people’s lives,” said Uber’s New Zealand boss Amanda Gilmore.
But Uber’s monopoly of the ride-sharing market is over – there is a new kid on the block.
Ola might be the underdog here in New Zealand, but it dominates the massive Indian market – its home base.
Brian Dewil is leading Ola’s drive into New Zealand.
He said the two founders, Bharvish Aggarwal and Ankit Bhati kept Ola in India, concentrating on securing it’s huge market share there. But in 2017 they “decided to venture out of the shores of India into international waters”.
Ola moved into Australia in 2017, the UK early 2018 and finally arrived here in November last year.
“We’ve done a lot of research into the market places and the ANZ region seemed like a good place for us to trial and to get Ola out of India,” said Dewil.
“And, particularly in New Zealand, we saw what could be argued as a monopoly in terms of where the ride-share was at with very little competition against the dominant incumbent. So, Ola being a challenger brand, familiar with that world was very keen to sort of come into New Zealand and offer a credible, safe, viable ride-share alternative.”
And they’ve come into market, as Dewil terms it, “aggressively”.
“We’ve got to get enough customers quick enough for our drivers to make a substantial living,” said Dewil, “We’ve invested very heavily into New Zealand. We’re not here to just sort of test the waters and play around.”
So, a full-scale battle has broken out for the hearts, minds and pockets of customers. And drivers.
Drivers are key. Without a critical mass of them in the right place at the right times the business model falls apart.
Ola’s strategy is to give drivers a bigger slice of the pie. The company takes a lower commission rate than Uber.
But Amanda Gilmore says driver loyalty is not all about how much drivers earn.
She explained that the ability to earn with Uber is really dependent upon time and day of the week, so Uber aims to empower drivers with information. If they know where the greatest earning opportunities are they can make the most of their time driving.
“I’ve been with Uber for almost 3 years and there’s still plenty of drivers that I run into every day that I met my first week and I don’t think that they would still be doing that if it wasn’t a compelling proposition for them,” she said.
Jimmy is one of around 8,000 Uber drivers in Auckland and reckons during the busy Christmas season, drivers can earn up to 1800 dollars a week before tax and expenses.
“But all other times they make about 1200, 1400 a week. So, after cutting all their expenses, at least everybody’s making $900 a week, which is equal to their 40 or 50 hours a week job.
And this is great, because the job also comes with flexibility.
“If I work full-time somewhere else then my wife need to stop the job or I have to end up sending my son to the childcare, where if we make another $400 extra, we might be ending up paying 2-3 hundred dollars to the childcare,” he said.
Jimmy is fairly clear about who will emerge as the winner between Uber and Ola.
“Maybe Uber will lose some jobs. But still they are the one who first started these ride-share apps, so whoever started it first, they are going to be number one, all the time.”
Jimmy’s confidence is one thing, but Uber’s not taking its head start for granted.
It’s aiming to stay number one by becoming an integral part of our urban transport systems.
Last year Uber acquired Jump electric scooters and plans to add them to it’s platform.
“In the next 12 months we’re really thinking about what are those other modes that we can bring in to market,” said Glimore, “What if you could get an electric scooter or even an electric bike or potentially you could see what buses are available and jump on a bus as well?”
Gilmore sees a future with lots of different ways of getting around so the consumer can choose a seamless experience that works best for them.
“That is really the North Star for us. Creating that whole experience in one place.”
“But we can also kind of incentivise people to take the modes that make the most sense for the city and the ecosystem. So we can try to get people onto public transport or potentially on to electric scooters and things like that,” she said.
And Auckland’s congested roads and stressed public transport has plenty of upside for Uber
“There is a ton of opportunity in first and last mile,” said Gilmore.
So, she said, instead of using overflowing Park ‘n Ride stations, people could ride-share to the bus and train stations. That might be a much more efficient solution than us having to invest in more Park ‘n Ride infrastructure.
Gilmore also thinks complementing the existing transport network could be a source of new customers for Uber.
“Potentially there are times of day buses are roaming around with really low utilisation. Is it more cost effective to do a share-ride in a smaller vehicle, like an Uber with four people. Or the opposite – is there times of day or areas where buses are at capacity and it doesn’t make sense to add another bus from a cost perspective but maybe we can get just a little added capacity from some pooled vehicles.”
She said Uber’s pooling technology has come a really long way and she’s keen to work with government on how we could bring that to New Zealand.
But is this enough to hold off Ola? Uber’s monopoly is gone and with it the idea that once you have scale you can raise prices and cash – big time.
Uber is no Google or Facebook, it faces serious competition and its battle with Ola means the riders are the winners.

Washington’s regional transit system is planning a $1 million, one-year pilot program to subsidize taxi and ride-sharing trips for Metro users between midnight and 4 a.m. when the subway system is closed.
Business leaders in Montgomery County say the service could help restaurants and other late-night workers.
Metrorail has been closing at 11:30 p.m. on weeknights and 1 a.m. on weekends for required track repairs and system maintenance and late-night bus service is limited.
“We have almost 200 restaurants in Bethesda, and many of them stay open past midnight,” said Ginanne Italiano, president and CEO of the Greater Bethesda Chamber of Commerce, who supports more options for employees who work late hours and customers of bars and restaurants. “And it’s not just restaurants, but also office workers like cleaning folks and others who do work late.”
Italiano said she recognizes that Metro needs to perform nighttime maintenance and that it isn’t realistic to expect the system to do so while returning to late-night hours.
“Metro is doing what they’re supposed to be doing … so we understood, but at the same time, it didn’t help our economy,” she said.
Similar concerns were heard voiced last month at a public forum in Silver Spring.
Stephanie Steele, who works for The Fillmore music venue and was the past chairwoman of the Greater Silver Spring Chamber of Commerce, Steele said 450 businesses in downtown Silver Spring rely on Metro.
“Simply said, Metro’s reduction of night time hours are reducing the nighttime economy,” she said.
Jane Redicker, the President and CEO of the Silver Spring Chamber, said she too had observed a suffering restaurant industry in the downtown area due to the early Metro closings.
“It’s an interesting proposal and an interesting way to help alleviate some of the challenges that some of the nighttime economy has faced with the early shutdowns,” she said of the ride-sharing idea.
Redicker said she has also spoken to a number of property owners who have had trouble attracting tenants due to the fact that Silver Spring is located on the often-delayed Red Line. She said she is looking forward to the service improvements Metro is implementing in the coming year, which includes ending turnbacks at Silver Spring and adding more trains during rush hours.
“We supported ending the turnbacks. That’ll be a big help,” she said.
Under the proposal released Wednesday, Metro would pay for the first $3 of each ride for 10 rides per week. Trips would need to take place within Metro’s service area.
Wednesday’s announcement came two weeks after the transit agency’s board voted to maintain the current early closing times of 11:30 p.m. on weeknights and 1 a.m. on weekends. The earlier closing times have been in place since 2016 to allow the transit system to perform nighttime maintianance.

Uber had planned to have as many 75,000 self-driving vehicles on its fleet in 2019, part of a broader plan to introduce a robo-taxi service in 13 American cities by 2022.
And the company was pumping money into the plan at an incredible rate, with documents tendered as part of a trade secret lawsuit brought by Google-backed rival Waymo revealing the ride-share service was spending US$20m a month on the prgram back in 2016, according to the TechCrunch website.
The report details internal modelling that shows, as of 2016, Uber predicted it driverless cars would become a profitable part to its business by 2018, with as many as 75,000 driverless vehicles on the road this year. That vision is yet to occur, of course, and Uber is now reportedly seeking a US$1b funding boost to supercharge its self-driving plans, according to reports in the Wall Street Journal.
For now, though, Uber’s driverless-car program remains in test mode, with a pilot program paused and then scaled back following a fatal accident with a pedestrian in Arizona last year.

Southeast Asia’s largest ride-hailer Grab will add public transport information to its platform as it moves a step closer to becoming a one-stop mobility app.
The new service called “Trip Planner” will integrate publicly available transport data as well as other real-time information from partner transport operators. It will be launched this week in Singapore, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur.
Trip Planner will allow users to view public transit routes, along with ride-hailing suggestions for the first and last mile of each journey, as well as alerts on delay and schedule changes for some transport options.
Initially, the new service will only display public transport information, but Grab plans to add a function to enable consumers to pay for the entire journey with once touch.
“Trip Planner is one of our first steps towards integrating Grab with public transport,” Ngiam Xinwei, head of marketplace and shared mobility at Grab, told Nikkei Asian Review in an interview, adding that Grab envisioned a future where all users had to do was “pay [for public transport] with the Grab app” and then put the phone in their pocket.
Grab is still to negotiate financial arrangements with public transport operators, and there are technical hurdles to overcome such as how users would ride on trains or buses without physical tickets.
Grab operates ride-hailing services in eight countries across Southeast Asia, and will start the Trip Planner in Singapore, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur because those cities have more developed public transport systems with easily accessible data.
The ride-hailing company has been testing Trip Planner in Jakarta since late February ahead of the launch of the Indonesian capital’s first MRT service in March. Jakarta’s MRT operator expects to attract users by tapping into Grab and other ride hailing services.
While Grab’s Trip Planner might be a boon for competing transport operators, Grab views this as being in line with its vision to help reduce congestion and push smart mobility. Trip Planner will be “a win-win for everybody involved, including the governments and us,” said Ngiam.

The streets of Dubai are abuzz with ride-hailing and -sharing platforms, and industry momentum around delivering future mobility, in line with the requirements of smart cities, has intensified after HE Sultan Al Mansouri, the UAE’s Minister of Economy, approved American giant Uber’s pending acquisition of local car-hailing app Careem in a $3.1bn (AED11.4bn) transaction earlier this month. 
Despite the odd traffic jam, I thoroughly enjoy driving and the nitty-gritty of car-ownership. However, the advancements made in the mobility sector over the last few days alone have made me wonder how much longer I will need to own a car for.
For instance, earlier this month, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) signed a memorandum of understanding with personal rapid transit developer Skytran to introduce suspended transport systems in the city. These small-sized units have a cruising speed of 160kmph, and are typically supported 20-30ft above-ground, with the system said to have the capacity of transporting more people than a six-lane highway.

Mobility may once have been a buzzword in the global design and construction sectors, but the UAE’s advancements are proving that smart cities are no longer a theoretical concept and can, indeed, be translated into economic, environmental, and social benefits in the real world.

The RTA’s and Skytran’s announcement comes at a time when, led by the UAE, hyperloop construction is becoming a reality around the world. In October 2018, it was confirmed that construction on the world’s first commercial hyperloop system – located in UAE capital Abu Dhabi – would begin in Q3 2019, with Dar Al-Handasah leading the project design of Hyperloop Transportation Technologies’ (Hyperloop TT) project.
In Dubai, DP World Cargospeed was formed in April 2018 with the aim of developing rapid-transit systems using Virgin Hyperloop One’s magnetic levitation technology to deliver goods, as well as create links between road, rail, and air transport networks.
Not too far from DP World’s head office in Jafza, construction is steadily progressing on the extension of Dubai Metro’s Red Line, called Route 2020, which links the busy passenger transport network to the Expo 2020 Dubai site.
Route 2020 spans 15km from Nakheel Harbour and Tower Station to the World Expo’s site, and comprises 11.8km of elevated and 3.2km of underground track. Rail track work for Route 2020, according to RTA’s announcement in March 2019, was 80% complete, while stations for the development were 50-60% complete.
Mobility may once have been a buzzword in the global design and construction sectors, but the UAE’s advancements are proving that smart cities are no longer a theoretical concept and can, indeed, be translated into economic, environmental, and social benefits in the real world. Dubai’s ambition to become one of the world’s smartest and greenest cities shows no signs of slowing down – if anything, it’s journey has only just begun.

A new ridesharing program set up by the Washington, D.C., Department of Public Works (DPW) aims to reduce the number of cars on the congested roads of the nation’s capital and the amount of toxic emissions coming from those vehicles. But the resulting data also could give officials additional insights.
Under an agreement with Via Transportation, announced last month, D.C. government employees can book rides for official business through the Via app. To use it, agencies opt into Via Vehicles on Demand. The company receives a list of agency employees and sets up accounts under a corporate account. Employees download the app to their smartphones and log in with a unique promo code to book rides for work purposes such as meetings. At the end of each month, Via invoices DPW for all the rides taken, and the department passes on those bills to the agencies.
Like other popular services such as Uber and Lyft, after a rider books a ride, the Via app finds and sends the closest driver to a designated location within a block of the passenger. Via can be used for shared and individual rides.
So far, 10 agencies have the service up and running, and two more have requested enrollment. The Office of Strategic Planning and Performance Management (SPPM), DPW’s data team, has been leading the Vehicles on Demand effort.
“Together with Via team, SPPM collects and analyzes program data including ridership numbers, agency participation, cost, quality of service, trip length, etc.,” DPW Director Chris Geldart wrote in an email to GCN. “The live data insights are created in various dashboards and used by our team to increase agency participation, ridership and ensure high quality of service (e.g., short wait times, driver availability in rush hours).”
Via handles data privacy and security, Geldart added. Users are authenticated, authorized and audited, and all access is verified at the packet level and logged for audit, compliance and analysis.
“Via’s databases and backend systems are distributed among the three different ‘availability zones,’ which form Amazon Web Services’ US-East-1 region in Virginia,” Geldart said. “Via’s systems are designed to handle a complete failing of two out of the three zones.” Additionally, the company has a disaster recovery plan in that its databases are backed up to Amazon’s Simple Storage Service in an encrypted format.
Besides reducing traffic and carbon emissions, DPW is also seeing cost savings from the program. A major reason for this is the company already had a presence in D.C., so the partnership makes use of existing Via drivers, said Alex Lavoie, Via’s U.S. general manager.
Via Shared — think carpool — costs 56 cents per mile, Via Private is $1.06 per mile and a taxi is $2.16 per mile. The service is also cheaper than using agency-leased or -owned vehicles through a fleet share system, which works like Zipcar’s car-sharing business model, Geldart said.
“This program uses an already existing infrastructure to transport employees, thus minimizing the need for D.C. government vehicles, which means there is no maintenance, fuel or acquisition costs,” he added.
Other benefits DPW either sees or expects include fewer parking infractions and more transportation options for work-related activities.
“Our whole system is built with the idea that you can build the technology to efficiently group people together and route them if they’re headed to destinations in the same direction,” Lavoie said. “You can create an ecosystem that works for the riders of the vehicle, the drivers of the vehicle and also the city and residents of the city in which you’re operating by taking vehicles off the road, making sure rides are efficient and aren’t going to the most congested parts of the city.”
The partnership follows a pilot test of a ridesharing program that DPW and the D.C. Department of For-Hire Vehicles conducted with local taxicab companies from June 2017 to April 2018. In that time, more than 1,000 employees at 27 agencies took 2,100-plus rides. The impetus for that test run was finding cost-effective strategies for transporting District employees without adding to the 3,000 vehicles DPW maintains and fuels.
DPW’s partnership with Via is expected to result in about a 20% savings from the resulting per-mile rate of the pilot.

China’s January light vehicle numbers are in — and they are not pretty.
(Except for electric cars. But more on that in a minute).
Overall light vehicle sales declined a stunning 18 percent year-on-year.
January 2018: 2,395,000
January 2019: 2,010,000
That’s a fall of nearly 400,000 units. If we take $22,000 as the average new vehicle transaction price, we are talking about a revenue shortfall of $880 million. In a single month.
This is China’s 7th straight down month, something the Post-Mao generation has never seen. Even at GM and its mighty partner, SAIC, sales declined 11 percent in January.
Why the sustained market weakness? Three factors:
1. Confidence: Chinese consumer confidence has been shaken by the cloud of uncertainty hanging over trade and investment relations with the United States. As the saying goes, “There is no one on earth more audacious than a Chinese when times are good. And there is no one under the heavens more cautious than a Chinese once the weather turns.”
2. P2P Lending Crackdown. At its peak, some 2,000 informal companies were channeling loans from wealthy coastal Chinese to aspiring middle class families living in inland cities. Then came a major regulatory crackdown last summer.
3. Mobility Choices. Increasing numbers of Chinese are opting for mobility as a service over car ownership. Some 550 million Chinese took 10 billion rides with Didi last year, according to company spokespeople. (That compares to 100 million users and 5 billion rides for Uber globally in 2018).
Also firing demand for mobility: Urban residents are growing tired of the costs of car ownership, including taxes, ever-increasing parking fees and insurance.
Fuel – at $4.40 per gallon – is also not cheap.
Electric Momentum
What about electric vehicles? Well, they continue to buck the market trend in a big way. Chinese automakers delivered 98,000 EVs and plug-in hybrids in January, up 120 percent from the January 2018 level.
Driving EV demand: Quotas, mandates, subsidies, tax breaks and road access policies. Also, there is rising consumer acceptance as better EV models come to market and charging stations grow nationwide.
So, if you’re sitting in Detroit or Stuttgart or Paris or Tokyo you might be asking yourself: How will the decline in Chinese car demand change my 2018 bonus, er, I mean, my company’s prospects?
German luxury: Still smiling. Mercedes, BMW and Audi achieved record sales. (The wealthy, China will always have them).
Japanese: Think spectrum. Toyota strong. Honda steady. Nissan wobbly. Mazda shaky. Suzuki already out of the game.
Americans: Hurt locker. Ford and FCA sales down more than 30%. GM off, too, but less sharply.
French. Carnage. Peugeot sales sliding 50% since 2016. Never mind a bonus. Start thinking job security.
Take: Chinese EV makers are beginning to see opportunity (and potential profits) at higher price points. Beijing Automotive’s Arcfox brand is designed to be the company’s equivalent to the Mini brand: A premium offering in a small package.
>> CATL/Honda. China’s largest EV battery maker, CATL, and Honda are teaming up on battery development.
Take: Only a few years ago, Chinese-Japanese cooperation on electrics was unthinkable. In a rivalry colored by geopolitics, China pushed electrics while Japan endorsed fuel cells. Now, there is greater flexibility on both sides.
>> Aiways. Another Chinese electric SUV is on this way to market. This time the target is Europe. The product: Aiways U5, with more than 280 miles of range.
Take: There seems to be at least one Chinese EV in all 26 Chinese provinces. The U5 is already in production at a plant in land-locked Jiangxi Province, southern China. Think Arkansas.
AUTONOMOUS
>> TuSimple. Autonomous vehicle start-up for trucks steps into unicorn status with $95 million in Series D funding, led by the Sina Corporation, owners of Weibo, the twitter of China.
Take: TuSimple, with operations in San Diego and Tucson, is one of several Chinese auto-tech firms with dual operations in China and the United States. Others include Pony.ai, Roadstar, WeRide and Baidu.
 
Quadrobot/Detroit. This last-mile delivery firm aims to develop products in Detroit then manufacture and sell in China.
Take: China is proving to be a fertile ground for autonomous driving tech.
National and local governments are paving the way into ports, airports and postal delivery services.
Remember: China is home to more than 160 cities with a population of over 1 million residents. Each city has a transportation budget.
RIDE-HAILING
>> Didi/Chile: Didi is entering Chile, in many ways South America’s most progressive economy and home to 18 million.
Take: Uber, watch your bottom flank. Didi is already well-ensconced in Brazil, after acquiring 99, a local company, in 2017. Now Didi is aiming to compete in Chile, Peru and Columbia.
NEW DEALS
>> Amazon/Automotive. Amazon invested $700 million last week in Rivian, the Michigan-based EV pickup and SUV maker. The deal comes just a week after Amazon’s “significant investment” in Aurora, the autonomous-vehicle startup.
Take: An internet giant investing in automakers? Shades of Tencent’s 2017 investments in NIO and Tesla.
>> Crunched. Apart from the TuSimple deal, Chinese investment into the United States is down significantly. Look at these Chinese-Investments-into-the-US numbers from the respected Rhodium Group:
2016: $46 billion
2017: $29 billion
2018: $4.8 billion
This does not mean business activity is grounding to a halt because the investment numbers do not count re-investments from current operations. Nor can they capture special deals like loans or licensing agreements designed to work around direct investment controls.
Nonetheless, investors are mostly holding their powder until trade and investment tensions ease.

INSHUR and Uber have partnered to offer a range of insurance services to drivers who use the Uber app.  The fully digital insurance service is one of the first of its kind.
INSHUR uses information about average trips, location and driver ratings in near real-time.  The data is then used to calculate risks and pricing, and reward safe driving with cheaper policies.
Traditionally, it has not been an easy process for drivers to purchase specialist PHV insurance. A recent survey found over half of drivers waited a day or more for their policy and 11% waited for one or two weeks*.  Drivers have to print forms, call or visit a broker’s office – all of which keep them from driving and costs money.
The INSHUR app allows drivers to log in using their Uber ID, scan their licences, select a type of cover and pay for a policy in the app.  This process takes only three minutes and drivers can make changes 24/7 and don’t need to wait for the broker to open.
The partnership also aims to reduce insurance fraud. INSHUR is the only 100% mobile PHV insurance provider in the UK meaning it is able to provide real-time digital checks without the need for manual intervention.  For example, INSHUR fraud protection is built into the application process, with automated driver validation, such as scans of both Driving Licence and Private Hire Licences.
Insurance documents are also automatically uploaded to the Uber platform as soon as a driver is covered and notifications are automatically sent if the driver is no longer insured.
Fred Jones, Director, Uber London Limited, said:
“Safety is at the heart of everything we do and motor insurance is at the heart of private hire safety. We have introduced many new safety features in the app and improved our processes over the past 18 months. However, we won’t stop there because when it comes to safety on our platform, our work is never done.”
David Daiches, Co-founder, INSHUR, said:
“We have built a data-driven technology platform, secured insurance capacity with a trusted global insurer and are scaling our business in New York and the UK.  The relationship with Uber further extends our focus on technology, data and real-time usage based risk assessment. The aim will be to reward the safe and highest rated professional drivers, this is a great thing for everyone.”

It doesn’t seem like the transportation industry could be completely disrupted by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Of course, the idea of both Lyft and Uber dominating local transportation industries across the globe seemed laughable a decade ago too.
Truly innovative technology always finds a way to seep into every aspect of our lives.
We already discussed how the blockchain is changing shipping and commercial transport of goods, but travel and consumer transport are very different industries. In fact, travel and tourism account for 10.4 percent of the global GDP.

No discussion of travel and transportation would be complete without the topic of blockchain technology. From ride sharing to municipal transportation, air travel, car rentals, and car sales, everything’s coming up blockchain.
The Blockchain-based Ride-sharing Economy
The basic ride-sharing economy created by Uber and Lyft are the most likely marketplaces to be attacked by blockchain-based startups. Although these companies save hundreds of millions of dollarsby classifying drivers as independent contractors, they truly work more like employees.
Like independent entrepreneurs who depend on services like Etsy, eBay, and Amazon to get products in front of customers, drivers depend on these two services. Uber basically acts like a marketplace that connects drivers to passengers.
Blockchain-based startup Arcade City thinks the blockchain is powerful enough to squeeze market share away from these historic unicorn companies that already disrupted an established industry. By accepting crypto payments and decentralizing the marketplace, this new app appeals not only to rideshare drivers, but to crypto miners.
Instead of electricity, you’d be trading your time and gasoline to earn ETH. Of course, Arcade City has a long way to go in balancing the supply and demand issues that come with building a two-sided marketplace. And it’s not the only blockchain headed in that direction either.
Chen Weixing, founder of Kuaidi Dache, Uber’s Chinese-based competitor, announced in mid-2018 an intent to build a blockchain-based Uber.
There’s plenty of reason to believe people want this solution. Uber is notorious for data issues, with a 2016 breach exposing the personal information of 20 million users and not being reported publicly until 2018. It also has to submit to regular FTC audits after it was revealed the company had a hidden “god mode” that let drivers stalk passengers.
A blockchain-based ride-hailing marketplace can be more secure, traceable, and efficient. And that’s just one place crypto is hitting the transportation industry.
Crypto Planes, Trains, and Automobiles
Car rental companies are set to compete with HireGo, a blockchain-based car rental startup that uses its proprietary ERC-20 HGO token to pay for car rentals in a peer-to-peer marketplace. Turo and several other companies are also competing in the peer-to-peer car rental space, and none has gotten the traction of Uber or Lyft yet.

Bus fare is one of the most-wanted uses of cryptos, with over half of people responding to a recent survey saying they believe they’ll pay bus far in crypto within a decade.
Two major bus companies in Brazil, Basil Sul and Viacao Garcia, are accepting BTC payments for bus fares. China’s largest electric bus operator recently struck a $24 billion three-year deal with Seven Stars Cloud Group to overhaul its finance services using blockchain technology.
By trusting blockchain with ticketing, bus depots from municipal to cross-country can better track vehicles for maintenance, charge passengers, route stops, and more. Train operators can benefit much the same way. Testing is currently underway in Russia on better railway supply tracking using blockchain, and it’s only a matter of time before more of the industry converts.
Blockchain-based vehicle tracking is of interest to airline companies like Lufthansa too. Not only is the technology great for airplane maintenance, but crypto is ideal for airline loyalty programs, as Singapore Airlines proved with its blockchain-based KrisFlyer program.
Expedia may have recently shunned Bitcoin, but the rest of the travel industry is on board the blockchain. Some blockchain bros are even boarding cruises.
Technology is the root of our transportation industry, and industry leaders in each section are quickly waking up to the effects blockchain will have on their industries.

In a matter of only a few years, the ridesharing apps Uber and Lyft have gone from novel ideas to core pieces of the transportation fabric in cities around the globe.
Now, both companies are poised to go public and offer shares on the stock market. But why are they going public now?
Here’s what we know.
What are Lyft and Uber offering?
Lyft announced its preliminary initial public offering price Monday — between $62 and $68 per share. The final price will be set after a “road show” with investors this week and before the company goes public March 29. Its stock will be listed on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol LYFT.
Lyft plans to offer 30 million shares of its company, with the option for investment banks to buy 4.6 million more. Some of the stocks will be reserved for the company’s cofounders The offering could raise $2 billion for the company and would set its value at as much as $23 billion.
That potential valuation is still much smaller than Uber’s, which is privately valued at $72 billion and is expected to go public next month.
Who owns the market?
Uber and Lyft have been in fierce competition for market share in the domestic ride hailing business, while also investing in new lines of businesses, including food delivery and autonomous vehicles.
Estimates on who controls the market vary. Lyft claims it now accounts or 35 percent of all rides taken. The latest estimate from Second Measure, a firm that analyzes purchases on credit and debit cards, puts that number at closer to 28.9 percent — three points higher than last year. Uber, according to Second Measure, has approximately 69.2 percent of the market. The company has increasingly relied on its food delivery business, UberEATS, to make up for slowing growth in its traditional ridesharing business.
In recent months, both companies have been offering steep discounts to their customers in an attempt to corner more of the market before they go public.
The company with the largest market share could be seen as having the best potential for investors. That will be Uber, for now, but Lyft is hoping it can show its market share is rising and could eventually surpass Uber’s.
Why go public now?
Investment money has flowed into companies like Uber and Lyft, which have the potential to grow substantially despite high upfront costs.
Since the two ridesharing giants were founded — Uber in 2009 and Lyft in 2012 — they have taken in billions of dollars in capital from investors.
At this point, said Semil Shah, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, Uber and Lyft have probably “tapped out” most of the late-stage investment firms that can supply the billions of dollars they’re seeking to cover debts and expand into new lines of business such as scooter and bike rentals. Were they to delay going public and return to existing investors for additional money, it might come with onerous strings attached, such as discounted shares in an eventual public offering.


Both companies have been offering steep discounts to their customers in an attempt to corner more of the market before they go public.

“When you have investors for 10 years, at some point you have to return the money to them,” said Santosh Rao, the head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners.
Uber has in the past allowed a limited few early shareholders to sell portions of their holdings to new investors. But even still they’ve been prevented from offloading as much as they’d like. Tech companies are notorious for maintaining a tight grip on ownership in their early days for fear of losing the freedom to make risky bets.
By heading for the stock market, existing investors get an opportunity to cash out, while the ridesharing giants gain access to a new pool of investors.
But filing paperwork for an offering doesn’t necessarily indicate either company has an urgent need to raise money. In the third quarter of 2018, Uber, which releases basic financial statements even though federal law does not require privately-held companies to do so, reported that it ended the year with $7.3 billion left in the bank.
Instead, experts said Uber and Lyft have likely looked at recent tumult in the global economy and decided they need to be prepared to go public in case the U.S. enters a recession in the next few years. A recession would make it more difficult to raise capital from investors and get a high price on their IPO.

“We’ve had the longest running bull market,” Rao said — that is, a general trend of stocks rising. “So I’m sure at the back of their minds they’re saying, ‘You know, let’s not wait until this whole ride ends and there’s a lull or a slowdown.’”
Other darlings of the tech industry, such as Snap Inc., which owns Snapchat, have gone public on a similar message: that they need to burn cash at a fast pace if they want to grow. But many of those companies struggled once they tried to turn a profit. Snap began trading in 2017 at an opening price of $17 per share. It is now trading at about $11.
Still, Rao stressed that the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain solid, and both Uber and Lyft are strong enough to withstand scrutiny by public investors.
“There’s not much else to prove on the private side,” he adds. “I think it’s the right time to get out.”
Why the companies are going public around the same time
Market conditions aside, the fact that the rivals filed their paperwork within days of one another is likely not a coincidence.
Shah, the partner at Lightspeed, said the two watch each other’s movements closely and act accordingly.


Going public can serve as a marketing tool for Uber — a signal to investors and the public that they’ve moved on from their tumultuous past.

Uber has been making efforts to improve its reputation since Khosrowshahi took over as CEO in 2017, following the ouster of Travis Kalanick. Kalanick was plagued by accusations that he fostered a culture of winning at all costs, even if that meant flouting the rule of law in cities around the world. Uber has been the subject of criminal investigations into its conduct, a problem that Lyft has largely avoided.
Shah said going public can serve as a marketing tool for Uber — a signal to investors and the public that they’ve moved on from their tumultuous past and are ready for greater scrutiny.
“Uber had its own self-inflicted wounds and stumbles,” Rao said. “It’s coming back now. They’ve straightened out their management, they’ve got the culture going in the right direction. They’d probably like the public to see that.”
Can the companies become profitable?
In 2018, Lyft brought in about $2 billion in revenue, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, and Uber processed about $48 billion in sales each year. But neither company is profitable.
Lyft reported it lost $911 million in 2018 and Uber lost $1.8 billion.
Uber has chalked that up to its investment in new lines of business, like food delivery and the development of self-driving vehicles, that it hopes could eventually generate new revenue streams.
Many experts think both companies have fundamentally sound business models and could become profitable in the near future if they pare back further investments in growth.
That’s the primary thing investors will be watching for after the companies go public, Rao said: a consistent growth in ridership along with falling expenses. If their core businesses are strong, investors will be able to stomach the losses as they invest in new products — at least for a few years, as Uber and Lyft, once they’re publicly traded, continue vying for ridesharing dominance.
Both companies have the same long term goal, Rao said: to be the last one standing. “That’s basically what this business is,” he said.

In today’s day and age, ride-sharing has become increasingly popular amongst teenagers and young adults who use the service for a variety of purposes: as a designated driver, as a convenient navigator, and increasingly, as a backup in the event that public transportation fails.
In contrast to other modes of transportation, ride-share services have done their utmost to virtually guarantee a set of commandments: fairly priced, always sober, and always safe.

Unfortunately, this has also caused a decline in public transportation, specifically the taxi.
Though taxis can sometimes be cheaper, it’s questionable whether or not they are dependable.
With one tap of your screen, you could hypothetically order one of many possible Ubers in an area. With taxis, there’s no app or definite ride.
Even major cities like New York City or Los Angeles are seeing a fall in public transportation in favor of ride-sharing. The efforts of the government to ensure that taxis stay on the road will soon not be enough. ith recent innovations in technology and ride-sharing, the demise of taxi driving is inevitable because ride-sharing receives major support and will not fail unless Uber or Lyft themselves find a way to limit driving services.
However, that hasn’t stopped taxi drivers from mounting a fierce resistance effort.
The New York City Council has proposed a new law that aims to decrease the influence of the ride-sharing industry, which has been the recipient of blame for low wages and poor traffic conditions.
According to an article by The Verge, this law would make NYC one of the first cities to ever put a maximum on the number of ride-sharing vehicles on the streets, granting favor to the marginalized taxi.
According to the New York Times, the bill was first introduced in 2015 but was abandoned after many supporters publicly backed Uber and Lyft.
The bill was brought into the rotation again in 2018, and if the legislation is approved, ride-sharing allowance will be based on “needs,” such as transportation to work or school, as opposed to “wants.” Uber employee Josh Gold, along with customers, voiced their disapproval for the legislation, stating that “the cap will leave New Yorkers stranded.”
An article by CNBC also stated that taxi drivers in London are preparing to sue Uber for 1.3 billion U.S. dollars on the account of lost earnings. Although Uber recently won the right to operate in the United Kingdom, the company’s legitimacy could soon be abolished due to lack of proper employee preparedness, like drug testing and background checks.
If Uber is unable to operate in the United Kingdom, it would be a major win for the taxi driving industry in the U.K.

Nevertheless, for those who live in residential areas like college towns and neighborhoods such as Isla Vista, the lack of widespread public transportation means that most residents are forced to use a ride-share service.
There is no doubt in the public mind that ride-sharing applications will eventually have a leg up over taxis. It may sometimes cost you more in a big place like New York City, but it is a small price to pay for efficiency and reliability. For those who urgently need transportation, Uber and Lyft are your best bet.
The only way that ride-sharing can fail is if the companies are part of a larger controversy. With the support ride-sharing has received and will continue to encounter, however, it is likely that taxi driving may become a thing of distant memory.

The race for a completely autonomous commercial taxi services has been heating up and a Chinese startup called WeRide is the latest player in it. If the latest announcement by the firm holds true, it will be launching its self-driven taxi services on the roads of China by July this year.
WeRide has chosen Guangzhou and Anqing as the two regions to initiate the service. Being the first one to do so in the country, the launch of the service will put it directly in competition with the likes of Uber and Waymo.
Though it will be lagging from the two competitors initially, simply due to the lack of data collected over a period of autonomous rides, WeRide won’t exactly be starting from scratch. The company has been conducting test rides of its autonomous taxi services since a year now with partners like Guangzhou Automobile Group and hence already has around 50 autonomous vehicles around the country.

The plan is to double the number of vehicles by the end of 2019. This will further be scaled to 500 by the end of next year and the proposed vehicle for the same would be Nissan’s electric passenger car, the Nissan Leaf.
WeRide will be starting with human drivers present in the taxis first, eventually phasing them out over a period of 2 years, once the 5G network is rolled out. The company will be introducing a smartphone app to book these cabs, which will then be able to carry the passengers to popular places in the region like the shopping malls. Prices will be similar to those of traditional taxi services as per the government regulations and the payments will be made digitally through apps and credit cards.
Interestingly, it has taken the company just two years to reach this stage. Founded by a team of 20 tech industry veterans in Silicon Valley, the startup moved its headquarters to China in late 2017 to focus more on the Chinese market. Reason? Chinese government has installed ample support systems for such developments, letting such autonomous vehicles drive almost anywhere at lower costs. This also results in more data collection for the company.
And that is why WeRide President Lu Qing is confident that they will beat Waymo to the race in a matter of around 6 months.
As for the technology used, WeRide is focusing on ‘level four’ autonomous driving, meaning that the car will only need a human driver in certain scenarios, such as heavy rains. Backing this up is surveillance system by SenseTime and GPU of Nvidia, one of its investors. The firm uses its own data center and has over 200 of its employees processing the collected data in Anqing.
WeRide chief believes that the firm is way ahead in the race than the rest of the Chinese players, simply because of the Silicon Valley workforce that they have. If this continues with the advancement of the firm in the autonomous ride sharing, it could very well be on its way for the long haul in a market that is expected to be the world’s largest for autonomous vehicles.
What would also help WeRide have an edge over its global counterparts is the leniency of Chinese government on the testing and practice of such autonomous vehicles, in contrast with the strict legislation in place in other countries like the US.

After ranking fifth in the 2018 Shared Mobility City Index (SMCI) by transportation consultant Movmi Shared Transportation Services, Vancouver dropped two spots, to No. 7, in this year’s report.
The study, by Vancouver-based Movmi, aims to assess the scope of and expansion potential for shared mobility in 20 major North American cities.
Unsurprisingly, the absence of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft contributed to Vancouver’s fall down the list—Montreal is now the top Canadian city, one place ahead of Vancouver—but it wasn’t the only reason for the drop.
According to the report, B.C.’s largest city is falling behind other municipalities in building out a range of increasingly diverse shared mobility services such as scooters, pedal-assist bikes and micro-transit (smaller transit vehicles deployed on a demand-responsive basis). Vancouver tied with Houston and two other cities for the lowest score on a measure of the current range of shared mobility services.
The study also pointed out Vancouver’s lack of peer-to-peer car sharing services, which many American cities, including Portland and Chicago, now offer.
Such services involve private owners making their vehicles available as part of a pool.
Like Uber and other ride-hailing providers, they’re currently barred in Vancouver due to provincial regulation.
However, Vancouver showed well in “commuting patterns,” tying with Washington, D.C., for first place in the category, which measures how many people in the area choose walking, cycling and public transit over cars. The report also points out that Vancouver has the world’s largest Car2gomembership base.
“Vancouverites can be rightly proud of their pioneering role as subscribers to car-sharing services. But shared mobility is increasingly about a whole ecosystem of diverse and integrated transportation modes and solutions,” Sandra Phillips, founder and CEO of Movmi, said in a release. “Ride-hailing isn’t the only thing we’re missing here, and we need to catch up with the many other North American cities that are speeding toward a wide range of new shared mobility options.”

Since it rolled out its e-scooters in Singapore in November last year, American e-scooter company Lime has seen the number of trips taken daily on its bright green wheelers increase by three fold.
Homegrown start-up Telepod also saw the number of trips taken on its e-scooters double in the last three months, while Grab, which piloted its GrabWheels service at the National University of Singapore (NUS) last November, said that the service went on to clock some “40,000km worth of rides” within a month.
These firms are among 14 operators that have submitted applications to operate sharing services for motorised personal mobility devices (PMDs), under sandbox licences with the authorities here.
Most of the 14 plan to roll out e-scooter services, with others such as 0MN1 Sharing planning to launch a seated PMD.
It signals a continued interest in the shared mobility scene here, at a time when the bicycle-sharing market is roiled with reports of Ofo’s cash crunch and its suspension in Singapore, as well as oBike’s abrupt shutdown of its operations here last year.

TODAY understands that each firm could apply to operate a fleet of no more than 500 PMDs, and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is expected to announce the results of the applications by the second quarter of this year.
Banking on young people and office workers who need to get to work “without breaking a sweat”, and taking in the “hard lessons” learnt from bicycle-sharing operators, the applicants are not held back by doubts over the viability of the bike-sharing business model.
Mr Ashwin Purushottam, 33, general manager of Lime Singapore, said that the firm is hoping to roll out 500 e-scooters under the sandbox licence.
It deployed about 50 to 100 e-scooters at Singapore Science Park 1 and 2 in the One-north area over the last three months, under a partnership with property developer Ascendas-Singbridge.
Another applicant going for the PMD sandbox licence is GoGreen Holdings. Its general manager Janice Lim, 33, believes that there is a chance e-scooters and PMDs may be more popular than bicycles.
“It takes just minutes to get the hang of riding an e-scooter… whereas not everyone knows how to ride a bicycle.”
She added that e-scooters could be a more practical option in Singapore’s climate, because users perspire less riding an e-scooter than on a bicycle.
Mr Htay Aung, 28, founder of bike-sharing firm AnyWheel, said that e-scooters could cater to women who “may not be comfortable with riding a bicycle when they are wearing a skirt”. He plans to launch e-scooter services under the brand JustScoot.
Other new players such as American mobility platform Helbiz said that Singapore’s infrastructure, especially around the central city area, allows for e-scooter services to thrive.
Mr Stefano Ciravegna, 38, head of strategy and investor relations at Helbiz, said: “(Singapore) is almost made for scooters to move around. The city is well-connected.”
HEALTHY DEMAND
Despite the predicament that some bike-sharing companies are facing, PMD operators vying for a slice of the pie are optimistic about the potential of shared transportation here, buoyed by the good demand for e-scooter services.
Since piloting its GrabWheels service at the National University of Singapore (NUS) in November, Grab said that the service went on to clock some “40,000km worth of rides” within a month.
Referring to a survey done by NUS, a Grab spokesperson said that close to 80 per cent of students on campus use its GrabWheels service at least one to four times a week.
Telepod, which saw the number of trips taken on its e-scooters double in the last three months, operates between 300 and 500 e-scooters in several areas including the Central Business District and One-north.
Mr Purushottam from Lime said that “early adopters seem to be students or individuals in their early 30s and commuters going to work”. Those aged between 18 and 60 are also able to use it quickly, he added.
PREVENTING PROBLEMS
Addressing the problems faced by bike-sharing firms, such as indiscriminate parking, Mr Purushottam said that operators have to maintain greater oversight of their vehicles since the batteries of e-scooters have to be charged. This would prevent e-scooters from “blanketing the city with no regard for regulations”.
One of 0MN1 Sharing’s directors, Mr Moises Chavez, 29, said unlike e-scooters, the bike-sharing model was based on “scaling explosively by simply dumping bikes” into the market.
“Bicycle companies did not need to invest in their own internal operational crew to rebalance and reorient the fleet. You cannot do the same with e-scooters because the batteries need to be recharged,” Mr Chavez said.
He added that the limit on fleet size under the sandbox licence will also level the playing field. “Efficient operations and high quality service” will then become the differentiators among the players, he said.
Ms Lim from GoGreen Holdings said that “shared bicycles have more parts that are likely to be tampered with”, for example missing saddles, pedals and broken chains. “We will see less of that problem in e-scooter sharing.”
With the authorities seeking to nip the spike in the number of reported accidents involving PMDs, bicycles and power-assisted bicycles on public paths, Lime acknowledged that there is some “inherent risk” in using any PMD and the onus is on the PMD providers to create that awareness of how to ride safely.
It signed a memorandum of understanding with Asian Detours, an LTA-appointed facilitator of the Safe Riding Programme, a national initiative aimed at equipping cyclists and PMD users with the knowledge and skills to ride safely.
Lime added that it will conduct pop-ups in parks and malls in the coming months.
SUSTAINABILITY, PRICING
Aware that competition and sustainability will be factors for survival, the operators said that the failure of some bicycle-sharing businesses here serves as a cautionary tale for them.

“Bicycle sharing provided some hard lessons for everyone to learn,” Ms Lim said, adding that data collected “during the sandbox licence period” will enable the LTA to study the improvements operators have to make and allow for “better policies to be created”.
The authorities are already taking a closer regulatory oversight over the roll-out of e-scooter services, compared with two years ago when shared bicycles first entered the market here.
Last November, the LTA impounded 42 PMDs from Neuron Mobility, Telepod and Beam because they were found at public places, in violation of the Parking Places Act.
LTA had granted exemptions to operators to provide such services only in specified boundaries, for example at One-north.
From a business point of view, one transport economist is unsure if the pricing of e-scooters services will be able to cover the “high costs” of operations.
Dr Walter Theseira from the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) said: “It all depends on the pricing, as e-scooter operators incur higher capital and logistics costs as (the e-scooters) require near-daily charging.”
Most of the operators now charge between S$0.15 and S$0.20 per minute.
Telepod charges users S$0.15 a minute. Lime charges S$1 to unlock rides and S$0.15 for every minute its e-scooters are used.
Dr Theseira cautioned that the influx of potential e-scooter operators signalling interest in the market could point towards a similar “speculative bubble” akin to what happened with the bike-sharing business.
It is likely that operators will try to “over-saturate the market”, the consequence being that it will be “impossible” for any operator to have enough usage to cover their costs, he added.

Over the past decade or so, the technology industry has transformed many things we used to buy as physical products into digital services we subscribe to or access on a pay-per-use basis.
Think about how we have moved from buying CDs towards paying a monthly subscription to use Spotify, or the shift from DVDs to Netflix.
Could cars be the next part of everyday life to be transformed from a physical product into an on-demand service? Some technologists and economists predict that the privately-owned car will go the way of the horse and buggy within in a decade.
In their view, only motor enthusiasts and the rich will one day own personal cars, which they will use for leisure rather than transportation.
One study in the US, for example, forecasts that private car ownership will fall by as much 80% by 2030 and that using electric ride-shares will be four to 10 times cheaper than buying a new car by 2021.
The researchers foresee a world where communal, autonomous (self-driving) electric cars owned by cities or ride-sharing companies offer a safe, efficient and flexible personal transportation system.

We’re already at the beginning of this revolution, with ride-hailing services like Uber and Taxify already potentially cheaper for some people than owning a car.
Car sharing services such as Zipcar – which enables you to subscribe by the month and then hire a car by the hour – and Turo – an Airbnb-like service that matches car owners with car renters – have also started to pop up around the world.
MyTreasury.co.za crunched the basic numbers and found using Uber could be more cost-effective on a per-kilometre basis for people in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban who travel less than 50 kilometres a day.
The reason for this is that you pay only for the distance you travel, without the costs of car ownership such as maintenance, insurance, financing, licences, and depreciation.
One also needs to add to the lifestyle costs. How much of your time do you spend stuck in traffic or looking for parking? What if you could be making calls and working on your computer during your commute instead of sitting at the wheel?

A new report from Allison+Partners, a global marketing and communications agency, suggests that changing definitions of transportation and an influx of new mobility solutions are paving the way for the birth of a new culture—the mobility culture.
Resulting from the intersection of transportation and technology, this cultural shift will be driven forward by the new generation of consumers just now coming of driving/ride-sharing age.
Much in the way Baby Boomers in their teens and twenties defined American car culture, Gen Z will ultimately become synonymous with mobility culture, the PR firm says. The study, “The Birth of Mobility Culture,” also explores implications for brand marketers as consumer values shift from “me” to “we” and access to new mobility options increase.
The report, based on a survey of US consumers fielded in January 2019, reveals a clear shift in consumer attitudes, values and behaviors between generations and with more transportation options available than ever before.
Key findings that highlight this shift include:

Cars remain at the center of today’s transportation equation, but how they’re used is changing. While roughly 70% of licensed Americans drive their vehicles daily, 38% of those without a driver’s license say they have no need for one. With Gen Z, the numbers become even more significant—nearly 70% of Gen Z respondents do not have their driver’s license and 30% of those who do not currently possess their driver’s license have no intention or desire to get one.
Car culture shifts from “me” to “we.” Younger generations, including Gen Z, have begun to see automotive benefits that move beyond convenience to relaxation and social experiences. When asked why they would purchase an autonomous vehicle, Gen Z consumers cited relaxation as a primary factor (65%)—almost equal to convenience (67%).
Technology and transportation have become synonymous. The excitement for autonomous technologies is driven by Gen Z, due largely to a high trust level with technology. Ultimately, 60% believe they will use autonomous vehicles by 2029.


Not only will the car itself change drastically with the advent of new technology and mobility solutions, but its role in our lives and in culture will also evolve. Our automotive practice was born out of an authentic passion for disruptive brands that are redefining mobility, with a deep understanding that the most important attributes of transportation for consumers are trust and loyalty.
—Marcus Gamo, Senior Vice President and Automotive Specialty Group Lead at Allison+Partners

The report also reveals that despite changing American consumer values and behaviors, brands remain more relevant than ever. For marketers, however, the introduction of this new mobility culture will require a revamped approach to effectively garner consumer loyalty and advocacy:

Reinforce how technology enhances the experience. With consumers conditioned to expect technology innovation at a faster rate than the traditional new vehicle introduction timeline, it’s important for marketers to reinforce how technology features enhance the ride experience, contribute to vehicle safety and support a future where transportation options come together in concert.
Demonstrate an understanding of the shift from “me” to “we.” It will be more important to underscore the benefits of a particular mobility option to communities of people (such as a city, university or corporate campus), rather than to just individual drivers.
Focus on building relationships during the journey, not at the finish line. Younger consumers value authentic relationships with brands, and it takes time to foster that trust. Understand their values, what advancements in automotive technology excite them and, equally important, their concerns about the future of mobility. Use this information to inform how to communicate and engage with them about your brand.
Consider new avenues for introducing mobility options. The traditional auto show has been the core of how automakers, motorcycle brands, RV makers and others have introduced new vehicles to a rabid group of automotive enthusiasts. Due to this shift in values and attitudes, marketers must now plan for more values-based, communal and experiential local market activations, where influencers help create and share the story and consumers can experience brand value in a real and authentic way.


As consumer relationships with cars evolve, automotive and transportation industry marketers must change how they engage with younger audiences, especially Gen Z.

IMAGINE A FUTURE IN WHICH IT IS MORE convenient and less costly to own a subscription to a ride-share service not unlike Uber or Lyft to get around, rather than owning a car. No searching crowded parking lots for a space. No dealing with insurance companies, stopping for gas, or regular maintenance. Perhaps no human driver at all.
In this future of mobility, the city you live in provides on-demand access to autonomous vehicles that are seamlessly integrated into a complete system of transportation, one that is friendly to walking, biking, scooters and probably solar-powered golf carts, too. In other words, anything that lessens dependence on personal vehicles though does not preclude using them — perhaps just for pleasure, a ride behind the wheel of a genuine 20th or early 21st century antique.
Who knows how long it will take to get there or if the future will look quite like this? That depends in part on how quickly technology advances along with markets’ and governments’ ability to fold it in to traditional practices. But it is a future that Babcock Ranch planners have envisioned and that the city’s developer, Kitson & Partners, is reaching toward with its autonomous and electric vehicles, bike-share program and a “smart community app” that will help residents access transit services.

Babcock Ranch Transportation Services is beginning to build a transit system in this city that one day expects to hold some 50,000 people. The BRTS board is made up of two Kitson employees and two employees of Transdev, a transportation technology company that describes itself as the largest private provider of multiple modes of transport in North America.
“They’re really our operating partners when it comes to running a transit system,” said Tom Hoban, BRTS board member and Babcock Ranch president and CIO.
The BRTS board is keeping an open mind about any alternative modes of transportation that could play a role in an integrated system that helps reduce dependence on personal vehicles, Mr. Hoban said. The long-term vision, he added, is that BRTS “is truly a transportation service … That’s a bike share, a Zip car (an Avis car subscription service), autonomous vehicles, scooters, you name it.
“But it’s anything other than just jumping in your car and driving yourself.”
In the near term, he suggests, homeowners might be able to manage their needs with one vehicle instead of two and benefit from substantial savings on both cost and convenience as a result. In the long-term, they might not need to own car at all.
Early suggestions of what is to come are found within two autonomous shuttles at Babcock Ranch. Built by EasyMile, they are used to carry potential homebuyers out to view model homes. BRTS is looking toward expanding the use of autonomous vehicles to practical uses for residents.
“I think the point of moving from the marketing side of it to the real practical, on-demand use of it is a really critical step we’re taking right now,” Mr. Hoban said. “We’re really excited about it.”
Along with Transdev and Levatas, a tech company focused on software development, they are creating a comprehensive community app called Key- Link that will allow residents to hail a ride or have groceries delivered to their doorstep. Its numerous other features will include a virtual concierge. A group of Babcock Ranch residents are currently being recruited to help test the app’s transportation services before an initial version is released, possibly later this year.
A team of designers at Levatas created the look and practical features of the app, such as a feature that will allow residents to use systems such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home to hail a ride by voice command. At least in its initial phase, the technology is designed specifically to be used inside Babcock Ranch.
“(It) is a great area to roll it out because it’s a controlled environment with limited variables,” said Brian Dunnam, chief technology officer of Levatas.
Suggestions of what is to come are found in the town’s new paid bike-share program, one of the first of its kind in Southwest Florida (though it has long been in practice in Punta Gorda, West Palm Beach and Miami and other U.S. metropolitan areas).
And it is built into Babcock’s overall design, its bike lanes and pathways, if not yet its parking lots and the two-car garage designs on some of its single-family homes. Government rules and market needs still require certain provisions that might not be necessary in the future of mobility, which requires flexible planning. For instance, if customers are taking an autonomous shuttle to the grocery store, that store might not need four spaces per 1,000 (square feet). Maybe you only need one or two.
“It’s very early in this revolution of the transportation industry,” Mr. Hoban said. “But my point is you need multiple components growing in the same direction to really effectuate wholesale change…
“You try to plan with as much flexibility as you can to capitalize on the change that’s coming.”
Kitson & Partners is not original in this vision for transportation in coming years, although the company is unique in being able to incorporate it from the ground up in a city built from scratch. The ideas are found in decades-old mobility movements within the architectural and real-estate practices of New Urbanism, in the official state-adopted policy of roadway design called Complete Streets, and the increasingly trendy practice of transportation-oriented design — ideas that dovetail with the movement to “go green” and to embrace green technologies, to live healthier lifestyles, and with the environmental consciousness that has from the beginning been behind Syd Kitson’s vision for the town, with its large swaths of preserved land, “ranch-to-table” community garden and, of course, the vast solar field that supplies its power.
The town’s innovative approach to transportation might be considered by other cities and businesses in the future, said Greg Lindsay, director of applied research at the Montreal-based think tank NewCities Foundation.
“One future of mobility is you don’t own a vehicle,” he said. “Your employer has a fleet of shuttles. Or the mall does. Or your multi-family apartment building has a service.”
Or Babcock Ranch provides it, powered by its solar field.
“I think cities could learn from (Babcock Ranch) in the sense that they’re doing real-world testing,” Mr. Lindsay said.
Some of Babcock Ranch’s real estate development, built with this future of mobility in mind, could reflect what he calls “urbanized suburbs.” That is, areas that might not be near the downtown core of a city, but at the same time are not only the typical bedroom communities of “white picket fences and cul-de-sacs and two-car garages” that many envision when they hear that word.
Instead, they might be made up of mixed-use commercial and residential property that provides a more vibrant lifestyle or have easy walking and biking access to them, something Babcock strives to offer residents as it plans for an evolving world of transportation. ¦

SoftBank Group Corp Chief Executive Masayoshi Son blasted Japan on Thursday (July 19) for not allowing ride-sharing services, calling it “stupid” and saying the country was lagging overseas rivals in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI).
“Ride-sharing is prohibited by law in Japan. I can’t believe there is still such a stupid country,” Mr Son said at an annual company event aimed at customers and suppliers.
The comments reflect Mr Son’s frustration with Japan, where he built SoftBank’s domestic telecoms business, the cash engine that has powered his investments.

The group has, however, focused its growing range of technology investments overseas.
Mr Son has also been highly critical of the government previously when SoftBank was still a fledgling telecoms service trying to break up a cosy duopoly in Japan.
“A country that gives up on the future has no future,” Mr Son told attendees at the SoftBank World event, saying Japanese business is lagging behind countries such as the United States and China in employing AI.
Japan outlaws non-professional drivers from transporting paying customers on safety grounds and the country’s taxi industry lobby has vigorously opposed deregulation.
Its strict rules have confined ride-sharing firms to providing limited services, with SoftBank and China’s Didi Chuxing saying on Thursday they will trial a taxi-hailing service – matching users to pre-existing taxi operators – in Osaka beginning autumn of 2019. Uber is also piloting a taxi-hailing service.
When asked for a response to Mr Son’s comments, a spokesman for the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport said that an issue with ride-sharing services was that while the driver was in charge of transporting passengers, it was unclear who was in charge of maintenance and operation.
“The ministry believes that offering these services for a fee poses problems from the points of both safety and user protection, and careful consideration is necessary,” he said.
HOME-SHARING CURBS
Ride-sharing is not the only service in Japan feeling the impact of government restrictions. Strict new rules on home-sharing came into force last month that have radically reduced the number of lettings on sites such as Airbnb Inc.
The curbs on Japan’s nascent sharing economy come despite a rapid rise in the number of inbound tourists likely to access such sharing services, and at a time when Japan is wanting to show its international face ahead of hosting the Rugby World Cup next year and the Summer Olympics in 2020.

While Mr Son, an ethnic Korean born in Japan, has at times criticised the Japanese government, he can also be politically suave.
He has praised US President Donald Trump with warm words and pledged to invest billions of dollars and create thousands of jobs in the United States.
SoftBank and its nearly US$100 billion (S$137.18 billion) Vision Fund have invested in ride-sharing firms Uber Technologies Inc, Didi, India’s Ola and South-east Asia’s Grab, as well as in other technology companies.
The event on Thursday saw presentations from executives at portfolio companies including Didi, General Motors’ autonomous vehicle unit Cruise and India digital payments firm Paytm E-Commerce Pvt Ltd.
Artificial intelligence is the common thread linking these companies, Mr Son said, with that technology in the future able drive vehicles, diagnose diseases and power financial services.

Business travellers around the world feel marginally safer in taxis than in ride-sharing services, according to research commissioned by Carlson Wagonlit Travel, the global travel management company.
Around two in five (39%) business travellers surveyed said they feel somewhat or very vulnerable about their personal safety in ride-sharing services, compared with 36% for taxis.
Business travellers from Asia-Pacific are the most concerned overall: 43% feel worried using ride-sharing services and 39% when taking a taxi. In the Americas, the numbers are 40% and 39% respectively, and in Europe 34% and 28%.
“In cities across the globe, using ride-sharing services has become a way of life,” said Bindu Bhatia,managing director, Asia-Pacific, Carlson Wagonlit Travel. “The familiar and convenient experience they provide has made them a preferred mode of transport for many business travellers. Still, one continues to hear about safety incidents surrounding ride-sharing services around the world, which might explain in part why some travellers are worried about using them.”
Female business travellers in Europe and Asia-Pacific are more likely to feel nervous about personal safety in ride-sharing services or taxis than men.
Looking at ride-sharing, 56% of Asia-Pacific women feel very/somewhat nervous versus 38% of men. For taxis, that is 48% and 35% respectively. In Europe, the differences are less pronounced. For ride-sharing, the numbers are 38% for females versus 31% for males. For taxis, it is 36% versus 22%. In the Americas, there is no statistical difference between genders.
Even though ride-sharing is associated with the younger generation, the findings show that these travellers are more concerned about personal safety. Millennials, in all regions, are the most worried, followed by gen X travelers and baby boomers.
In Asia-Pacific, half of the millennial travellers are very/somewhat concerned when using a ride-share service, followed by 44% of gen X and 35% of boomers. In the Americas, the percentages are 47% for millennials, 42% for gen X and 29% for boomers. In Europe, the numbers drop to 44%, 34% and 21%, respectively.
These differences might be down to gender. According to the research, gender differences appear to track the differences seen between generations. This may be because males are more likely to travel for business the older they get, but the opposite is true of female business travellers. The younger women are, the more likely they are to travel for business.
The sharing economy presents both opportunities and challenges for corporate travel programs. In some cities ride-sharing services can be considerably cheaper than taxis or car rental services, while also providing greater convenience to travellers. On the other hand, traveller safety and the legality of these services in various markets remain important concerns. As a result, corporate travel policies around the sharing economy can vary widely from one company to the next.
“Ride-sharing services may be right for some corporate travel programs but not for others,” said Bhatia. “Whether the sharing economy is a good fit for a company will depend on their company culture, their traveller demographics and their risk management policies, among other things. Either way, companies should create travel policies that define if, when and how travellers can use these services, and communicate these clearly to their employees.”

Through its ReachNow mobility unit, BMW is offering both ride and car sharing services through a single app, allowing users to choose whether they want to drive a car or hail a ride to a destination. In addition to on-demand car service, the app also allows users to schedule a pick-up for later, all using the ReachNow app.
“From day one, we’ve said that car sharing alone isn’t enough to solve the transportation challenges facing major cities. There are plenty of use cases for how people take advantage of a matrix of transit solutions – from bikes and buses to ride share and ferries – to make their way around their world every day,” said Dr. Simon Broesamle, Chief Customer Officer at ReachNow.
“As the first company to bring together car sharing and ride hailing into one app, the new ReachNow experience is an important step in our commitment to a multimodal future.”
This newest iteration of the ReachNow app is being offered to customers in Seattle. The “Drive” portion of the software provides free-floating car sharing allowing users to drive themselves to their destinations.  The “Ride” portion of the app resembles other ride hailing services.
Shared fleet
BMW says that using the same cars in a sharing app will lead to greater utilization of the existing fleet rather than adding new vehicles to the road.  “For mobility services, a key metric is the number of trips a member takes with a service,” says Dr. Bernhard Blättel, Vice President Mobility Services BMW Group.

“ReachNow’s multimodal service offering gives members more choice in how they get where they need to be by seamlessly integrating multiple services into one app.
We believe this approach is critical to increasing loyalty, as members have no need to look elsewhere for their mobility needs.”
If members choose the drive app, they can select from BMW, BMW i and Mini vehicles in the ReachNow fleet and pay by the minute, hour or the day. They can schedule a vehicle pickup as soon as 20 minutes or up to 7 days in advance.
Once a car is held, the destination is set on the in-car navigation. Members can also engage features like “Park & Keep” if they have additional need for the vehicle or “End Trip.” Rates vary from 45 cents per minute, $15 for the first hour, $50 for three hours and $80 per day. Parking time is billed at 10 cents per minute during paused trips.
Riders can also use the app to personalize the comfort by selecting temperature and music preferences of their hailed ride as well as a “quiet time” feature for those who do not want to be disturbed during their trip.
Existing members who have the ReachNow mobility app can upgrade to the new Ride services by doing an update and new members can waive the $15 sign-up fee. ReachNow Ride pricing starts at $3.24 minimum per ride incurred at $2.40 per mile plus 40 cents per minute with no surge pricing. BMW will also be testing the Drive only portion of the app in New York City and Portland, Oregon.

More individuals in larger cities may decide to utilize ride sharing services as opposed to owning a car in the future, but that does not seem the case for people who live in suburban and rural areas.
It’s a lifestyle choice, said Benard Swiecki, director of automotive communities at the Center For Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Ride sharing is a car service that allows a person to use a smartphone app to arrange for a ride in a privately owned vehicle instead of a taxi. The advantage is it’s much cheaper than a taxi for a consumer, and possibly even an alternative to owning a car.
“Your conventional Lyft and Uber services are in major cities,” said Swiecki. “There is a growing usage of those services, however, it is not available in all cities and it does not make sense outside of fairly larger metropolitan areas. It really depends on where the consumer lives and their lifestyle.”

The more urban the area, the more likely an individual will be to use ride sharing or use unconventional rental companies like Zipcar, according to Swiecki. Through Zipcar they can use a vehicle for a designated amount of time and return it when they are finished without going through a rental agency.
“These are all good replacements for owning your own car,” said Swiecki. “However, if you use your car a lot as most people who live in the suburbs, rural areas and little towns do, it just would make more sense to own your own vehicle.”
Lyft, the national ride sharing company, believes that ride sharing does have a significant impact on car ownership.
“Ride sharing has challenged the idea of owning a car,” according to Gwen Belomy, Lyft spokesperson. “Lyft is playing its part to enact change by allowing people to share rides, drive less, own fewer cars, and more easily connect with public transit routes.”
Through Lyft’s annual economic impact report, it found that in 2017 a quarter million people gave up their car and 25 percent of Lyft passengers view a personal vehicle as low in importance to them.
“At Lyft, we believe in building cities around people, not cars,” according to Belomy. “By reducing individual car ownership and sharing the ride, Lyft is working towards a future where transportation ushers in positive changes in our communities and cities. We’re making a strong commitment to shared rides with a goal of 50 percent of our rides being shared by 2020.”

If there is a way to save cost, then a majority of the Indian consumers will try to check it out. That’s been one of the more important ways in which ride sharing apps have been able to grow in a country like India.
The cost benefits to travelling with strangers far outweighs any potential problems arising from trust or theft. The route is typically the same, if you’re commuting to and from work, and the journey burns a lot of petrol.
Now with the price of petrol almost reaching Rs 82 per litre, drivers must be vying for ride-sharing apps in large numbers. Although there are distributed players in the industry, there isn’t any one competitor that’s shining through the cycle.

Unlike Uber and Ola, ride-sharing apps don’t share the same popularity or marketing budgets to reach mass audiences. Right now, their best bet is word of mouth and cost-incentives.
That’s where BlaBlaCar comes in. With it’s ride-sharing community, it has the power to change the way that Indians think about comfortable travelling. Take for example a typical journey from Mumbai to Pune.
The ride will cost you around Rs 350, whether you travel from BlaBlaCar or via an inter-city bus. With the BlaBlaCar, you can request scheduled stops, have pleasant company and be dropped exactly where you need to. There is also a GPS-enabled ride tracking app for increased security and tracking. You have complete control even though you’re riding with a stranger.
More broadly, if we look at the ride-sharing concept from a taxi-aggregator point of view, the cost benefits are immense. With Uber and Ola offering pool-share rides for a few years now, customers are quite accommodating within the crowd of a pull vehicle. With the added incentive of air-conditioning and confirmed rides, there is little incentive for them to coopt other methods.
“We have seen a high uptake for the category on both the customer as well as the driver partner side. Cities such as Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kolkata are the biggest users of Ola Share,” said Vishal Kaul, COO Ola.
A recent Uber and BCG report showed that congestion is going to cost the top four cities in India upwards of $22 billion a year. With more cars being introduced to tier-2 cities as well, that problem is going to mount over time. With the availability of ride-sharing, the propensity to purchase a low to mid-tiered vehicle also goes down.
As is the case with space utilization, there is also a significant trend of reduction in dedicated parking spaces as more people prefer to ride-share.
For these app companies, there is profitability in movement. The more the demand for the apps, the more these cars are constantly moving around. A dead-stop vehicle or one that hasn’t been activated for a long period is a waste to the system.
For Uber and Ola, it’s about 30% of all rides, but the trend continues to go upwards indicating that more Indians want to try these services at an affordable shared-rate.
“With carpooling, Ola and Uber are getting customers who would not otherwise use their services on a daily basis because of the prices. So, the companies are getting access to a set of customers who are cost-conscious, do not use a cab on a daily basis and instead use a bus or an auto rickshaw. Most of these consumers are young professionals.

Over time, they will graduate from using a shared car to booking an entire cab, which makes it a brilliant strategy to onboard new customers, said Sreedhar Prasad, partner, e-commerce and start-ups, KPMG India.
All in all, the demand for these ride-sharing apps is increasing and the country is running on it daily.
When it comes to the smaller players, there’s Ride which is offering a social carpooling experience. They even work with leading companies to take care of their transportation needs as well. For commuters, concepts like these make a lot of sense as they traverse the same route more than five times a week.
“The payment aspect is a one-to-one deal between the driver and the person availing the ride. However, at Rs 3/km, it is as cheap as using a public transport, yet offering the convenience of a car,” said Nitin Chaddha, Business Development Officer of sRide.
There’s also ToGo, Ridely and a host of smaller players that offer a social riding experience. They haven’t yet taken scale, the way that traditional aggregators have and are still trying to find that next big leap.
This could be an indication as to the trust factor for many Indians, who would rather befriend a few colleagues and ride-share individually. However, for travelers going inter-state and for those who aren’t able to travel with others, it’s a great way to save cost and protect the environment.

General Motors has plans to commercialize the self-driving car in 2019 in the form of a ride-sharing service. However, there’s no concrete plan on how that service will look just yet.
GM CEO Mary Barra commented on the self-driving car ride-sharing service at an Axios event and told the audience the company is keeping its “options open.”

“We’ll deploy the technology in an urban environment, a ride-share environment, next year.
We’ve said we’re either going to do that on our own [or] we’re going to do that with one or more partners. We’re keeping our options open right now,” she said.
GM previously invested in ride-share service Lyft for a network of self-driving cars in 2016. The automaker has since dissolved the partnership but retains its $500 million investment. It’s unclear who GM could potentially partner with for its self-driving car service as many services are also working toward commercializing the technology.
The automaker’s work comes from GM Cruise, formerly Cruise Automation. GM purchased Cruise for a reported $1 billion in 2016 as a way to bolster its self-driving car program. The unit has worked quickly to bring numerous prototype cars to life. The most-recent prototype doesn’t feature a steering wheel or pedals, called the Cruise AV.
Thus far, GM has not received the OK from the federal government to test the Cruise AV since it does not comply with traditional vehicle standards, i.e., bear a steering wheel and pedals. The company continues to test other self-driving car prototypes with a safety driver behind the wheel in various cities across the U.S.

During GM’s second-quarter earnings call, Barra also said the automaker could one day license out its self-driving car technology.
“The key thing is to get the technology developed safely so we can deploy and validate that. And once we do that, we’re going to look at any and all opportunities to really ramp up and maximize the use of the technology to drive shareholder value,” she said.
Thus, GM could one day become a supplier for self-driving car technology.

California recently became the first state in the nation to regulate the transportation pollution produced by the surge in popularity of ridesharing after Gov. Brown signed Senate Bill 1014, a bill requiring transportation network companies (TNCs) to account for, and reduce, the greenhouse gas emissions of their operations.
The explosive growth of ride-hailing companies has left states facing a growing list of unintended consequences caused by on-demand transportation companies like Uber and Lyft.

S.B. 1014, sponsored by Assembly Member Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley), requires state regulators to quantify emissions from ridesharing vehicles and set emission targets for TNCs, while requiring companies to develop plans to reduce those emissions.

By prioritizing trips made in zero-emission vehicles, ridesharing companies can help popularize clean transportation, and help California meet its goal. Studies show ride-hailing services have grown at the expense of public transit use and walking and biking.
In San Francisco, it’s estimated that TNC companies produce the same amount of greenhouse gas emissions as 100,000 households in a year. That’s a big problem in California, where transportation emissions, the largest source of emissions in the state, have hit their highest level in 10 years and are threatening the state’s ability to meet its climate goals.
A new national study found that in nine major metro areas, TNCs have added 5.7 billion miles of driving annually. Brown signed the bill aboard a plug-in hybrid electric ferry in San Francisco Bay as part of a package of legislation aimed at boosting zero-emissions vehicles and getting dirty cars and trucks off the road.
“Whether we travel by car, bus or boat, the need to move to zero-emission transportation is urgent,” said Brown.

In an age of collaborative consumption, the booming sharing economy is spurring car rental giant Avis Budget Group to navigate creative ways to grow the size and share of the travel pie through the inking of partnerships with multiple peer-to-peer car sharing players.
The latest to sign a multi-year deal with Avis is ride-hailing company Lyft. Under this partnership, Avis will contribute thousands of vehicles from its fleet of 600,000 to the Lyft Express Drive programme in cities across North America.
In Asia-Pacific, Avis has launched various strategic initiatives with popular local ride-sharing players, including China’s Didi Chuxing and Singapore’s Grab. Avis Philippines – together with Avis Global and Metro Davao Taxi Association – also developed Hirna, a taxi-hailing app that aims to improve taxi services in key cities outside Manila.
Angeline Tang, Avis’ regional director – leisure travel & partnerships, Asia, told TTG Asia: “Ride-hailing companies are our allies, not competitors. The more opportunities consumers have for mobility that do not involve owning their own car, the more we benefit.
“As this decline in ownership continues, the future holds a greater need for more, and more flexible mobility options, which explains why the pie is getting bigger, not shrinking or just being divided up differently.”

On average, Avis reports mileage of some 724km over four rental days, or 177km per rental day. In comparison, on shorter-length rentals – lasting over one to two days – the mileage per day increases, described Tang.
Such cases, for which ride-hailing are not economical, are where car rentals come in, she said.
Avis also works with Luxury Retreats, acquired by Airbnb in February 2017, as the official mobility partner of the full-service premium villa rental company.
Further, in 2013, Avis acquired car-sharing network Zipcar, which has more than one million members across the world. This movement is poised to give Avis “a foothold in the rapidly growing world of collaborative consumption”, explained Tang.
She added: “By working with ride-hailing players, we can address the growing demand for transportation in key markets, and further leverage our assets.”

In a study, the researchers used two types of neural networks—computational systems modeled on the human brain—that analyzed patterns of taxi demand. This deep learning approach, which lets computers learn on their own, could then predict the demand patterns significantly better than current technology.
“Ride sharing companys like Uber in the United States, and Didi Chuxing in China, are becoming more and more popular and have really changed the way people approach transportation,” says Jessie Li, associate professor of information sciences and technology at Penn State. “And you can imagine how important it would be to predict the taxi demand because the taxi company could dispatch the cars even before the need arises.”

Better predictions could lessen the time taxis idle waiting for rides, making cities cleaner, the researchers add. Because accidents tend to happen more often in congested areas, better ride prediction technology could also improve safety.
REQUESTS, NOT JUST RIDES
The researchers analyzed a large dataset of ride requests to Didi Chuxing, one of the largest car-hailing companies in China, according to Huaxiu Yao, doctoral student in information sciences and technology and lead author of the paper.
When users need a ride they first make a request through a computer application—for example, a mobile phone app. Using these requests for rides, rather than relying solely on ride data, better reflect overall demand, according to the researchers.
“This is really good data because it’s based on demand,” says Yao. “If you just know how many people took a ride, that doesn’t really tell you the demand because it could be that people didn’t get a ride, or others just gave up trying.”
With the historical data, which includes the time and location of the request, the computer can then predict how the demand will change over time. When visualized on the map, the researchers could see that evolving demand.

“In the morning, for example, you can see that in a residential section there are more pickups, and there are more drop-offs in the downtown area,” says Li. “In the evening, it’s reversed. What we are doing is using historical pickup data to predict how this map changes 30 minutes from now, one hour from now, and so on.”
The researchers, who presented their findings at the recent AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, used data on taxi requests in Guangzhou, China, from February 1 to March 26, 2017. Guangzhou residents make about 300,000 ride requests each day. By comparison, there are about 500,000 rides per day in New York City.
LET THE COMPUTER DO IT
While technology uses one type of neural network, the researchers combined two neural networks—the convolutional neural network, or CNN, and Long Short Term Memory network, or LSTM—to help guide the complex sequences of predictions. CNNs can better model complex spatial correlations and LSTMs can better handle sequential modeling.
“Basically, we used a very complicated neural net to simulate how people digest information, in this case, the image of the traffic patterns,” says Li.
Li says access to larger data sets—”big data”—and advances in computer technology that can process this large amount of data have helped this project and enabled other deep learning developments.
“In traditional computer programming, people need to tell the computer what aspects—or features—it needs to look at and then they have to model it, which takes a huge effort,” says Li. “Why deep learning is revolutionary is now we can skip that step. You can just give the computer the images, for example. You don’t need to tell the computer what it needs to look at.”

This week, New York City legislated to require a minimum pay rate for ride-share drivers  — the result of a two-year campaign by the Independent Drivers Guild.
This massive mobilisation of drivers in New York could foreshadow what’s to come in Australia, which, for now, is one of the only profitable markets for Uber.
An estimated 15,000 Australian Uber drivers disconnected from Uber on Monday to protest against company policies, including low commissions.
The New York City Council voted for a package of bills aiming “to regulate the for-hire vehicle industry”. It creates a new licence for “high-volume for-hire service”  — that’s companies serving over 10,000 trips a day.

This licence is accompanied by new regulatory powers given to the Taxi and Limousine Commission, including a one-year moratorium on new licences. This is a significant development in an already crowded market, and a first step in addressing concerns about traffic congestion and driver waiting times.
Most significantly, the commission will set minimum payments for drivers operating under the new high-volume licence, and potentially implement minimum payments for existing licences.
Technically, this is not minimum wage legislation. However, the introduction of regulation of the number of vehicles and of a minimum payment is a significant shift.
It could end the current race to the bottom.
At the moment, ride-share companies are competing with each other by saturating the market. They are hiring as many new drivers as they can, reducing the commission they pay to drivers and mechanically limiting the “surge” price periods when rides are more expensive because of high demand.
With fewer drivers on the road and a minimum price, drivers might actually be able to start making a decent living. It might also lead to a shift to competition on quality of service rather than quantity and price, benefiting the customer.
But the end of the race to the bottom doesn’t necessarily mean ride-sharing companies will disappear. They might just have to reconsider their business models and accept they need to provide sustainable services.
People power
The Independent Drivers Guild was created in May 2016 following negotiations with Uber and represents the 65,000 New York City drivers.
The guild’s advocacy activities include, among other things, petitions (16,000 signatures on the most recent one), phone and email campaigns, and demonstrations, including a funeral caravan aimed at scuttling an initial bill before the city council that would have imposed fees on individual ride-share drivers.
The guild also successfully lobbied the Taxi and Limousine Commission to require Uber to add a tipping option to its app. This option was later implemented across the United States.
The New York legislation shows mobilisation in the gig world is possible  — it serves as a strong encouragement for the growing Ride Share Drivers United, one of the Australian equivalents of the New York Guild.
 

Ride Share Drivers United’s “No Uber Monday!” led to a 1,200-person strike in April 2017 and 15,000 drivers logging off on Monday.
This triggered a prompt reaction from the Fair Work Ombudsman, who informed Ride Share Drivers United of progress in the current investigation of pricing and the introduction of UberPool  — a recently introduced service where riders share a car.
The recent strike was supported by the main competitors Ola and Didi, which provided incentives to drivers to log onto their apps during the strike. Ola and Didi have not applied the same controversial upfront pricing policy as Uber, meaning competitors are starting to perceive that the business model needs to be more sustainable.
The New York City legislation is a tangible move away from acceptance of a ‘free market’ approach to digital platforms  — that holds that if there is a market for a service it should be allowed at any cost  — to a demand for fairness. That means if a market does not provide for socially acceptable outcomes, it should not be allowed or should be regulated to moderate its excesses.
This could be the start of a new era where regulation of the gig economy allows for the right balance between flexibility and sustainability.

New York City is the first major U.S. city to limit private companies from providing ride-share services to customers as cities and states across the country debate how to regulate the growing industry.
The New York City Council last month voted to limit the number of ride share vehicles provided by companies such as Uber and Lyft. The two companies provide the greatest number of such transportation services, but at least 10 other companies are emerging in the high-tech areas of San Francisco Bay,  Austin, Texas, and elsewhere.
Ride-share services, which have grown in popularity in metropolitan areas, allow commuters to choose peer-to-peer car services like carpooling and car sharing as an alternative to using public transportation or taxis.
The New York law imposes a year-long freeze on new licenses in the largest market that Uber and Lyft service. Since 2015, the number of registered ride-sharing vehicles has increased from 12,600 to 80,000, according to city data.

The City Council’s move “will bring New Yorkers back to an era of struggling to get a ride, particularly for communities of color and in the outer boroughs,” Lyft said in a statement.
Following New York City’s lead, a similar proposal surfaced in the Chicago City Council, where aldermen in favor of limits cite increased traffic. According to city data, in the last three years the number of ride-share vehicles providing four or more trips per month quadrupled from about 15,000 to nearly 66,000.
While ride-sharing offers commuters convenience and a revenue source for drivers, two city aldermen argue that the benefits don’t outweigh the cost of what they called “ridiculous” traffic congestion.
Alderman Anthony Beale, 9th District, and Alderman Edward Burke, 14th, are considering a proposal that would cap ride-share vehicles and increase pay for drivers.
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s brother is an Uber investor, and argues that competition is better for the city. Emanuel pushed through a ride-share tax increase, which his office said has helped fund the Chicago Transit Authority’s efforts to upgrade its security cameras and rails.
“For decades the taxi industry had a monopoly in this city, but good luck getting a taxi to pick you up or drop you off on the South or West sides,” mayoral spokesman Matt McGrath told the Chicago Tribune. “That’s another kind of cap, an industry-imposed cap that existed forever.”


Christopher Lentino, director of outreach at Illinois Policy Institute, agrees.


“It’s a shame that Chicago is considering capping ride-sharing after years of trying countless other means to squash competition,” Lentino told Watchdog.org.
“Rather than creating a competitive atmosphere among the cab industry and ride-sharing industry, Chicago has decided to travel the path of greatest oppression by blaming an industry for the ills of the city. As we’ve seen with the cab industry, capping licensure only serves to artificially inflate prices, which, in turn, makes it harder for working individuals to make a living.”
Lentino said a better resolution would be to ease regulations for everyone in the industry.
“Instead of immediately jumping to more oppressive regulation, Chicago should take a step back and examine the current system and ease regulations on all,” he said. “A competitive marketplace is a boon for taxpayers.”
As local governments continue to grapple with regulating a growing industry, city councils in Seattle, Oklahoma City, Duluth City, and Roseburg, Oregon, introduced regulations, and in some cases, limited ride-sharing services. A lawsuit over ride sharing in Austin and San Antonio ended up being settled by the Texas Supreme Court.
Last year, Florida joined at least 30 other states by adopting a ride-share law. After four years of debate, the governor signed into law ride-sharing guidelines that went into effect July 1, 2017. The legislation grew out of a patchwork of regulations implemented by municipalities to oversee and tax transportation services. Differing rules created confusion and prohibited companies and users from using mobile apps and traveling from one area to another under conflicting rules.
The new law requires all personal ride-sharing services to perform a background check on all drivers, provide operation audits to the state every two years, and provide information on digital networks to local and state governments.



It also requires ride-sharing companies to carry $100,000 of insurance for bodily injury or death and $25,000 for property damage while a driver is logged onto their app without a passenger. Driving with a passenger requires $1 million in coverage.



More than one year after the law went into effect, local municipalities are raising concerns about the state’s ability to enforce it. Critics note that an undefined gray zone exists for the 40,000 Uber drivers in Florida. In some cases, they could not be in compliance with Florida law, but at the same time not act illegally.
According to Hillsborough County regulators, Uber drivers aren’t in compliance with the rules that govern for-hire vehicles. Uber continues to operate under its current insurance model while the state has yet to weigh in on its validity.
To date, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (FOIR) and the state department have not fully recognized Uber’s insurance policy as legal and in compliance until the Legislature amends the statute. Florida Highway Patrol Capt. Nancy Rasmussen, a spokeswoman for the state department, told the Tampa Bay Times that until the state Legislature determines whether Uber is operating as a taxi service or as a ride-share and is given its own definition under “transportation network companies,” the department is unable to answer questions about its coverage.
A similar issue arose in New York, when a court ruled that Uber drivers were not employees, but contract workers, which affected insurance and taxation regulations.
State Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, and other legislators have expressed an interest in addressing the issue by passing new regulations in next year’s session.
Brandes, who sponsored the bill that became law with Rep. Chris Sprowls, R-Clearwater, received overwhelming bipartisan support. Brandes maintains, “The future of transportation options includes a focus on shared mobility, and as we move closer to autonomous vehicles on our roadways, the future of ride-sharing is very bright.”

Shared mobility have experienced success in cities that have a really good transit background already…
All of these modes team up to enable people to live car-free or car-light lifestyles.
But now mid-sized cities, smaller communities and even rural areas are exploring theese solutions.
For the nearly 4.2 million rural households in the United States that don’t own a car, options for getting around can be limited: Public transit is almost nonexistent, and cab rides are too costly for day-to-day needs.
As for possible solutions, the CS Monitor mention the Finnish app called “Whim” that is still in beta links all bus, train, bike, taxi, and ride share programs so car-free users can buy a complete mobility package in one place to ensure smooth transitions for their trip.

Future Structure explores another possibility: “One strategy that has been used by the Denver Housing Authority and Boulder Housing Partners has been to build carsharing stations around public housing complexes.
By placing the vehicles in easy-to-access locations for lower-income residents, the programs should be viable option for trips to hospital appointments, grocery shopping or job interviews.

Australians in need of personal transport other than taxis have many options – Shofer, Taxify, GoCatch, Shebah and Uber. India’s Ola launched a few months ago, and Chinese DiDi started on Monday (Jun 25).
DiDi is no bit player. The company transports 450 million clients through 25 million rides a day. This is almost five times more than Uber.
DiDi is a company with the size, resources and know-how to challenge Uber’s dominance in ride-sharing and also to generate better, more efficient and equitable outcomes in urban transport more generally.
While competition between platforms is appealing for customers in the short term, it also raises questions about the long-term sustainability of the industry.
Taxis were profitable in the past because governments allowed supply to be limited. But in this new era of competition profitability is threatened and working conditions downgraded.
Currently none of these platforms are turning a profit.
THREATS AND COMPETITION
DiDi expects to turn its first profit in 2018 after losing US$300 million in 2017. But new entrants into the Chinese market are threatening that forecast.

Similarly, Ola plans to be profitable by 2019.
But Uber’s aggressive strategy in India means this is far from guaranteed.
In the meantime, Uber made a A$4.4 million profit in Australia in 2017 while its parent company made a record loss of US$6 billion in 2017.
There are two possible explanations for why Uber Australia turned a profit last year.
First, Australian governments changed regulations and effectively ended the domination of taxi cartels. Second, there wasn’t as much competition in 2017.
All of this will change with the entry of DiDi and Ola. We are likely to see, as has happened in other markets, a contraction of margins for ride-sharing operators.
Australia is just one battleground in the global war for market share being fought by Uber, DiDi and other competitors. While Uber may be considered the leader, it is a contested position. It has been kicked out of some European countries, is in fierce competition with Ola in India, and was bought out in China by none other than DiDi.
Complicating the picture even more is that DiDi, Uber and Ola have a shared institutional investor. DiDi further has a direct stake in Ola, Lyft and Grab.
Where Uber has pursued an aggressive international strategy with little regard for local rules, DiDi has adopted a more cautious, strategic and conciliatory approach. This includes acquiring local ride-sharing services, enticing taxi operators to join the platform and establishing relationships with local tech firms and regulators.
FLEXIBILITY AN IRONY
The ease with which Uber disrupted the Australian taxi market also threatens its profitability. The emergence of several competitors is possible because of the low costs of entry once an app and IT infrastructure are developed.
The consequence of increased competition is that drivers – who are classified as independent contractors – are continually squeezed. The only thing that stopped this dynamic in the taxi industry was state regulation and the emergence of local cartels.
Given the face-to-face nature of the service, there is an irony that the hyper-flexibility may end up hurting the very thing that was the platform’s main attraction – a better customer experience.
Cutting drivers’ pay may be a knee-jerk and flawed short-term response, potentially causing irreparable brand damage and harming consumer experience as drivers lack the resources or desire to look after their customers.
MORE THAN JUST RIDE-SHARING
The platforms’ classifications of their own services suggest that “big data” and more integrated transport solutions may be their real objectives.
DiDi regards itself as “a data company that relies on AI capabilities to advance new mobility solutions and breakthroughs in transportation technology”.
Similarly, Uber described itself as technology firm providing a “smartphone and technological platform” in court proceedings.
Indeed, Uber and DiDi both see integrated and autonomous transport solutions as the path to profitability. In addition to organising and controlling large amounts of valuable data, Uber’s plan is to integrate and streamline all forms of urban transport.

This might involve developing partnerships with governments, already a reality in North America.
Coupled with investment in driverless vehicles, this hints at a very different, and potentially sustainable, future.
DiDi has similar objectives and is already offering integrated transport services in its domestic market, where its app offers a range of services including taxis, buses and bike sharing. DiDi is Uber’s most serious competitor for global supremacy in ride-sharing services in terms of financial backing, war chest, scale of operations and digital capabilities.
While currently the dominant player in the Australian market, over time Uber might become the underdog in these ride share and transport wars.

GOVERNMENTS SHOULD INTERVENE
At the moment, the disruption caused by the platforms has come at a cost.
While increased competition has resulted in lower fares for consumers, it has also placed downward pressure on working conditions. Poor pay and working conditions are not new to this sector, or the wider gig economy. Unless the government steps in, exploitative practices will become ingrained very quickly.
The good news is that if ride-sharing is only a piece in the bigger puzzle of urban transport, state regulation should not be a deterrent to sophisticated players like DiDi and Uber. Additional regulation can ensure better outcomes for ride-share drivers, while they are still required.
In addition, it can also translate into better service for customers in the long term. The platforms’ technologies can help to solve urban transport problems.
So the good news is, if governments step in, this might be a war that customers, workers and the community can still win. However, which platforms will prevail remains to be seen.

If you hope to disrupt a market, it would be better to cooperate with the authorities to ensure that your service is here to stay. This is a lesson that Ng Yong Ching, who was previously city leader for Grab in Melaka and is now launching Singapore-based bike-sharing platform oBike in Malaysia, has learnt.
“The one thing the two services have in common is that we are doing something new. So, there is no framework or law governing the service. In the beginning, Grab did not have any legislation to govern it either. Now it does, which I see as progress. I am hoping to see the same sort of progress for oBike,” he says.
The relationship between disruptors and regulators can be tricky. Just look at the legal issues global ride-hailing giant Uber faced in multiple countries. While regulators may be eager to encourage new modes of transport, they have to ensure that the necessary rules and framework are implemented to protect consumers.
oBike has had its fair share of issues. Last September, more than 200 of its bikes in Petaling Jaya were seized for causing obstruction on sidewalks and for operating without a licence. According to reports, the company was fined RM17,000 by the Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ). Some of the bikes that were not parked properly were also seized in Subang Jaya.
Ng says the issue with MBPJ was miscommunication, which has been sorted out quickly with the help of the Selangor government. “We are trying to work with the authorities to provide alternative transport to fill the last mile between public transport stops and final destinations.
No matter what the service, if you want it to go well and benefit more people, you need to work closely with the authorities to come up with suitable plan.
“Bike sharing is currently new in Malaysia. The authorities do not have a regulatory framework to refer to, so sorting out the issues may take time. We are trying to help by sharing the information we have about how we operate in different countries.”
oBike is now in 15 countries. It offers a stationless bike-sharing system that users can access through a mobile app. The bike’s location can be tracked using the app and once the user is done with the ride, he can park and lock the bike in designated parking spots that do not obstruct traffic or walkways. Ng says the app has more than 500,000 users in Malaysia, who have made over one million trips in the first eight months of its operations.

When oBike first arrived in the country, the company had to educate the authorities and the public on how the system worked, even though bike-sharing is fairly common in other countries.
There were concerns about the lack of cycling lanes and the cluttering of bicycles on pavements became an eyesore.
“Of course everyone knows that cycling is not that popular in this country, so the biggest challenge was getting Malaysians to understand the bike-sharing concept and how it could benefit them,” says Ng.
oBike is tackling one problem at a time, breaking down the barriers to entry in this market. For instance, the company is working with the authorities to address the lack of cycling lanes by helping to identify the demand for them.
“We can track the data and share the routes. When we share the results with the authorities, they are happy. We understand that they have limited resources and it is impossible for them to make bike lanes everywhere. With our data, we show them which areas should have priority,” says Ng, adding that oBike shares its data on the most popular biking routes on a monthly basis or on-demand.
“We will inform them of the issues on the ground and provide feedback. We are glad that Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) just announced that the first city bicycle lane will be completed in January 2018. So, very soon, people can use it and more will come in,” he says.
“Of course, good infrastructure will give more people the confidence to take up biking. But this is a phase we need to go through. The infrastructure has to be implemented and one day, it will be. In the meantime, all the people who are already using what is available will give the authorities confidence that they are doing the right thing [by putting in bike lanes].”
How Malaysians should and shouldn’t bike
Last April, oBike launched its service in Selangor. By October, it had expanded to Kuala Terengganu, Muar and Kluang. Ng says the company goes into new cities often on the invitation of city councils after surveying the needs of the town. Approval for operations is on a city-by-city basis.
“In Kuala Terengganu, for example, it makes sense to cycle around because the city is not too big, the traffic is not too heavy and there are quite a number of tourists. I can say we are surprised by the growth, especially among youngsters and college students because there are a few colleges there. Tourists who go for day tours also like to use the bikes,” says Ng.
In Kluang, on the other hand, the oBikes are mostly used in the park. “It is more recreational for now. In Muar, it started in the parks as well. The town is not too big and there are parking issues, so it makes sense for people to cycle. There, it is not really the tourists or students using the bikes, but the locals. There is also a high demand [for the bikes] on weekends for recreational purposes,” he says.
In terms of growth, the company saw the biggest leap in Kuala Terengganu. But KL still has the highest number of users. Most of them are tourists and working adults.
“They use the bikes a lot during lunchtime. When you are in the city centre, it is hard to find a parking spot and you do not want to move your car when you go for lunch, in case you cannot find another parking spot when you get back. Cycling makes it easier to have lunch nearby,” says Ng.
Users usually cycle between 1km and 3km for less than 15 minutes, according to Ng. Most of the trips are also on less busy roads, he points out.
“We do send out a lot of educational messages to the users, telling them what they should take note of when they are cycling. For instance, we tell them not to cycle on highways and to make sure they keep to the left side of the road. Although there are no bicycle lanes on a lot of the roads, when there is less traffic, it is okay to cycle there,” says Ng.
Another issue bike-sharing platforms such as oBike face is their bikes being vandalised. Pictures of bikes mounted on road signs or dumped by the side of the road have gone viral on social media, igniting a debate on whether people are civil enough to appreciate such a service. But such vandalism is not unique to Malaysia, Ng is quick to point out, and the losses are currently manageable.
“We believe most of the vandalism or damage done to the bikes is not by our users because they appreciate the service. The point of oBike is that it is not your personal bike and you have access to 10,000 of them,” he adds.
A feature oBike is working on that will deter vandalism or bad parking is a geofence technology that can detect where or how the bike is parked. For instance, if a bike is parked on the pavement instead of a designated area, the user will be penalised.
“The user will lose credit points, which will increase their fares. The opposite applies. If you do things the right way, we will reward you,” says Ng.

Other challenges oBike faces include cybersecurity risks. Last December, it was reported that a global data breach occurred on its app, affecting users in five markets, including Singapore. Some usernames, email addresses and mobile numbers were stolen by the hackers.
Ng says the company is aware of this issue and has fixed the problem. “We have worked quickly to resolve this issue. As a tech company, user data and security are of paramount importance to us. We are now focusing our efforts on assessing the impact with the relevant stakeholders and assuring all our users that our systems have been fully restored and are secure.”
Ensuring customer satisfaction will be increasingly important to oBike as more competitors enter the Malaysian market. China-based Ofo, also a stationless bike-sharing system, expanded to Melaka last August. Mobike, another China-based company with a similar business model, launched its services in Shah Alam and Setia Alam last September.
Ng is confident oBike can defend its market by offering more value-added services and lowering prices. Currently, it charges 50 sen for every 30 minutes. “We are talking to our partners to provide some rewards. Just imagine when you go anywhere you have a special rate from the partner because they provide a spot and they are welcoming the user.
All this can be done and hopefully by the next quarter, we will be rolling this out,” he says.
“We are the first to launch the service and we remain the largest. So, I think we did the groundwork and created a wider path for our competitors. Everyone knows about bike-sharing now, especially the authorities. In the end, it will benefit the whole community.”

Arlington, Texas, is a large suburb about 20 miles west of Dallas. Its last census count was almost 400,000. It plays host to the Texas Rangers’ baseball stadium, the Dallas Cowboys’ football stadium and the original Six Flags theme park.
And now, it can add another notch to its belt: Arlington just became the first city in the United States to replace its entire municipal bus system with a fleet of vans from ridesharing provider Via.
The partnership is the latest evidence of a recent push toward app-based ridesharing services in favor of traditional public transit. Summit, N.J., and Altamonte Springs, Fla., have joined forces with Uber to provide subsidized rides to commuters, saving the cities hundreds of thousands of dollars while keeping costs down for customers.






In Arlington, Via vans pick up passengers on demand for a $3 fare. The company’s technology connects multiple passengers who are headed the same way, allowing riders to request a ride in real time and share a conveniently routed vehicle.
And it’s not just the good old U.S. of A that’s getting in on the rideshare game. Via has also been tapped to develop an on-demand public bus service in Singapore, a venture that Via CEO and co-founder Daniel Ramot is “thrilled” to begin.
“We are very excited to partner with the Land Transit Authority to bring an innovative on-demand public bus service to Singapore powered by Via’s tried and tested shared ride technology,” said Ramot, a native of Israel and a graduate of Hebrew University, Tel Aviv University and Stanford University who has a Ph.D in neuroscience.
“Singapore is at the forefront of mobility innovation in the region, and we are thrilled to see Via’s technology in Southeast Asia for the first time.”

In addition to Singapore and Arlington, Via has launched on-demand transit services in Queenstown, New Zealand, and Newcastle, Australia, with operations in Berlin, Germany; and Los Angeles and West Sacramento, Calif., coming later in 2018.

US-based ride-hailing service Uber Technologies Inc yesterday announced partnerships with three small-scale Taipei taxi operators to set up its UberTaxi service, in its latest efforts to secure a licensed operation.
Uber Taiwan, a local arm of Uber Technologies, is transforming itself into a taxi-hailing platform from a vehicle-sharing service by collaborating with licensed cab drivers, as it faces mounting pressure from local regulators to exit Taiwan.
Since making a comeback in mid-April, Uber Taiwan has teamed up with more than 100 local car rental companies, which provide licensed drivers and cars.
“We do this in complete cooperation and working with local governments,” said Brooks Entwistle, the firm’s new chief business officer for the Asia-Pacific region, at a news conference in Taipei.
“This is what we want to do and what we are doing going forward.”
Uber has launched its UberTaxi service in Myanmar, Malaysia and Sydney, Entwistle said.
Entwistle said the company could help boost earnings for local taxi drivers through its app.

There are 30,000 registered taxi drivers in Taipei, who operate at a 30 percent utilization rate, meaning they spend most of the time driving around the city looking for passengers, Entwistle said, citing an unspecified survey.
“The 30 percent of utilization is a number we can do a lot on [the] Uber platform to increase dramatically,” Entwistle said.
Starting today, the company’s ride-hailing app allows users to arrange and schedule transportation and logistics services with third parties.
The San Fransisco-based company said it is providing its app to Crown Taxi (皇冠大車隊), Asia Pacific Satellite Taxi Co (亞太衛星車隊) and QTaxi, a new entrant to the market.
While the business model remains the same, a major change is that passengers using the new service are to pay according to the taxi meter, rather than by credit card or other digital payment systems at a price calculated by Uber.
During the initial stage of about three months, Uber is to offer the taxi operators free use of its platform, the company said, adding that it did not rule out offering similar services in other cities.
“We do not see Uber as a competitor — we are cooperating with each other,” Asia Pacific Satellite Taxi president Chen Shin-chun (陳新鈞) told reporters.
“The cooperation means a lot for a small-scale fleet like us, as we could save the NT$3 million to NT$4 million [US$99,321 to US$132,428] it would cost build our own app.”
“Taiwan’s taxi-hailing industry is too traditional. We need to make a change to survive,” Chen said.
Taxi drivers are only making half the income they used to earn 30 years ago, as the high-speed railway and the Mass Rapid Transit system have taken a toll on the business, Chen said, adding that about one-third of Asia Pacific Satellite’s drivers have joined the program.

Car sharing is catching on in the country, especially among millennials, many of whom cannot afford to own a car because of the rising cost of living or who are too environmentally conscious to do so.
Car sharing is a relatively recent phenomenon in Malaysia. It is the next version of the car rental service, one that can be accessed through an app on a smartphone. The cars — be they new or peer-to-peer — can be hired for a few hours, a day or several days.
Enterprise spoke to four car-sharing app founders and CEOs to get a feel of the local market and some of the challenges they face in bringing this service to this market.
Moovby was the first such app to be introduced in the country. The peer-to-peer service came about when co-founder and chief technology officer Nik Muhammad Amin let a junior at university use his car to attend a convocation and got paid for it. “It was a lightbulb moment for me,” he says.
Nik started doing research on the car-sharing industry, trying to figure out if it was time to bring it to our shores. He decided to attend a Malaysian Global Innovation & Creative Centre (MaGIC) road tour to look at the possibility of setting up a business and it was here that he met Nadzri Sazali, co-founder of the company. “We attended MaGIC’s programme in Sabah and we invited another friend, who was good at product design, to help out,” he says.
After four months of being incubated by MaGIC, the trio received a RM150,000 grant from the Cradle Investment Programme (under CIP50), which enabled them to develop Moovby. The Cradle Investment Programme provides financial assistance to entrepreneurs to help them start technology-based ventures.

Kwikcar co-founder and CEO Jared Chan, on the other hand, was inspired to start his peer-to-peer car-sharing service on one of his visits back to Malaysia. He was living in Australia and when he came back for the holidays, he found readily available and appropriately priced rental cars difficult to come by.
So, he started Kwikcar for others like him who thought rental cars in the country were too overpriced. He believes he can achieve affordable rentals through this peer-to-peer car-sharing service. Having done his research, he knows that there are plenty of cars sitting idly in garages or parking lots that are ideal for such a service.
“Malaysia has the third highest ratio of cars per household in the world. Some 93% of all households in the country own a car and there are about 11 million passenger vehicles that are stationary for more than 20 hours a day,” Chan points out.
GoCar’s founding story is similar to that of Kwikcar. Founder TJ Tan was inspired to start the service when he came back for a vacation (also from Australia). He found the process of renting a car in
Malaysia unnecessarily tedious.
GoCar CEO Alan Cheah says its service offers a lot less hassle as those who want to rent a car can do so via its app. Tan started worked on the app in March 2015 and launched it in February the following year.
The new kid on the block, as far as car-sharing apps in the country go, is Socar. This app took off in South Korea and the company is hoping to replicate its success in Malaysia.
Most of these apps are only available in the Klang Valley, with the exception of  GoCar, whose services are also available in Langkawi. However, the concept is slowly catching on in the rest of the country. Drivers from Penang, Johor, Sabah and Sarawak are already trying to register themselves or their cars on these apps.
Socar is providing a test run of its “door-to-door” service (meaning that it delivers the car to your doorstep) in the Bangsar area for a flat fee of RM5. “You can choose where you want to pick up the car in Bangsar within certain hours and you drop off the car anywhere in Bangsar, also within certain hours,” says Socar Malaysia CEO Leon Foong.
Socar and GoCar provide brand-new car fleets for their car-sharing services. Socar charges RM8 per hour for its cheapest model, a Perodua Axia, while GoCar charges RM14.90 per hour for its cheapest model, the Nissan Almera.
GoCar’s fleet is supplied by the Mayflower car rental business. Cheah points out that GoCar’s fleet of cars belongs to the company as it finds the peer-to-peer model rather messy, with a lot of legal and insurance issues. “We are not heading into that until the issues are resolved. Right now, we have more than 180 cars. But we are adding cars every month. In fact, we are adding almost 50 cars a month,” he says.
“We have a huge variety of cars, from the Nissan Almera to seven-seaters for families and four-wheel drives. These are the most popular cars among the community. Our cars are either Nissans or Renaults.”
As for the peer-to-peer car-sharing services, prices vary depending on the car make. There is a large variety of cars provided, from regular sedans to sports cars with up to 700 horsepower. However, there are special rules for those who want to rent the more expensive cars, imposed by the service providers or the car owners themselves.
 
Helping millennials
Car sharing may be the best thing for millennials who want the freedom of driving without the burden of a car loan. But for those who choose to own their own car, such services could also help them with the loan.
“By renting out their cars every weekend, they can pretty much cover their car loans. That is really good because 25% of all millennial bankruptcy is due to unpaid car loans,” says Kwikcar’s Chan.
For instance, if someone lists his Perodua Myvi on Moovby, it will earn him about RM104 a day. If he rents it out four weekends a month, he could earn enough to pay for his loan, with a little left over as well.

But car sharing does not only earn those willing to participate extra pocket money. It is also good for the environment
A study conducted among 363 car-sharing respondents in the Netherlands, “Mobility and environmental impacts of car sharing in the Netherlands”, found 30% less car ownership among car sharers who also admitted that they drive 15% to 20% less than they did prior to car sharing.
According to the study, the shared cars mostly replace a second or third car. With reduced car ownership and car use, car sharers emit between 240 and 390 fewer kilogrammes of carbon dioxide per person, per year. This is between 13% and 18% of the carbon dioxide emissions related to car ownership and car use.
 
Insurance policies and safety
Moovby’s Nik admits that he had a hard time finding an insurance service provider that was on the ball or which kept up with the latest trends to insure cars and drivers. He went round to most of the insurance companies in Malaysia and was usually turned away with the usual reply: “I’m sorry, we do not provide such policies.”
He did not despair, however, and finally met the right insurance service provider. Allianz has been keeping up with most of the start-up trends and was the first insurer willing to come to the table and talk business.
Michael Fong, head of digital partnerships and innovation at Allianz, says the insurance coverage it currently provides car-sharing services in Malaysia is for personal accident and roadside assistance. He adds that since the company was already looking at ride sharing, addressing the needs of car-sharing providers was a natural progression.

“Because this is not vehicle attaching (which means the insurance is not attached to a specific vehicle but to the person driving the vehicle), it does not contravene any regulatory restrictions.
So, it is allowable to provide personal accident coverage for the driver as well as roadside assistance. I think this is really to take away some of the risks and challenges these platforms share,” says Fong
In Australia, for example, you can buy additional cover for your private car for ride and car sharing. “This allows you to do Uber and Grab and also put your vehicles on car-sharing platforms such as Kwikcar or Moovby,” says Fong.
He adds that Allianz goes the extra mile to ensure that the solutions provided are compliant with the provisions of regulators such as Bank Negara Malaysia and the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD).
“So, both regionally and locally, we are supportive of new economy start-up platforms because we are passionate about local entrepreneurs and start-ups,” says Fong, adding that there is also an environmental dimension to this.
“In Europe, car and bike sharing has alleviated the number of vehicles on the road. People have really moved from ownership to users. They take public transport and use car sharing for the last mile.”
Other than insurance, car-sharing service providers have put their own safety measures in place. Socar and GoCar, for instance, have a keyless unlock button that connects you to the app and permits an individual to unlock a car and start it.
Foong says when it comes to the safety of the car, many features can be installed to prevent theft or vandalism. But this mostly depends on a community’s mentality. “We leverage our members’ understanding of the principles behind car sharing, which means taking care of the car, not just preventing car theft but keeping it in good condition.”
Moovby has developed its own smart Internet of Things kit. “This kit is actually an advanced telematics kit installed in all Moovby cars. It can automate the locking system, start and stop the engine and provide real-time GPS as well as behaviour-tracking,” says Nik.
As for Kwikcar, a similar telematics device is installed in the cars. The idea is that the device will not just allow the company to track the car but also furnish it with data on consumer behaviour (how the car is used and where they are travelling, in terms of distance and location).
Chan says this provides Kwikcar with important data on peak demand times for the cars. “It gives us aggregated and not individual data.”
With four car-sharing services already in Malaysia, one may be forgiven for thinking that the market is getting a little crowded. But GoCar’s Cheah does not think so. “If you are looking at the long game, there is plenty of room for improvement, provided that the players focus on improving our transport ecosystem, rather than just coming in for commercial purposes,” he says.
Chan does not believe that car sharing will become obsolete with the introduction of new technologies such as self-driving cars, but he does think the business model may need to be tweaked over the next 5 to 10 years to keep up with the changes.
After all, car sharing is on trend. Nik says according to research by Navigant Research, worldwide membership in car-sharing programmes will grow from 2.3 million in 2013 to more than 12 million by 2020 as this model of shared personal transport is seen as a potential solution to global gridlock.
Self-driving cars
Though autonomous cars have yet to make a big impact on the world market, everyone agrees that it is just a matter of time. Where will that leave the car-sharing business?
Socar’s Foong, for one, is excited about autonomous cars. “We look forward to partner leaders in that space to offer car-sharing members even greater benefits. We are amazed by the possibilities and believe that car-sharing platforms will be a natural partner with our data and understanding of travel and traffic patterns.”
Cheah agrees, saying that autonomous vehicles will remove the line between car and ride sharing. The legislation, however, will need to catch up. “We need to prepare for the upcoming changes in the transport landscape as the introduction of autonomous vehicles will require fundamental changes to infrastructure, policies and mindsets.”

One of the nation’s first fully-planned communities, Coral Gables, Florida is making news by making good on its founders’ mission. When George Merrick created the south Florida city in 1925, he envisioned a city that would offer every amenity to its residents, while at the same time would become a center for international business. In every respect, Merrick’s dream has come true.
A Smart City Hub was launched on the City’s website in May, allowing Coral Gables to share the success of its artificial intelligence and open data with students, engineers, developers and others who see a benefit in collaborating.
Considering its historical appreciation of architecture, culture and connectivity among its people, it’s hardly surprising the city would find new ways to connect people with information.
The Hub is a public platform for exploring and downloading open data; for discovering and building apps; and for engaging to solve important local issues. Collaborators and the public can access convenient city services, analyze and combine Open Datasets using maps and graphs, as well as develop new web and mobile applications. History meet hi-tech.
Home to the University of Miami and 51,000 residents, Coral Gables is  continuing a strong track record of supporting both its residential and business sectors with more excellent City services.
This Smart Hub is just the latest of many hi-tech initiatives implemented in recent years. Its role is clear: delivering value, transparency, mobility, business intelligence and tools for citizen engagement. Amidst a thriving downtown district, residents and businesses now have a single entry point to access a vast treasure trove of public technology.
“A Collaboration and Open Data Platform for a Beautiful and Smart City,” the Smart City Hub delivers value, transparency, enhanced mobility, business intelligence, and various tools for citizenship engagement. Users can explore this public platform and download open data in order to develop new web and mobile applications.
Citizens and business owners have a single entry point to access public technology, such as: an App Store transparency portals with financial data and dashboards; eGov customer service to pay/register online for services; tools for record search; real-time pedestrian sensors; interactive maps; citizen engagement tools; and many other resources.

Features of the Coral Gables’ City Hub include:

Transparency Portals – allowing visitors to view financial and public information in dashoards and graphs. Examples include Capital Improvement Financials, City Financial Expenditures, City Election History and Demographics, and Permit Inspections Scheduled, among others.
Citizen Engagement – With the mission of connecting people with each other, this section allows residents access to “GovQA Customer Connect,” Public Police Records, Sustainable Living information, and provides a Virtual Tour of Coral Gables.
The App Store makes it easy for residents to download apps relating to traffic, parking, the trolley, and pay by phone options.
eGov City Services – allows users to pay for everything from a Building License to Certificate of Use, Invoices, Stormwater Bills, Lease, City Vendor Registration and Special Assessment to Parking Permits, Park Membership at the touch of a button. A connection to the City Employee Portal and a Careers Section are also updated regularly.
Open Data – connecting people with information, focuses on Coral Gables’ Agriculture, Boundaries, Business, Community Safety, Education, Health, Housing and Transportation. Web Apps powered by Open Data also include public access to Debris reporting and removal, sustainable living initiatives, information on historic districts and properties, and summary statistics and demographics.
Geographic Information Science or “The Science of Where” serves as a search engine for the Internet of Things, where viewers fine and use Open IoT data from around the world. For those who live, work and do business in Coral Gables, this offers access to data relating to Bike Routes, Public Works (street lights, traffic), the city’s popular Trolley, and even a Museum Exploration Map.

Connecting Data to a more informed community
City representatives are proud of Coral Gables’ ability to mesh old world values with new age technology. The city website details how “Coral Gables’ unique past is evident today, in the preservation of architecture and landmarks, but also in the spirit of its residents and the philosophy that guides its government.”
In designing the city in 1925, Merrick drew from the Garden City and City Beautiful movements of the 19th and early 20th Century. The city is renowned for successfully incorporating secluded residential enclaves and commercial areas inspired by the architectural style of the Mediterranean.
As city leaders see it, the same principles that made Coral Gables a success at its inception guide its current policies. Emphasis on protecting the residential sectors, preserving the natural environment and maintaining an international flavor are long-standing traditions.
With its newly-launched Smart City Hub, one of the first fully-planned communities in the nation is paving the way for others once again.

SO YOU just got laid off and you need to keep things going, and you need a steady source of income that could keep you afloat in the longer run.
One of the simplest solutions is to join one of the many ride-sharing outfits as a driver. Chances are, if you work hard enough, you might be making more than what you previously earned.
Even if you do not have your own car, you can opt to “rent and drive” any of the models offered by the ride-sharing company of your choice.
All you need is a driving licence and you’re good to go.
You might not think that this was possible a few years ago. When the ride-sharing concept was first introduced in Malaysia, many also thought that it was just a fad that might go as fast as it came.

The government’s decision to legalise the revolutionary system a couple of years ago was certainly a real game changer.
Even before the business became legit, ride-sharing companies were already expanding their operations with packages and promotions to woo more customers.
When the amendments to the Land Public Transport Act 2010 and Commercial Vehicles Licensing Board Act 1987 were officially passed in August last year, leading ridesharing companies became even more aggressive, with more new players entering the market.
With e-hailing laws scheduled to be gazetted this year, industry players are projected to find equal amounts of success (and failures) in the soon-to-be regulated operating environment.
Grab
Since its humble beginning as a taxi-based e-hailing app in Malaysia back in 2012, Grab has grown to be the market leader not only in the country, but in South-East Asia as well.
The course taken by the ride-sharing company has been one of expansion, operating in 168 cities across eight Asean countries, boasting over 2.3 million drivers and commanding 95% of third-party taxi-hailing apps today.
Based out of Singapore, the company is now entering the e-money game via its e-wallet service, Grab-
Pay, having already received central bank approval to launch the online payment platform in Malaysia and begun commercial operations in Singapore.
The e-wallet presently facilitates over 3.5 million transactions daily and a billion transactions annually.
With a strong financial backing which saw the company securing approximately US$4.63 billion (RM18.52 billion) in investments since May 2014, Grab has been striving on the principles of a sharing economy to become a leading tech player in the region.
With reports that the leading e-hailing provider for the region is looking to buy a stake in Uber’s South-East Asian business, Grab appears to be sealing its dominance in the market by taking over its biggest competitor.
Uber
Kick-starter ride-sharing company Uber Technologies Inc has a strong foothold in Malaysia’s e-hailing market with operations spanning 15 cities across the country.


Uber has a strong foothold in Malaysia’s e-hailing market with operations spanning 15 cities across the country

It might be dwarfed by Grab’s 28 cities of operation, but the San Francisco- headquartered e-hailing player still provides a competitive ridesharing alternative in Malaysia as users often alternate between the two companies based on price-point and availability.
Uber was further responsible for making the concept of securing a ride with the touch of a button, an idea born in the snowy Parisian streets back in 2008, into an everyday reality for the world.
The company has weathered its own storms since its inception in 2009. Recently, its internal issues at the key management level grabbed media’s attention while dealing with increasingly stringent regulations internationally.
Despite Malaysia giving the green light to e-hailing, the fate of Uber in the country is unclear ahead of reports that the company is looking to divest out of its South-East Asian operations.
Details are sketchy at the moment with, neither Grab nor Uber, willing to comment on the speculation.
The deal presents an opportunity for the latter to unlock some cash as it seeks to recover to profitability.
Riding Pink
The first of its kind in Malaysia, Riding Pink is a ride-sharing platform for and by women, aimed at providing female drivers an alternative source of income and a reliable, same-gender passengers, safe public transport.
Founder Denise Tan conceived the idea when she realised how difficult it was to re-join the workforce after becoming a stay-at-home mother to support her family.
Having observed that there were no ride-sharing services exclusive to women in the country, especially in light of growing safety concerns, Tan and her husband began commercial operations for the service in October 2016, charging a RM1 base rate and RM1 for pre-booking.
The platform measured over 100 drivers early this year and is still very much in its infancy with no mobile-based app to its name. Bookings can be made on the company’s Facebook page, or via WhatsApp.
Operating as a women-exclusive ride-sharing service, Riding Pink could carve a niche within the rapidly growing e-hailing industry by catering to a presently underserved  market.
PICKnGO
The rapid rise of e-hailing services in Malaysia left the fate of taxi drivers in the balance as they struggled to break even amid the competitive environment.
Pick N Go Sdn Bhd — the taxibased e-hailing app servicing the Greater Kuala Lumpur area — aims to provide a lifeline to the increasingly disenfranchised taxi community by providing a cost-competitive alternative to mainstay e-hailing providers Grab and Uber.
The mobile-app utilises metered rates over surge pricing, the latter of which can result in Grab and Uber rates to be as much as three times higher than average.
Bringing in only registered and licensed taxi drivers, the company is looking to secure 10,000 drivers on the platform within a year from its official launch on Aug 7 last year.
Having secured approximately 5,000 mobile-app downloads to date, PICKnGO is a joint venture between five taxi companies that is striving to provide convenient, consistent and competitive taxi services in an industry measuring some 180,000 drivers nationwide.

Dacsee
In an increasingly saturated operating environment, finding a niche becomes not only a novel, but needed approach in gaining a foothold in the market.
Decentralised Alternative Cabs Serving and Empowering Everyone (Dacsee) is doing just that by using blockchain technology to provide ride-sharing users transparency, and drivers greater control over their earnings.
Akin to the multi-tier marketing model, drivers on the Dacsee platform are allowed to form their own fleets to derive and earn their own commission, while the company itself will only charge 1% to 2% from the drivers’ earning.
This is significantly lower than the 20% to 25% commission rates collected from Grab and Uber. All transactions on the decentralised platform will use Ethereum ERC20 tokens to ensure transparency for both drivers and users.
Dacsee is aiming to secure a customer network of 50,000 people when it launches operations in April this year, paving the way for innovative solutions in a tech-driven industry.
MULA Car
E-hailing services have played a pivotal role in ensuring last-mile connectivity for commuters as journeys to and from work begin and end in a car.
Mula Car International Sdn Bhd is providing this connectivity in style by offering users their pick of premium and luxury multi-purpose vehicles and compact cars for their journeys.
The mobile-based e-hailing app has a fleet of 250 cars providing transportation and logistics services in its home base of Penang, while having grown its business by 20% every month since launching in May last year.
The growth has encouraged the company to expand its fleet to 750 cars with an expansion plan that would cover Johor, Melaka, Seremban (Negri Sembilan) and Ipoh (Perak) before the end of the year.
By 2019, the company is anticipated to offer as high as 2,000 MULA cars operating in Malaysia.
Going to and from work in luxury could soon be a reality for Malaysian commuters.

DETROIT — General Motors said Thursday it will bring self-driving technology in the form of ride sharing to consumers by next year. It said the vehicles would be introduced in the United States, but did not say in which cities it planned to roll out the service.
To hasten that goal, the automaker has partnered with technology investor SoftBank Vision Fund to invest in GM Cruise technology, the automaker said Thursday.
SoftBank, a large technology investment company with stakes in such companies as Uber, will invest $2.25 billion in GM Cruise Holdings, and GM will invest $1.1 billion in GM Cruise, its self-driving arm, when the transaction closes at the end of June, the company said.
“This would be one of the largest scaled or the largest scaled effort in the space,” Michael Ronen, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, told the media. “There is a lot of interest in the space. This is as big as it gets.”
While GM has not yet had discussions with government agencies on approval to put self-driving cars on the roads, Chairman and CEO Mary Barra said she’s confident they will be supportive because, “This technology is going to improve safety on our roadways.”

The company did not say whether it planned to launch its own ride service or partner with another company.
GM leaders said the automaker was prepared on its own to fund GM’s long-stated goal of launching commercial autonomous vehicles at scale beginning in 2019. But in discussions with SoftBank over the past few months, GM found the two shared the same vision to bring autonomous vehicle technology to market.
The partnership will speed GM’s goal and help attract more talent to the GM Cruise team. GM Cruise employed 40 people when GM acquired it two years ago, today it employees about 800, said GM President Dan Ammann.
GM has a $500 million investment in ride sharing company Lyft, which it made in 2016.
“Our Cruise and GM teams together have made tremendous progress over the last two years,” Barra said in a news release. “Teaming up with SoftBank adds an additional strong partner as we pursue our vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.”
The SoftBank Vision Fund investment will be made in two pieces. Vision Fund will invest the first slice of $900 million. When the Cruise autonomous vehicles are ready for commercial deployment, the Vision Fund will make the second investment of $1.35 billion, “subject to regulatory approval,” GM said.
SoftBank Vision Fund will own 19.6 percent equity in GM Cruise, GM will own the balance. This investment process will give GM flexibility with respect to capital allocation, GM said.
“The GM Cruise approach of a fully integrated hardware and software stake gives it a unique competitive advantage,” said Michael Ronen, managing partner of SoftBank Investment Advisors in a media statement. “We are very impressed by the advances made by the Cruise and GM teams, and are thrilled to help them lead a historic transformation of the automobile industry.”
The GM and SoftBank Vision Fund investments are expected to provide the necessary capital to reach commercialization of autonomous vehicles “at scale” beginning in 2019, GM said.
“We’ve been in discussion for quite some time. We’re very aligned as to what this technology can bring to the world,” Ammann said.
“The capital we’re raising and announcing today is very significant and will carry us to full deployment.”
Ronen of SoftBank concurred.
“This feels like the right time. There’s still work to do between now and next year to make this work,” Ronen said.
“We have invested significant amounts of capital in ride sharing globally. We’ve made other investments in technology that relates to automotive including artificial intelligence. Frankly, we’re also at the beginning of that investment strategy as it relates to automotive and there’ll be plenty of opportunities,” to do more, Ronen said.
There is exclusivity between GM and SoftBank. The two have agreed to a seven-year term before either can change their arrangement. Both companies said that time frame will provide enough time to significantly grow technology.

A forum hosted by Smart City Consortium on June 1 explored how technology shapes lives. Smart mobility is a way to move people and goods using new technology that is faster, cleaner, more accessible than traditional options, striving towards automated and personalized travel on-demand as well as providing an efficient, safe and comfortable transport system.
Information and communication technology infrastructure, combined with open data, are the keys to making mobility smarter.
HK on the move
It is important to Hong Kong, as citizens are heavy users of public transport.
“In Hong Kong, there are 12.6 million passenger trips on public transport every day, with the railway being the backbone,” says Charles So, executive director of Traffic and Transport Planning at AECOM. “In addition, there are 354 licensed vehicles for every kilometer of road.”
He says Hong Kong has been doing a lot in this regard. They city has an automatic toll collection system, a mobile application called HK eTransport that shows users different routes and real-time public transport mobile applications.
Next step
The next thing for Hong Kong to do, according to So, is to develop an all-in-one application that integrates different platforms for real-time data, as well as a free-flow tolling system that allows high-speed free-flow tolling for all road users driving through the toll gantry without the need of toll plaza and toll booths.

“The ultimate goal of smart mobility is [to move] towards automated systems, from the fully-integrated ones,“ says So. “By then, automated predictive technologies would be adopted.”
He even suggests, developing smart intersections: smart devices for pedestrian crossing that assist the elderly and the disabled.
Meanwhile, Kelvin Shum, senior director at Esri China (Hong Kong), lays out six indicators for developing smart mobility – safe and secure, well-run, livable, health, prosperous and sustainable.
“Real-time data are needed, so we can develop applications for users to acquire the information they need to reduce waiting time,” says Shum. “We also need to promote green mobility to reduce pollution and alleviate congestion. This can improve people’s health and save their time.”
Shum also suggests clean energy for vehicles for the sake of sustainability.
One game changer, according to Shum, is geographic information system (GIS). With GIS, we can understand travel patterns, help response to crisis and traffic incidents, improve overall safety and security and identify ways for cost saving during journey through integrating real-time data, analyzing it and sending notifications to the users.
In the end, Hong Kong would have the potential to be a pioneer in the region to make mobility easier and friendlier.
“Hong Kong can be a superconnector. It can make “smart city” a major industry to influence the region and set an example for neighbouring cities such as Shenzhen,” said David Chung, Under Secretary for the Innovation and Technology Bureau, who speaks on the government’s behalf.
“Technology drives change, shaping our city, our lives and our government. The government is improving its service to manage the city better and serve the citizens better,” says Chung.

A full electric city bus today costs around Rs. 1.5 crore. The first electric city bus by Ashok Leyland, expected to be launched by late next year, would be significantly cheaper, perhaps by over Rs 30 lakh. That would be not because of any heavy discount but thanks to a new alliance which takes out the battery (the most expensive and very heavy component of an EV) and its charging from the cost equation.
Ashok Leyland has made a head-start in electric and hybrid buses, in both CNG and diesel, including those that do not require a plug-in. Sun Mobility aims to be a leading provider of universal energy infrastructure and services to accelerate mass EV usage.
Sun Mobility plans to revolutionise the transportation sector by deploying a unique open-architecture ecosystem built around its proprietory smart batteries and a network of quick interchange battery stations.
These stations, mainly powered by renewable energy, will refuel EVs at a cost lower than and faster than conventional petrol-diesel fuel stations. “Our focus is commercial viability (of EVs) today,” Chetan Maini, vice-chairman, Sun Mobility, told Autocar Professional. Of the various methods of ‘refuelling’ an EV – overnight charging, one-hour fast charging, ultra-fast charging in less than an hour and swapping, the swapping style helps remove the battery from the equation, lowers the cost and removes range anxiety the fastest. Maini is betting on this advantage for electric mobility in India to gain from, and of course, for Sun Mobility to succeed.
Commenting on the alliance, Vinod K Dasari, CEO and MD, Ashok Leyland, says, “Ashok Leyland has always leveraged Indian engineering and innovation to develop world-class solutions. We were the first and only manufacturer to develop BS III emission compliance using a mechanical fuel pump.
We were also the first in India to develop an SCR-based BS IV solution in 2010. In 2017, we were the world’s first and only company to develop an EGR-based BS IV solution, called iEGR. Our partnership with Sun Mobility is yet another step towards bringing world-class solutions to India, developed in India, and by Indians. We hope to bring several new innovative products to the market at the earliest.”
It was in 2010 that India first got the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan. With that as the base, the FAME India Scheme was launched in April 2015 to promote electric and hybrid vehicles in India. The roadmap for future mobility solutions, released in May by Central government think-tank NITI Ayog, has also focused heavily on electric mobility. Industry leaders say that unlike earlier occasions, the government is more focused and determined to make mass electric mobility a reality. For that to happen, all stakeholders will have to invest significantly. “This would need a level of partnership that the industry hasn’t seen before,” says Maini.
NEW SMART SOLUTION
Sun Mobility, a 50:50 joint venture between Virya Mobility 5.0 and Sun New Energy Systems, pioneers in areas of electric mobility and clean energy, says it will partner with multiple OEMs to integrate its proprietary smart battery solution into a range of innovative EVs – cars, buses, rickshaws and scooters.

The smart batteries will be modular, easily swappable, highly secure, IoT-enabled and can be easily refuelled on a pay-as-you go basis. This energy infrastructure integrated with EVs, smart batteries and clean energy will accelerate the transformation of mobility towards a sustainable, pollution-free future.
Commercial vehicles – city buses, cars owned by cab aggregators and three-wheelers – will be largely targeted to promote electric mobility in the country. Two-wheelers, the biggest segment in the EV industry currently, is also poised to see growth in the coming years.
In an EV, the battery is the most expensive, and also the heaviest component. In the case of buses, Sun Mobility will fit swappable batteries, which are only 20-25 percent of the size of a conventional EV bus battery. “It’s a very flexible open solution where there’s no difference in the price of a bus, whether you are doing 150 or 250 kilometres a day,” says Maini. With smaller batteries, both the operating cost and the overall weight of the vehicle are reduced.
In terms of cost, an electric bus, with the battery and charging system out of the equation, is costlier than a conventional bus with a regular diesel powertrain, but Maini says it will be more cost effective than a conventional bus with a more powerful powertrain and automatic transmission.
A “few patents on the overall ecosystem” of Sun Mobility’s business model, which also includes the battery swapping and management and some core battery technology. Since India doesn’t have any cell manufacturer, the company imports the cells and builds the rest indigenously. In the future, as business grows, Sun Mobility “may probably be directly or strategically involved” in the business of cell manufacturing.
Sun Mobility is in “advanced discussions” with some OEMs and mobility services providers for alliances like the one it has struck with Ashok Leyland. Maini wants to provide different solutions for different players. “Across the chain there will be different types of partnership with companies,” he says.

A strong focus by the government on making mass electric mobility a reality, also presents a good opportunity for standardisation of some systems and processes to reduce overall costs. This is where Sun Mobility could benefit from.
And there possibly will be more players in this space. Sun Mobility will tap a Maini Group firm to develop charging technology to charge all the batteries that vehicles leave behind at the swapping centres. These stations, predominantly powered by renewable energy, will refuel EVs at a cost lower than and at speeds faster than conventional petrol/diesel stations.
A business proposition like Sun Mobility’s could aid in faster adoption of electric vehicles in India. However, there would be a challenge that its engineers will have to address, and that is to ensure the energy density of its batteries remain the same even after different charging cycles.
Shared mobility is attracting a strong focus of Maini and his team as the vehicles clock more kilometres and makes the business case stronger for the company. “Over time, if you think about the shared economy, the value chain is going to be – an OEM, an energy provider, a mobility solution provider.
Unless you get a cost-effective solution, none will have business,” says Maini, who started India’s first electric car company in 2001. He wants Sun Mobility to “play” the middle role with a vision of “Let’s make EVs viable”.

The impact of ride-hailing has been swift and sweeping. Uber, which was founded less than a decade ago in 2009, has become a multibillion dollar transportation startup with worldwide ambitions, and the technical ability to pursue autonomous vehicle technology and even experiment with Blade Runner-esque flying cars.
But as Uber and Lyft continue to expand, it’s important to remember that for all the high-tech advances, an equally important part of their legacies has been institutionalizing the gig economy. With more than two million employees in the United States combined, these two companies helped make these new working arrangements an everyday part of many people’s lives.
And their continued reckoning with labor issues, costs, and recruitment suggest they haven’t figured out the right formula.
Harry Campbell understands the evolution of Uber and Lyft better than most. Known as the Rideshare Guy, after his popular blog and podcast about working in the industry, Campbell created an important forum and resource for the industry, inspired by his time as a driver.
His new book, The Rideshare Guide, offers advice on getting started and getting established as a driver, but also offers insight into how ridehailing has evolved, and the issues that drivers face.
“People take Uber or Lyft as a passenger, and they often don’t understand how many people these companies are employing,” Campbell told Curbed. “Lyft has more than 700,000 drivers, and Uber has 2 to 3 million worldwide, with 1.5 million in the U.S. It’s becoming a more traditional option for work, whereas in the past, it was something sort of cool and different.”
Curbed spoke to Campbell about making it in the gig economy, the frustrations of drivers, and the future of Uber, Lyft, and their competitors.

Is Uber actually making moves to treat its drivers better, with the recent change in leadership, and are they making a difference?


“It’s clear they’re starting to care more about drivers. Last year, they launched the 180 Days of Change campaign and added tipping and a 24-hour support line. [These changes are] not huge, but they represent a move in the direction of improving things for drivers. But the complaints you heard from drivers were that these weren’t exactly revelations.

The 24-7 support line is something people have been asking about for the last three to four years. It was really odd there was no way to call Uber.”



“Uber is still facing an uphill battle because they’ve done so little for so long. They deserve some credit, but probably not as much as if they had been supporting the drivers all along. The new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi seems like he cares more about drivers.
But drivers care more about raising their rates, and the ever-growing commission Uber takes. It looks like the company is addressing everything else but those issues.”
Turnover is still incredible massive for these companies. Is that strictly a matter of pay?
“Pay is a big factor. A lot of drivers come in with the expectation that they’re going to make good money. Look at the marketing campaigns they’re running, when they talk about “the ultimate side hustle.”
When you measure messaging and expectations— remember that the average driver is making between $16 and $18 a hour before taxes, close to minimum wage—it hurts retention. Factor in services like UberPOOL [Uber’s shared ride service] and the ever-growing commission Uber and Lyft are taking, and that doesn’t help.”
Uber gets billions from venture capital investors and can’t pay their drivers a full-time wage, is bleeding money, and still telling people to come and work for them. How do drivers view these contradictions?
“Retention is poor, and a lot of drivers are quitting, but there are also lots of drivers who are able to figure it out in the bigger cities. In cities such as LA and San Francisco, for example, they’re able to make $7 more an hour than the average. Drivers with experience are making more than newbie drivers.
There’s a ton of variability, and subsidies and bonuses have become such a huge part of income for drivers now.”

So for Uber and Lyft, retention and expanding the workforce is clearly a big challenge. What can they do to make a difference?
“It’s really not the sexiest thing, but they just need to pay drivers more. Uber and Lyft are trying to do everything they can do around the edges right now. They’re investing in customer support and try to improve pickups and drop offs for UberPOOL.
But pay and flexibility are the main things that drivers care about, and everything else isn’t that important. Uber made a big announcement in April, and had the CEO speak. Drivers were expecting a lot. And it was all for a new driver’s app.
The feedback we got from drivers was that the app was cool, but that’s not even on the list of the top five issues I actually care about.”
Does the recent California case about independent contracting impact Uber and Lyft, and will this case and others cases like it make a big difference?
“There’s a lot of hype around that case, and it is a big ruling. If you look at the test they talk about in the case to determine the difference between an employee and independent contractor, Uber and Lyft drivers are clearly employees.
But their whole model is predicated on independent business contractors. Uber and Lyft will do anything to protect that, so if that means giving drivers a little more freedom so they meet the independent contractor test, they’ll do it.”

Drivers ask, ‘Why are you spending money on flying cars? Pay me now, I need to pay bills now.’”

Do you see the work you’re doing as a first step in setting the boundaries for gig economy jobs in the future, and future labor issues?
“The book is ultimately a how-to guide for driving for Uber and Lyft, but there’s a lot of advice that’ll be applicable to anybody working in the gig economy.
When you start, the companies are all shiny and new. But once you get into it and start peeling back the layers, at the end of the day, you’re running a business. There’s all sorts of tough business choices you have to make in terms of liability and taxes.”
Are these companies sustainable?
“I think the model is sustainable because on the consumer side, there is huge demand for Uber and Lyft. And on the driver side, despite the massive turnover, millions of people are driving for these companies.
If you can earn the same amount working 40 hours a week at Uber or McDonald’s, well, I’d rather work for Uber. With other jobs, you have no flexibility. So I think this mode is here to stay.”
“But for Uber and Lyft, there’s a lot of venture capital money subsidizing the pay side of things. The amount that riders pay and drivers get paid is still in flux. But I think they’re going to have to pay drivers more.
This is Silicon Valley 101: Lower prices to generate demand and subsidize until eventually you find that balance. Uber and Lyft have been really resistant to raising prices. That’s why I call this the Golden Era of Rideshare, it’s cheaper than ever to take an Uber and Lyft, especially with Lyft Line and all of these budget-friendly options for the average rider.
I was surprised when reading the book at just how much drivers hate services like UberPOOL. Is there anything they can do to turn that around?
“When Uber first launched UberPOOL, they charged less even though it was more challenging for drivers to make all the pickups and dropoffs, and they would get paid less. You can imagine it wasn’t well-received. Now, drivers use these rides to make their bonuses quicker. Going forward, drivers will need to be rewarded better for their effort.”
“One of the things I enjoy highlighting is that Uber’s narrative to the public and media varies with the story they’re telling their actual drivers. ‘UberPOOL is the future for us, it allows us to improve congestion and do more rides and improve utilization.’ But 65 percent of drivers are dissatisfied with their UberPOOL experience, and almost everybody hates it. UberPOOL may have benefits for the company, but it’s still a work in progress.
So is there a huge disconnect between the pay issues of everyday drivers, and news that Uber is sinking money into a flying car summit?
“Drivers aren’t dumb. There’s a disconnect between what it’s like being a driver, day in and day out, and the employees working at Uber and Lyft. It’s hard for them to put themselves in the drivers’ shoes. But the drivers are thinking short-term.
You look at the retention numbers, and they probably won’t be around when self-driving cars are here. They ask, ‘Why are you spending money on flying cars? Pay me now, I need to pay bills now.’”

The ride share economy is set for another shake-up with the launch of Taxify in Australia this morning.

Founded in Estonia and now operating across Europe, Taxify has entered the Australian market in Sydney only at this stage and claims to have 4000 drivers already registered.
Taxify will take 15 per cent commission from its drivers, which it claims is only around half that of Uber and is offering a 50 per cent discount to all rider for one months as part of its launch
Markus Villig, founder and CEO of the new platform said he had been looking forward to launching in Sydney.
“We are confident that locals are looking for an alternative ride sharing option, and Taxify is committed to providing both riders and drivers with what they want,” Mr Villig said. “We have based our business model on fairness and transparency and it is because of this that we have had so many drivers sign up to Taxify in such a short space of time.”
Taxify’s Australian country manager Samuel Raciti said he expected the launch to be well received by drivers and passengers, who would both benefit financially.

“We value and reward loyalty and are excited to offer e new experience to Sydneysiders,” he said. “Our focus as a company has always been providing our drivers with higher revenue-per-ride, as we’re firm in our belief that happy riders mean happy drivers.”
Taxify, like Uber, will have surge prices and multipliers for busier periods, but these would be capped to 1.5 times the regular price, a spokesperson confirmed. The cap will not apply on New Year’s Eve however, in order to ensure there are enough drivers on the road to meet demand.
Moneysaver HQ contacted Uber for a response to the launch, but an Uber spokesman said the platform does not comment on competitors.

PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — With a stated goal of making the outdoors more accessible to everyone, the Oregon State Parks Foundation is teaming up with 2 car-sharing services to have state park day-use parking passes in all their cars.

ReachNow and Zipcar will have the free parking passes and state park guides in all of their car-sharing services throughout the Portland metro. This is the second year Zipcar has taken part in this program, but greatly expanded from its 2017 effort.
Cars from both services can be reserved by the hour or the day.
From tidepools at the coast to disc golf at Champoeg State Park, there are many adventures within a 2-hour drive of Portland.
In 2017, there were more than 50 million day-use visits to the Oregon State Parks. But the foundation said transportation can be a barrier to this kind of outdoor recreation.


A ReachNow car on the streets in downtown Portland, May 21, 2018 (KOIN)

ReachNow said all the BMW 3-series and BMW X1 SAV vehicles in their Oregon and Seattle fleets will have the state park passes by Memorial Day weekend.
“When you’re ready to go, you can open up the app, you search for a BMW,” said Tim Navarrette of ReachNow. “All our BMW X1’s and 3-series have the state park passes in them.”
Navarrette said it’s an easy way for people to get to the state parks and help out, as well.
“For every trip that’s taken to an Oregon State Park, we’re donating money to the Oregon State Parks Foundation,” he said. “We’re doing it in the Seattle area and Portland, as well.”
The company will donate up to $25,000 to the Oregon or Washington State Parks Foundations this summer.
Some Zipcars have a bike rack, making it easy to take your bike with you on an adventure.
“I think it’s a great option for people who live downtown, don’t have cars and do a lot of public transportation,” said Heather Anderson, who works in Portland.

Austin’s ground transportation industry descended even further into madness this year, as companies across the field jockeyed for a position in a rapidly expanding and ever-changing market.
ATX Co-op Taxi and their fleet of bright-green cabs sprouted in the spring, taking another stab at the co-op model that has eluded Austin’s cabbies for decades.
It’s provoked skepticism from industry veterans like Austin Cab Company, who (while losing drivers to the cause) argued that the idea had been pursued multiple times before and hadn’t been financially viable.

The taxi drivers didn’t have much time to bicker in their own silo. Riders welcomed Uber and Lyft back with open arms in June after the Texas Legislature gutted municipal rideshare regulations.
With them came the aggressive pricing models and other incentives designed to win back a market that had been burned a year earlier when the two titans stole out of town after losing a ballot measure to nix city regs.
One upstart transportation network company, the Arizona-based Fare, dropped out of Austin within two weeks. Others that had developed in the rideshare giants’ absence felt an immediate pinch, but have tried to harness community support to keep truckin’ along.
Homegrown RideAustin focused on community partnerships, like a program with Community Care Col­lab­or­a­tive to help uninsured or low-income county residents get to the doctor.

In August, Boston-based Fasten hired former RideAustin employee (and former communications dir­ect­or for the TravCo Democratic Party) Joe Deshotel as its new director of community engagement, and immediately focused on events packaging quirky consumer data.
Not to be outdone, Austin’s carsharing stalwart Car2Go hit upon a quick success when it introduced a fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles. Driver interest was so high the company (which is owned by Mercedes) decided to ditch the Smart car fleet and go full Benz.
Continuing into next year, the city’s Transportation Depart­ment is working with City Council to discard archaic chauffeur regulations that don’t make as much sense in an environment dominated by ridesharing apps and digital meters.
But change doesn’t come easy, so expect a 2018 full of twists and swerves, beginning in February when deregulation talk concerning cabs is due to take center stage at Council.
They’re a particularly ornery bunch, those cabbies, and quite open to airing their grievances – whatever they may be – down at Council chambers. We’ll keep our eyes on the road.

Despite what seems like near-constant gridlock across the city, and Los Angeles’ reputation as an auto-focused metropolis, not everyone who lives here owns a car. That is particularly true in Downtown, where a growing number of individuals have given up their vehicles in favor of mass transit, or families have realized that they can get by with just one car.
So it’s not surprising that a number of alternatives to driving solo have taken hold in Downtown. In addition to the increasing number of people who walk between home and work, Uber and Lyft are commonplace. Bicycles lanes are appearing across the community and the L.A. Department of Transportation is working on an expansion of the DASH bus system.
 The concept of app-fueled car sharing is also taking hold. Getaround, which allows individuals to rent out their personal vehicles, began service in Downtown late last month. Other systems have been operating even longer.

On Friday, April 20, a new player joined the lineup. What sets BlueLA apart is that the city government itself has a stake, and the cars are all electric.
BlueLA is a collaboration between LADOT and Blue Solutions, a car sharing and mobility-focused subsidiary of the French transportation company the Bolloré Group. It seeks to serve a variety of customers, with a special focus on people in low-income communities who only need a car part-time.
The program offers a fleet of compact hatchback-style vehicles built by Bolloré. They are set up at charging hubs around the city, with stations already operating or in the works in Downtown, Koreatown and Echo Park. It is launching with 25 cars and 35 charging stations. All of the cars are four-seat rides with the BlueLA logo painted on the side.




There are currently three BlueLA hubs in Downtown, and each has spots for five charging stations. The vehicles can travel 160 miles on a charge.


Three of the initial seven hubs are in Downtown, with three more expected to open in the Central City in the coming months. The company expects to have 100 vehicles available at 40 locations by the end of the year, and to triple in size by 2021. The service operates 24 hours a day.
Blue Solutions Managing Director Christophe Arnaud said the initial stations were chosen as target areas where people either may not have a car, or where they might walk or bike to work and need a vehicle only for short trips.
“Each station’s location was chosen to support the low-income communities,” Arnaud said.
BlueLA comes in the wake of other cities that have launched their own car-sharing service. Indianapolis partnered with the Bolloré Group to start BlueIndy in 2015. Chicago’s Department of Transportation is exploring a pilot program for a similar service called Car2Go.
The LADOT developed the idea of an affordable, electric car-sharing service and began searching for partners in 2016, according to a department spokesperson.
The service operates on a membership system, with users paying $5 a month for access and 20 cents a minute for a ride (it works out to $12 an hour). People are billed on a credit card tied to their account.
For households of four with an annual income below $45,000, membership is $1 a month, and rides are 15 cents a minute, or $9 an hour. To qualify for the lower rate, users must provide a pay stub or other income statement.
“Our aim was to bring sustainable, accessible solutions to Los Angeles,” said LADOT spokesman Oliver Hou. “This gives everyone freedom of movement while respecting the environment.”
The initial hubs in Downtown Los Angeles are at Sixth and Bixel streets, Glendale and Beverly boulevards, and 11th and Santee streets. There are five charging stations at each location.
Additional hubs are planned for Los Angeles Trade Technical College, the Los Angeles Flower Market and City Hall.
 

The system operates in a manner similar to Metro’s Bike Share program.
To access a vehicle, users press either a Metro TAP card or a BlueLA card to a central kiosk at each hub (BlueLA cards are mailed to users after they register).
The card enables a user to remove the charging cord from a car, unlock it and drive away.
People can use the cars for as long as they want, provided they stay within 25 miles of a charging station and the battery does not run out. The system allows the service to call users and ask them to turn around if they get too far away. When the charge hits 30%, BlueLA notifies the driver to return to a hub.
 The cars can travel 160 miles on a full charge in an urban area, Arnaud said. To end the session, users return the vehicle to a hub, lock it and plug in the charging cord.

Similar to Metro’s Bike Share, an app allows drivers to see where cars are available and book a vehicle in advance. The service provides auto insurance coverage, but it is secondary to a driver’s personal auto insurance. Tickets are the driver’s responsibility, and users must work with BlueLA’s insurance provider in the event of an accident.
The cars have GPS tracking, navigation service on a display screen, and a car-return system that highlights stations that have an available space for drop-off.
BlueLA is one of approximately half a dozen car-sharing services operating in the Los Angeles area. The company Getaround launched in Los Angeles in March, and allows people in Downtown and other neighborhoods to rent out their personal vehicles.
Getaround General Manager James Correa said there is a high demand for car sharing services in the city, and there is room for many options to meet demand. He sees a growing user base in neighborhoods known for congestion and limited parking.
“It’s a trend in general for urban dwellers who are eschewing car ownership,” Correa said. “If there are more providers in the market, it’s good. More people are learning and experimenting with car sharing.”
There are other local options, too. General Motors brought its car-sharing service, Maven, to Downtown in 2016. Then there’s Zipcar, which has a number of stations and a variety of company-owned vehicles around Downtown.

With Uber already operating, Lyft is looking to hire a general manager and marketing manager for Alberta, according to a job posting.
In a statement Saturday, the San Francisco-based company said they don’t have specific launch plans, but are looking to build a team to one day bring the service to the province.
“We want to bring Lyft’s affordable, reliable rides to Alberta and are beginning the process of building a team in anticipation of an eventual launch,” the statement said.
“While both Calgary and Edmonton would be great fits for Lyft, we have no specific launch plans to share at this time.”
Coun. George Chalal is willing to welcome Lyft into the Calgary market with open arms, but wants to see some disparities in Calgary’s private transportation industry cleared up first.
“The City of Calgary is open for business, but anybody who is looking to come into the industry should be ready and willing to ensure that it’s fair for everybody,” said Coun. George Chalal, who added he sees a disparity of cost, fees and training between the taxi industry and the transportation network companies (TNCs).

“I think we need to reevaluate the whole livery industry, TNC and traditional taxi industry. I’m willing to work with both sides of the industry over the next few months and year to find common ground and solutions which enable everybody to thrive and be successful.”
Chalal also expressed concern about safety issues, given that taxis have camera and audio recording devices, while other ride-sharing options in Calgary do not.
Tentative changes were approved during a April 11 council meeting including eliminating a $141 setup fee charged to taxi drivers for the inspection of meters, along with an increase to the amount of money that cabbies can recoup from patrons who make a mess in a taxi from the current $100 charge to $250.
The rookie northeast councillor said he plans to introduce stiffer regulations for ride hailing companies at Monday’s council meeting.
Like Chalal, Coun. Shane Keating, who serves as the chair for the city’s transportation committee, sees a market for Lyft but also a need to balance differences between companies.
“As we have seen, there is a market for it,” said Keating.
“We still have to balance the difference between the taxi industry and TNC industry. In the long run, it will provide better service to Calgarians.”
According to data from the city, a total of 2,282,276 trips were taken with ride-share companies like Uber in 2017.
Taxi use, meanwhile, continued to decline, with 6,650,069 trips logged in the year, down from a total of 7,022,090 taxi trips in 2016, and 8,404,108 rides in 2014.
The same date found monthly taxi revenues based on distance have decreased, falling from $10,488,078 in September 2015 to $8,876,873 in September 2017.
Lyft announced last year it would begin its expansion into the Canadian market. The company currently operates in hundreds of U.S. markets and in nine Ontario cities that include Toronto and Ottawa.

Tauranga’s worsening traffic woes have prompted a carpooling movement among frustrated motorists who have “had enough”.
Former Aucklander Josh Cole is running a Tauranga car pooling Facebook page, aimed at getting more people to share rides in and out of town. The CAR Pooling Tauranga/bop page was created on January 31 and has more than 80 people following it.
Another page set up for Welcome Bay commuters on Thursday has already attracted more than 100 members.
Cole, who is on the road for work regularly, said traffic had become much worse.

“I mean, it’s getting really, really bad. We’re basically a mini-Auckland. We’ve also noticed a lot of the cars are single occupancy – especially in Welcome Bay,” he said.
Last week, Tauranga commuters complained the traffic was the worst they had experienced with some in Welcome Bay taking 45 minutes to travel a typical 10-minute journey.
Cole “grew up in wops” in Auckland’s Waitakere Ranges so is familiar with the need to look after the environment, but also with diabolical traffic woes.

“By giving people the choice whether to carpool or to have another car on the road, we hope to reduce our traffic problems,” he said.
Cole said creating more roads was not the answer.
“It’s not what we need. We need more people sharing cars, a better public transport system and more people on bikes. Tauranga is really easy to bike around if you have better, protected, cycleways.
“People have had enough of traffic, that’s for sure. In Auckland, they were very slow to learn and look at the problems they have now. Their public transport system is shocking. I just watch it get worse and worse and worse and not wanting that for Tauranga. Especially as more Aucklanders move down here, bringing their traffic issues with them.”
People are invited to join the page and post a blurb stating what their commute is, how often and at what times. Cole hoped the page would become an active forum for people sharing rides.



Welcome Bay car pooling page creator Erica Wilson said she thought online carpooling sites would work better based on suburbs rather than across the whole city.
She envisaged that carpooling would appeal to Welcome Bay commuters and parents who drove their children to school. She did not think Bayhopper buses offered enough of an incentive to lure people out of their cars because of the slow progress caused by bus stops.
Wilson could not be reached in time before publication.
Nationally, council and transport agencies work together to run a Smart Travel website, which shows precisely what transport options are available to people in their location. This includes carpooling options, matching destinations with people who have registered their travel schedules.
In Tauranga, several carpooling options can be found but only for some destinations.

New Zealand bus and transport company Go Bus today marked a Southern Hemisphere first as Savy hit the road in Queenstown.
Using a smart phone app and the efficiencies of ride sharing, Savy will provide on-demand and affordable transport around Queenstown for the introductory flat fare of just $5.
Savy is powered by Via, the leading technology developer and provider of dynamic on-demand shared rides. First launched in 2013, Via powers over 1.5 million rides per month in major cities around the world including New York, Chicago, Washington DC, Paris, and Kent in the UK.
Queenstown is the first location in New Zealand, and indeed the Southern Hemisphere, to get Savy.
Users simply book a ride through the Savy app and are instantly matched with others going their way in a dynamically-routed Savy vehicle.
Savy is also different from other app-driven or shared-ride transport services in that it owns its fleet and employs only fully trained and officially vetted and endorsed drivers.
“Savy combines the ride-sharing efficiency of a bus, with the personal convenience of a taxi, all at an affordable price and in a way that’s quick and easy to use,” explains Calum Haslop, Managing Director of Go Bus, the New Zealand transport operator behind Savy.

“We’re confident Savy fills a gap in the transport options currently available, sitting in a space between traditional public transport, taxis and community carpooling that is now more accessible through technology.
“In Queenstown, Savy answers to the area’s challenges around providing transport offerings that are suitable to both residents and visitors, growing traffic congestion and dwindling carpark availability.

“These challenges are not unique to Queenstown of course, and we see plenty of scope in adopting this global solution to help address local transport issues in other New Zealand centres in future.”
Savy utilises Via’s smart algorithms, which seamlessly match multiple passengers headed in the same direction, and dynamically routes entire vehicle fleets in real time to meet demand. Via also developed the Savy rider and driver mobile applications, as well as state of the art operations management software.
“Our ground-breaking technology transforms public transit from a system of fixed routes and schedules into a dynamic on-demand network.
By allowing more people to share rides, Via is helping reduce congestion and emissions around the world, from New York to Paris, and we are excited to bring this successful model to Queenstown,” says Daniel Ramot, Co-founder and CEO of Via.
Savy officially launches today in Queenstown with a fleet of six Savy vehicles on the go seven days week. Operating times accommodate early starts and late nights out: 6am to 11pm Sunday to Thursday, and 6am to 1am Friday and Saturday.
The current service area covers the Queenstown area including Arthurs Point in the north, Fernhill to the west, Kelvin Heights to the south and east towards Lake Hayes, with plans for expansion in the future. One-way trips are charged direct to the rider’s debit or credit card via the Savy app at an introductory flat fare of $5.
Go Bus is New Zealand’s biggest and most diverse bus operator, with 27 depots spanning the North and South Islands. It is 100% New Zealand-owned by Ngai Tahu Holdings Corporation and Tainui Group Holdings.  
The company offers a full spectrum of bus services, including metropolitan urban routes, school bus services, Special Needs Transport, tour and charter services. Go Bus provides contracted urban bus services to more regional authorities in the country than any other operator.

 It operates a fleet of over 1,700 vehicles, including over 440 dedicated urban service buses, and employs over 2,000 staff.

Beijing-based bike-sharing company Ofo is set to launch its service in Israel this week. The service will be available in Ramat Gan, a city adjacent to Tel Aviv, the City of Ramat Gan announced.
Chinese bike-sharing company, Beijing Mobike Technology Co. Ltd., announced Monday it would launch a free pilot program on the Tel Aviv University Campus. As part of the pilot, hundreds of shared bikes will be positioned on the university’s campus.
500 bicycles by Ofo will be positioned throughout Ramat Gan, as well as inside the Sheba Medical Center and the Bar-Ilan University in the city.
Ofo’s intention to enter the Israeli market was first reported by Calcalist in July.

Founded in 2014, Ofo operates over 10 million bikes in 250 cities worldwide and has some 200 million users. Unlike similar services in Europe and the U.S., Ofo’s operational model does not include docking stations, and users unlock the bike by entering a code into an app on their phones. In July, Ofo raised $700 million in a funding round led by Alibaba.
Imri Galai, CEO of Ofo Israel, said in a statement that Ofo bikes would be available in additional cities in Israel in upcoming months.
Mobike offers a station-free bike sharing service operated via a smartphone app. Founded in 2015, Mobike operates in over 200 cities worldwide and has tens of millions of users.
In 2017, the company began operating outside China in Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, Italy, the Netherlands, Australia, and the U.S. Mobike has raised nearly $1 billion in investments in 2017 and is backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd.

Mobile announced its intention to enter the Israeli market in February, partnering with Israeli car-sharing company Car2Go Ltd.
Mobike has already imported 2,500 bikes to Israel and expects to operate thousands of bike across Israel within the year.

In a February statement, Mobike said its service would initially be offered in the towns of Rishon LeZion and Rehovot in central Israel, and in the Krayot town cluster in the country’s north.
Mobike also said it would not be offered in the Tel Aviv area, where the city’s bike-sharing service Tel-O-Fun is already operating.

As controversy continues around dockless bikes and other vehicles cluttering sidewalks in San Diego, scooter operator Bird is floating a code of conduct it hopes rivals will adopt to ease tensions over the emerging technology.
Bird CEO Travis VanderZanden wrote an open letter to his counterparts at four bike sharing companies urging them to join him to “Save Our Sidewalks” by signing on to a three-pronged pledge that he says would help American cities avoid the plight of “out-of-control” bike sharing deployment in China. Huge piles of abandoned and broken bikes overrun the sidewalks in that country, he said.
The plan unveiled Tuesday calls for repositioning bikes and scooters based on rider demand, limiting the number deployed to city streets and donating $1 per vehicle per day to cities in which the companies operate.
Bird’s proposal came the same day KPBS broke the news that the Little Italy Association has been using its maintenance crews to remove shared bikes from that neighborhood’s center and line them up on a sidewalk adjacent to Interstate 5. The association’s side-by-side placement of the bikes has at times blocked portions of the sidewalk.
Ofo, one of the main dockless bike-sharing companies in San Diego, said it would not join the pledge and derided Bird’s proposal as motivated by self-interest. Ofo spokesman Taylor Bennett said Ofo is “actively” working with the Little Italy group to address its concerns.
“We encourage Bird to join us in working together with local governments before launch and support cities’ desire to have a framework for safety in place before new products are released to the public,” Bennett said.
Both companies have a track record of entering markets without official permission. The city of Santa Monica in December filed a criminal complaint against Bird, accusing it of operating without a license and refusing to comply with city citations, including orders to remove scooters from sidewalks.

 
Bird pleaded no contest and agreed to pay more than $300,000 in fines and secure a proper business license. The company’s agreement with that city also required it to run a public safety campaign on public buses, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Ofo similarly dropped a fleet of its own yellow bikes on the UCSD campus last year without asking university officials for permission. The university kicked the bike sharing company off campus and has since signed a partnership with rival bike sharing company Spin.
In San Diego, the main bike or scooter sharing companies operating in the city — LimeBike, Ofo, Mobike and Bird — hold the required business tax certificate, according to the mayor’s office.
A Bird representative said the company “wants to work with cities on our shared goal of reducing traffic and carbon emissions. That is why we continually engage with the cities, campuses and communities in which we operate, and make sure that we are following all the rules of the road — just like any other business.”
A spokesman for the San Diego mayor’s office said the city has sent letters to each operator to ensure they’re aware of the state and city laws that pertain to their businesses, including laws governing bikes, scooters, property and business activity in the public right-of-way and activity in public parks and beaches.
“We appreciate the proactive approach the dockless bike-sharing companies are taking to address concerns raised by residents and businesses,” said Greg Block, a spokesman for Mayor Kevin Faulconer.
Dockless bikes proliferated in San Diego after the city attorney in January cleared the companies to operate in the city.
The City Council has not considered any new rules regulating the businesses, though existing laws prohibit parking bikes or scooters in a way that blocks pedestrian or vehicle traffic.
In his Tuesday letter, Bird’s CEO said the company would pick up all of its scooters from city streets every night to inspect and repair vehicles as necessary and reposition the scooters “to where the vehicles are wanted the next day, so they are not cluttering our neighborhoods.”
The company also pledged that it will not increase the number of vehicles in any city unless they are being used on average at least three times per day and will remove any underutilized scooters.
Additionally, VanderZanden offered to provide city governments $1 per scooter per day “so they can use this money to build more bike lanes, promote safe riding, and maintain our shared infrastructure.”
A spokeswoman for the City Attorney’s Office said that proposed arrangement appears to be a donation to the city, which must be made in accordance with the City Council’s donation policy and reviewed by the city’s lawyers.
The policy stipulates that donations must be used for city business, though donations can be restricted for certain purposes by the donor.
VanderZanden urged his counterparts at LimeBike, Ofo, Mobike and Jump to sign onto the pledge, but so far none have done so, according to Bird.

Car sharing is catching on in the country, especially among millennials, many of whom cannot afford to own a car because of the rising cost of living or who are too environmentally conscious to do so.
Car sharing is a relatively recent phenomenon in Malaysia. It is the next version of the car rental service, one that can be accessed through an app on a smartphone. The cars — be they new or peer-to-peer — can be hired for a few hours, a day or several days.
Enterprise spoke to four car-sharing app founders and CEOs to get a feel of the local market and some of the challenges they face in bringing this service to this market.
Moovby was the first such app to be introduced in the country. The peer-to-peer service came about when co-founder and chief technology officer Nik Muhammad Amin let a junior at university use his car to attend a convocation and got paid for it. “It was a lightbulb moment for me,” he says.
Nik started doing research on the car-sharing industry, trying to figure out if it was time to bring it to our shores. He decided to attend a Malaysian Global Innovation & Creative Centre (MaGIC) road tour to look at the possibility of setting up a business and it was here that he met Nadzri Sazali, co-founder of the company. “We attended MaGIC’s programme in Sabah and we invited another friend, who was good at product design, to help out,” he says.
After four months of being incubated by MaGIC, the trio received a RM150,000 grant from the Cradle Investment Programme (under CIP50), which enabled them to develop Moovby. The Cradle Investment Programme provides financial assistance to entrepreneurs to help them start technology-based ventures.

Kwikcar co-founder and CEO Jared Chan, on the other hand, was inspired to start his peer-to-peer car-sharing service on one of his visits back to Malaysia. He was living in Australia and when he came back for the holidays, he found readily available and appropriately priced rental cars difficult to come by.
So, he started Kwikcar for others like him who thought rental cars in the country were too overpriced. He believes he can achieve affordable rentals through this peer-to-peer car-sharing service. Having done his research, he knows that there are plenty of cars sitting idly in garages or parking lots that are ideal for such a service.
“Malaysia has the third highest ratio of cars per household in the world. Some 93% of all households in the country own a car and there are about 11 million passenger vehicles that are stationary for more than 20 hours a day,” Chan points out.
GoCar’s founding story is similar to that of Kwikcar. Founder TJ Tan was inspired to start the service when he came back for a vacation (also from Australia). He found the process of renting a car in
Malaysia unnecessarily tedious.
GoCar CEO Alan Cheah says its service offers a lot less hassle as those who want to rent a car can do so via its app. Tan started worked on the app in March 2015 and launched it in February the following year.
The new kid on the block, as far as car-sharing apps in the country go, is Socar. This app took off in South Korea and the company is hoping to replicate its success in Malaysia.
Most of these apps are only available in the Klang Valley, with the exception of  GoCar, whose services are also available in Langkawi. However, the concept is slowly catching on in the rest of the country. Drivers from Penang, Johor, Sabah and Sarawak are already trying to register themselves or their cars on these apps.
Socar is providing a test run of its “door-to-door” service (meaning that it delivers the car to your doorstep) in the Bangsar area for a flat fee of RM5. “You can choose where you want to pick up the car in Bangsar within certain hours and you drop off the car anywhere in Bangsar, also within certain hours,” says Socar Malaysia CEO Leon Foong.
Socar and GoCar provide brand-new car fleets for their car-sharing services. Socar charges RM8 per hour for its cheapest model, a Perodua Axia, while GoCar charges RM14.90 per hour for its cheapest model, the Nissan Almera.
GoCar’s fleet is supplied by the Mayflower car rental business. Cheah points out that GoCar’s fleet of cars belongs to the company as it finds the peer-to-peer model rather messy, with a lot of legal and insurance issues. “We are not heading into that until the issues are resolved. Right now, we have more than 180 cars. But we are adding cars every month. In fact, we are adding almost 50 cars a month,” he says.
“We have a huge variety of cars, from the Nissan Almera to seven-seaters for families and four-wheel drives. These are the most popular cars among the community. Our cars are either Nissans or Renaults.”
As for the peer-to-peer car-sharing services, prices vary depending on the car make. There is a large variety of cars provided, from regular sedans to sports cars with up to 700 horsepower.
However, there are special rules for those who want to rent the more expensive cars, imposed by the service providers or the car owners themselves.
Helping millennials
Car sharing may be the best thing for millennials who want the freedom of driving without the burden of a car loan. But for those who choose to own their own car, such services could also help them with the loan.
“By renting out their cars every weekend, they can pretty much cover their car loans. That is really good because 25% of all millennial bankruptcy is due to unpaid car loans,” says Kwikcar’s Chan.
For instance, if someone lists his Perodua Myvi on Moovby, it will earn him about RM104 a day. If he rents it out four weekends a month, he could earn enough to pay for his loan, with a little left over as well.
But car sharing does not only earn those willing to participate extra pocket money. It is also good for the environment. A study conducted among 363 car-sharing respondents in the Netherlands, “Mobility and environmental impacts of car sharing in the Netherlands”, found 30% less car ownership among car sharers who also admitted that they drive 15% to 20% less than they did prior to car sharing.
According to the study, the shared cars mostly replace a second or third car. With reduced car ownership and car use, car sharers emit between 240 and 390 fewer kilogrammes of carbon dioxide per person, per year. This is between 13% and 18% of the carbon dioxide emissions related to car ownership and car use.
 
Insurance policies and safety
Moovby’s Nik admits that he had a hard time finding an insurance service provider that was on the ball or which kept up with the latest trends to insure cars and drivers. He went round to most of the insurance companies in Malaysia and was usually turned away with the usual reply: “I’m sorry, we do not provide such policies.”
He did not despair, however, and finally met the right insurance service provider. Allianz has been keeping up with most of the start-up trends and was the first insurer willing to come to the table and talk business.

Michael Fong, head of digital partnerships and innovation at Allianz, says the insurance coverage it currently provides car-sharing services in Malaysia is for personal accident and roadside assistance. He adds that since the company was already looking at ride sharing, addressing the needs of car-sharing providers was a natural progression.
“Because this is not vehicle attaching (which means the insurance is not attached to a specific vehicle but to the person driving the vehicle), it does not contravene any regulatory restrictions. So, it is allowable to provide personal accident coverage for the driver as well as roadside assistance. I think this is really to take away some of the risks and challenges these platforms share,” says Fong
In Australia, for example, you can buy additional cover for your private car for ride and car sharing. “This allows you to do Uber and Grab and also put your vehicles on car-sharing platforms such as Kwikcar or Moovby,” says Fong.
He adds that Allianz goes the extra mile to ensure that the solutions provided are compliant with the provisions of regulators such as Bank Negara Malaysia and the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD).
“So, both regionally and locally, we are supportive of new economy start-up platforms because we are passionate about local entrepreneurs and start-ups,” says Fong, adding that there is also an environmental dimension to this.
“In Europe, car and bike sharing has alleviated the number of vehicles on the road. People have really moved from ownership to users. They take public transport and use car sharing for the last mile.”
Other than insurance, car-sharing service providers have put their own safety measures in place. Socar and GoCar, for instance, have a keyless unlock button that connects you to the app and permits an individual to unlock a car and start it.
Foong says when it comes to the safety of the car, many features can be installed to prevent theft or vandalism. But this mostly depends on a community’s mentality. “We leverage our members’ understanding of the principles behind car sharing, which means taking care of the car, not just preventing car theft but keeping it in good condition.”
Moovby has developed its own smart Internet of Things kit. “This kit is actually an advanced telematics kit installed in all Moovby cars. It can automate the locking system, start and stop the engine and provide real-time GPS as well as behaviour-tracking,” says Nik.
As for Kwikcar, a similar telematics device is installed in the cars. The idea is that the device will not just allow the company to track the car but also furnish it with data on consumer behaviour (how the car is used and where they are travelling, in terms of distance and location).

Chan says this provides Kwikcar with important data on peak demand times for the cars. “It gives us aggregated and not individual data.”
With four car-sharing services already in Malaysia, one may be forgiven for thinking that the market is getting a little crowded. But GoCar’s Cheah does not think so. “If you are looking at the long game, there is plenty of room for improvement, provided that the players focus on improving our transport ecosystem, rather than just coming in for commercial purposes,” he says.
Chan does not believe that car sharing will become obsolete with the introduction of new technologies such as self-driving cars, but he does think the business model may need to be tweaked over the next 5 to 10 years to keep up with the changes.
After all, car sharing is on trend. Nik says according to research by Navigant Research, worldwide membership in car-sharing programmes will grow from 2.3 million in 2013 to more than 12 million by 2020 as this model of shared personal transport is seen as a potential solution to global gridlock.
Self-driving cars
Though autonomous cars have yet to make a big impact on the world market, everyone agrees that it is just a matter of time. Where will that leave the car-sharing business?
Socar’s Foong, for one, is excited about autonomous cars. “We look forward to partner leaders in that space to offer car-sharing members even greater benefits. We are amazed by the possibilities and believe that car-sharing platforms will be a natural partner with our data and understanding of travel and traffic patterns.”
Cheah agrees, saying that autonomous vehicles will remove the line between car and ride sharing. The legislation, however, will need to catch up. “We need to prepare for the upcoming changes in the transport landscape as the introduction of autonomous vehicles will require fundamental changes to infrastructure, policies and mindsets.”

Indiana State University is launching a new bike-share program that’s powered, in part, by the sun.
ISU purchased around 130 bicycles from the San Francisco-based company Spin. People can rent a bike for 50 cents every half hour by using a phone app.
Sustainability Coordinator Nick McCreary says what makes the ISU bike share different is the bikes don’t have to be returned to a charging station.
Instead, instead solar panels in the bikes’ baskets power the GPS.
“These can be parked and picked up anywhere because the lock is built into the back of it,” McCreary says.
“Basically all you do is you download the spin app and you put your information in and then you scan the back of the bike, it’ll unlock, then you ride.
And then you lock it when you’re done.”
McCreary says he wants to get more students active.
“Students might think a five minute walk is too far but a one minute bike ride isn’t, so hopefully it’ll spread students out and get them to drive less,” he says.
The bikes can only be used on campus. McCreary says they’re working with the city of Terre Haute to expand the program city wide.

For now, the ISU bikes can only be used on campus (Zach Herndon, WFIU/WTIU News)

Didi Chuxing, a major ride-sharing company from China that provides transportation services for hundreds of millions of users, on Monday was used to illustrate what is the “sharing economy” during a UN event in Geneva.
“Didi is so well known in China. In 2017, Didi completed 7.4 billion rides. It has 450 million users in China and in only five years Didi has become a huge platform,” said Jianhua Li, Chief Development Officer of Didi Chuxing, at an event titled “Development Dimensions of the Sharing Economy — Learnings from China”.
“We started as a taxi-connecting platform. In China, you can make a reservation through the Didi app,” he said.
“Development Dimensions of Digital Platforms,” is the theme of the fourth E-Commerce Week organized by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) which started Monday.
It explores the growing role of digital platforms and concrete steps to harnessing these evolving technologies for sustainable development.
UNCTAD said that it has been estimated that the so-called “sharing economy” will surge from 14 billion US dollars in 2014 to 335 billion US dollars by 2025, and the interest in its implications for development is also surging.
“Most services relating to the’sharing economy’ use digital platforms to achieve a more efficient utilization (‘sharing’) of physical assets (e.g. house, car, physical space, machinery, clothes) or time,” says UNCTAD in a statement.
It can be applied to cooking, cleaning, or running errands, as well as knowledge and know-how.
Often, sharing economy activities involve an exchange of money as well as the creation of some employment.
“At Didi, we don’t have cars, we connect people,” said Li, noting that development is key to the company.
“We have about 10,000 employed in the company who are engineers,” said Li. “We think what we are doing is consistent with the goals of the United Nations and with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).”
“Some people are surprised that this platform has provided 21 million jobs opportunities,” said Li. “We pay people weekly… so we can help reduce poverty and have a positive impact on the general economic environment.”
The sharing economy can meet “people’s increasing demand for a better life” as well as the requirement for “a coordinated development among economy, society and nature,” and thus can become a key force in China’s economic growth and social development, according to an official from China Cyberspace Administration at the event.

A ridesharing platform specifically for older adults has hired a senior living veteran to help it grow.
Scottsdale, Arizona-based Envoy America on Tuesday announced it has named Tiffany Wright as its new director of business development.
In her new role, Wright will be tasked with growing the company’s market share in the senior living, health care and religious institutions market segments.
Wright has approximately 25 years of experience in marketing and business development, many of which were spent in the senior care space.
For instance, Wright has worked as a community sales manager for Louisville, Kentucky-based senior housing provider Atria Senior Living; as president of Senior Lifestyle Connections, a senior referral service; as owner of Morningstar Assisted Living, an assisted living and memory care community in Atlanta, Georgia; and as an outreach manager/skilled admission director at Chicago-based senior housing provider Vi.
Most recently, according to her LinkedIn profile, Wright worked as the director of business development at a Rapid Recovery Center operated by Mainstreet Health in the Phoenix, Arizona, area.
In March, Carmel, Indiana-based Mainstreet Health announced it had decided to pull all of its Rapid Recovery Centers of the Arizona market, laying off 70 workers.

Envoy America operates a mobile application and ridesharing platform that matches seniors in certain Arizona markets with drivers.
These drivers can take seniors to and from a number of places, including medical appointments, religious services, outings with friends and shopping malls.
Envoy America’s services differ from those offered by popular ridesharing platforms Uber and Lyft in that Envoy drivers continue to accompany their passengers after they arrive at their destinations.
This may include helping the passengers identify the correct suite at the doctor’s office or pushing the passenters’ carts at the grocery store, according to the company’s website.
Additionally, seniors who wish to use Envoy’s services can call ahead of time to set up their rides or reserve a ride online.
Many senior housing providers, including Brentwood, Tennessee-based Brookdale Senior Living (NYSE: BKD) have embraced Lyft as a worthwhile transportation option for residents.
In June 2017, the nation’s largest senior housing provider announced it would be scaling up a pilot with Lyft, ultimately offering Lyft services at 25 communities nationwide.

With gas prices on the rise around Metro Vancouver you may be one of the many people looking to get into a car share service.
While it’s hard to say whether their increase spike interest is a direct result of soaring fuel prices, one company says it is hearing from members about it.
“I can tell you anecdotally that we do get lots of member feedback around gas pricing, and those saying that they’re using Evo car share more because of the spikes in gas and the overall increases in vehicle ownership,” explains Tai Silvey, director of Evo.
He adds the company has seen a steady rate of sign-ups since it became available a few years ago, and the number of vehicles in their fleet has also increased significantly.
Gas prices were pushed even higher this month after a hike to BC’s carbon tax. This comes after fuel prices hit an all-time high in Metro Vancouver this past March.
The pain at the pumps has forced many to look at alternatives when it comes to transportation. Depending on how you look at it, that could include car shares.

“This might be part of the high cost of living in Vancouver, including gas prices, but Vancouver is really the car sharing capital of North America,” Silvey tells NEWS 1130. “There are more cars per 100,000 people here than anywhere else in North America and the overall market continues to grow. So, as costs get more expensive here, the addition of Evo in this market has just… vastly expanded the number of people who use car sharing, and we continue to see that month over month.”
He adds jumps aren’t just seen in memberships, but also in usage.
Evo offers a pay-by-minute system and all vehicles are hybrids. That, Silvey says, means they don’t have to look at raising fees to correspond with higher gas prices. “We consume far less fuel than your average compact vehicle, so it has a much less of an impact on our overall operations. So no, we have no intention of increasing our costs due to increasing fuel costs.”
On Apr. 1, the BC NDP increased the carbon tax by $5/t, right before the summer driving season when prices go up anyway. There will be an increase of 1.2 cents a litre annually for the next four years.
The goal of the levy is to have BC achieve its 2050 emissions reduction target (80 per cent below 2007 levels by 2050.)

Following in the tire tracks of other automakers, Nissan Motor Co. will introduce a car-sharing service, which allow registered members to rent and share vehicles, in January.
Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. have also put the pedal to the metal and entered the car-sharing business.
Nissan on Dec. 8 began accepting membership registrations on the website of its service, which the company has named “e-share mobi” (https://e-sharemobi.com).
For the time being, the company will keep one vehicle–either of its Leaf electric model or a gas-electric hybrid variant of its Note compact model–at each of its 30 or so stations to be located in nine prefectures, including Tokyo and Osaka.
A driver’s license card with an embedded IC chip will be used to unlock a car, whose rental fees start at 200 yen ($1.77) for 15 minutes.
Car-sharing services are catching on with customers for their convenience of use, which does not require a formal storefront.
The Times Car Plus service, operated by market leader Park24 Co., had 20,000 cars available at 10,000 stations across Japan as of the end of October 2017.
Compared with five years earlier, the number of stations had grown threefold, the number of vehicles had quadrupled, and the number of memberships had increased six times.

Honda began test-operating a car-sharing service in Tokyo in November 2013. It keeps a total of 140 or so vehicles at 90 or so stations and has 11,000 registered members.
Toyota has acquired a stake in a U.S. business venture that operates a peer-to-peer car-sharing service, with which the automaker is test-operating a car-sharing system.
Both Nissan and Honda are offering their “pick-of-the-bunch” models in their car-sharing operations. They are hoping that use by a broad customer base will lead to stronger subsequent sales of its automobiles.
For those worried about making an impression by showing up in a rental: Park24 on Dec. 8 released survey results showing that 52 percent of 20-somethings said there is “no problem” in going on a date in a rented or shared car.

PORTSMOUTH, Va. (WAVY) — Transportation — or lack thereof — was a big issue during and after last week’s snow storm.
The storm left behind a mess on the roads, dropping between 5 and 10 inches of snowfall in certain areas.
This led to many neighborhoods being snowed-in and services like Hampton Roads Transit to cancelling operations.
Ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft played a big role in making it possible for some to get around the region.

10 On Your Side’s Joe Fisher rode around with Uber driver Patricia Nicholson, who put in more than 50 hours on the roads following the storm.
Nicholson says she’s made good money, but also adds it’s about more than that.
In one trip, she took a child with respiratory problems to Children’s Hospital of the King’s Daughters (CHKD).
She says it was important to make sure people got to their destination safely.
“After taking that woman to the hospital and realizing that law enforcement can’t get to some people in the time that they would like to, I just feel like military, people at the hospital, anyone that needs, they have to get to where they need to go.”
Nicholson says surge pricing helped earn more than $1,000 since the storm.

He calls himself “The Rideshare Guy” and he’s become one of the more prolific voices covering the still-burgeoning business.
When Uber and Lyft were at the point in development that they were considered by some to be just another fly-by-night constituent of the gig economy craze, Los Angeles-area engineer Harry Campbell started driving part‑time for both app-based firms and he also started a blog on ridesharing.
As a structural engineer working on fleetwide problems for Boeing Co.’s 757 aircraft, he was doing well for himself. But in a short amount of time, his ridesharing blog took off, so three years ago he quit his day job to focus on the blog full‑time.
The blog, which has everything from articles to podcasts to YouTube videos, currently reports 500,000 views a month.
Eventually, the blog launched a video training course to help educate rideshare drivers on subjects that range from getting started to how to make more money as a driver, and it also has a running list of insurance carriers that offer rideshare insurance.
The Rideshare Guy spoke with Insurance Journal on ridesharing matters that our readers may have an interest in. This has been edited for brevity and clarity.
Insurance Journal: Can you talk about how ridesharing has changed in the last two or three years?
The Rideshare Guy: One of the biggest changes we’ve seen in the past few years is that rideshare has become mainstream. I think that when you start to hear your parents and your grandparents talking about Uber and Lyft, you know that the companies have really made it.
When these services were first starting, it wasn’t a sure thing that they were going to take over like they have. Uber has grown into a worldwide brand. It’s become a service that’s extremely popular with drivers, with passengers, and consumers. That’s what we’ve seen, an explosive growth and probably not going to stop any time soon.
IJ: What some of the hot button issues in ridesharing today?
The Rideshare Guy: Coming from the perspective of a driver, one thing we’ve seen over the past three years is that rates have actually come down significantly. You probably notice this as a passenger consumer that taking an Uber around the city is now cheaper than ever. It’s up to 50 to 70 percent cheaper than a taxi in many large cities. That’s great for consumers and passengers, but definitely a downside for the drivers is that they’re obviously making less than ever.
We surveyed over 1,100 drivers earlier in the year. They reported making an average hourly earnings of $16. That’s actually before expenses. Drivers, since they’re independent contractors, they’re responsible for gas, and maintenance, and depreciation on their vehicle and even rideshare insurance. They have to cover all of those costs.
You can see that the trend is that the pay for these drivers is getting closer to more of a minimum wage or a service type job even though not everyone has that impression.

IJ: What would you tell our insurance professional listeners about ridesharing that they should know?
The Rideshare Guy: One of the shocking stats that I see is that most drivers don’t have rideshare insurance. We’ve surveyed our audience and seen, depending on the surveys we’ve done in the past, 60 to 80 percent of drivers don’t have rideshare insurance.
That provides for a big issue for drivers just because they receive coverage while they’re en route to a passenger or while they’re on a trip.
They actually don’t have coverage when they have the app on and they don’t have a passenger yet, when they’re waiting for a passenger. Personal insurance won’t cover that. Uber and Lyft only provide state minimum liability and no collision coverage.
That speaks to what we see with drivers in general. You have a lot of drivers that get into working for Uber and Lyft, just looking to make a few hundred bucks a week. They’re just looking to do a side hustle. They’re looking to make some part‑time cash.
Of course, you also have full‑time drivers. But I think a majority of drivers are doing about 10 to 15 hours a week or less.
You have a lot of people who aren’t aware that they might even need rideshare insurance. They aren’t aware of the reporting and the tax requirements. There’s a big education component.
IJ: How can insurance agents approach drivers to educate them and even drum up a little business?
The Rideshare Guy: If you listen to that stat that a majority of drivers don’t have rideshare insurance, a lot of agents have seen that as a pretty big opportunity.
For insurance agents that are out there listening, I think that there’s actually some pretty easy steps that you can take. The most obvious would be when you’re in an Uber and Lyft, talking to drivers, asking them about their insurance situation, and just helping them understand and educate them as opposed to selling them on the rideshare insurance.
We get lots of emails from drivers who get into accidents and don’t realize that Lyft had a $2,500 collision deductible. If you’re a State Farm agent for example, State Farm actually provides rideshare insurance that will cover you even if you’re on a trip. You won’t ever have to worry about Lyft’s collision deductible. That education component is definitely important, taking rides with drivers.
But also going to the places where drivers hang out. This could be airport lots. Drivers have to sit in a queue waiting for rides at the airport. There might be 50 to 100 drivers sitting there for up to an hour that are very bored and very attentive.
Then, there’s also places like after a sporting event. I’m here in Los Angeles. Towards the end of Dodger games and Rams football, there are hundreds of drivers out there waiting for the game to end so that passengers can come out. They can get their ride. There’re definitely places if you go out there and do a little looking.

Would you let your child use a rideshare app? A newly-launched program in Denver hopes so.
HopSkipDrive has expanded to Denver after running for about three-and-a-half years in California.
Founded by three working moms, including one Denver native, the rideshare service is like Uber for kids. Families can schedule rides for their children online or through the app, but it must be done at least eight hours in advance. It serves kids ages six and up.

“If you know of a certain day you’re going to be need a ride for your kid to school or activities, you can arrange that ride as far in advance as you want so you know someone will be there to pick your kid up and bring them to their next location,” Kelsey Kuenstler, HopSkipDrive Operations Associate for Denver, said.
The people behind the service realize the issue of safety is a main concern. According to Kuenstler, all drivers go through an extensive background check and interview before being hired, and parents receive a picture of the driver, their full bio, and a history of their child care experience.
“We have a two-way verification process, so not only is the driver able to verify this is the correct child, but the child is able to verify that this is the correct driver,” she said.

“Children with their parents come up with a word like ice cream or pizza, something specific to that child and parent that they know, and then that driver is giving the code word to the child so the child knows that’s the driver that’s supposed to be driving them to wherever they’re going next.”
Angela Coleman was scrolling through Facebook when she saw a post from HopSkipDrive on her feed. After going through the background check and interview process, she is now a driver.
“My first ride was Monday. It was awesome and it was a lot of fun,” Coleman said. “I went to a dance studio and to a home, and dropped off a very nice individual. We listened to some Broadway show tunes along the way.”
Coleman is a mother and understands the safety concerns. She said she did a lot of research about the service and advises others to do the same before using it.

While the “sharing economy” based on communal use of items and spaces has rapidly expanded in China with ride-sharing and other services, sudden service interruptions and unreturned deposits are also rising to the surface.
In July 2017, China‘s largest bookstore operator Anhui Xinhua Distribution Group Holding Co. opened a “sharing bookstore” at the Sanxiaokou Xinhua Bookstore in Hefei, Anhui province .
After downloading a smartphone application, if users made a deposit of 99 yuan (roughly 1,700 yen), then they could check out books for 10 days from the store free of charge. After the 10-day period, 1 yuan per title is charged.
Users can easily read the newest releases, including mystery novels by Keigo Higashino that have gained popularity in China, and the bookstore can also attract a large number of new customers.
In just half a year, the company has expanded the sharing bookstore to 28 locations throughout the country, and users of the app have reportedly exceeded 250,000 people.
“We get positive responses from users like, ‘The bookstore has become a library,'” says Anhui Xinhua publicity manager Lu Qing.
What have also become increasingly common sights in China are “shared umbrellas” concentrated around subway stations. If a user inserts a refundable deposit into the machine, they can use an umbrella for free, only paying an additional fee if they are late in returning the item.
The Chinese have a great affinity for the sharing economy as the use of smartphone apps for making purchases has spread widely around the country, and services originating in North America and Europe like car-sharing, renting rooms in private accommodations and ride-hailing also quickly caught on.
With many new ideas like jewelry and shopping cart sharing, just like the bicycle sharing service already operating in over 20 countries, the sharing economy has given birth to new business opportunities originating in China.
The scale of the Chinese sharing economy in 2016 grew 3.5 trillion yuan compared to the previous year, and had a total of 600 million participants.
The word for “share” in Chinese, “gongxiang,” even made it on the list of China’s top 10 buzzwords of 2017, and President Xi Jinping praised the expansion of the sharing economy as “a new driving force (for the economy),” setting it up for success nationwide.
However, expanding to the size that it has, problems are also rising to the surface. Fierce competition to lower prices for bicycle- and car-sharing has led to worn-out operators abruptly halting services, and problems with deposits not being returned are occurring one after the other.
One business sharing smartphone chargers expanded quickly for a period of time before its popularity died out, forcing the operator to restructure and retire the service. There are also many cases where companies offering ride-hailing and housecleaning services have not signed clear contracts with employees, and trouble involving wage payments and accident management occur frequently.
The National Development and Reform Commission of the People’s Republic of China and other main agencies released a statement about the government’s stance concerning the “sharing economy” in a broad sense in July 2017, and created rules for things such as the strengthening of monitoring systems. “Gongxiang is a ‘new force’ in China’s economy,” it said, “but it is also facing many problems with the system and lack of security.”
These problems with the system aren’t limited to China, but extend overseas to the U.S. and Europe. A major representative of the sharing economy, ride-hailing service provider Uber Technologies Inc., has come under fire for a variety of problems, including drivers assaulting passengers, leading to the service being banned in London and other cities.
Whether or not these types of services can handle the side effects of their rapid growth is an issue the whole world, including Japan, is watching carefully.

Uber users in Los Angeles will have a new way to hail a ride, starting today. The company’s Express Pool service, piloted last year in San Francisco and Boston, is now available to customers in Los Angeles.
The Express Pool system allows customers to trade the convenience of being picked up wherever they are for a more “consistent experience,” says Ethan Stock, director of product for Uber. To make trips more efficient, the app will often ask users to walk to a set destination so that drivers don’t have to go too far out of their way to find them.

That makes it even more comparable to traditional public transit than Uber’s Pool service, which launched in 2014 and offers users the opportunity to save on the cost of a ride by picking up other passengers along the way to their destination.
The new option is designed to iron out some of the wrinkles in the Pool system, which has been criticizedby drivers and riders alike for its unpredictable matchmaking system, which often leads to long detours and circuitous pickup route.S





By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.





Users may also have to exercise a bit of patience when ordering a ride using Express Pool. Stock says passengers can expect to wait for 1 to 2 minutes while the app pairs them with other riders traveling along a similar route.
Riders will get a significant discount by using the Express Pool option. Uber estimates that trips with the new system will be around half the price of a Pool ride and up to 75 percent less than the conventional UberX option, in which just one passenger hails a ride to a single destination.
The new system sounds quite similar to a “microtransit” program that Metro wants to create through a public-private partnership.
Meant to give system riders more flexible service—as well as a new way to travel to and from larger transit stops—Metro’s program would also rely on smartphone technology and would allow passengers to get picked up along flexible routes that could change depending on rider demand.
Cities around the country have started experimenting with microtransit systems to supplement rail and bus networks that are harder to rework and customize on the fly. In the small city of Altamonte Springs, Florida, the local government is even subsidizing Uber to provide rides to the local light rail station.
In a 2015 blog post, transit consultant Jarrett Walker suggested that microtransit services could provide a valuable supplement to conventional public transportation networks—if providers are willing to cooperate with, rather than compete against, local transit agencies.
Stock says Uber’s new service will help transit agencies by giving riders easier access to transit hubs and that the company has already coordinated with Cincinnati on a possible partnership.
Asked whether the company had contacted Metro about the new service in Los Angeles and how it could fit in with the agency’s transit goals, Uber spokesperson Stephanie Sedlak tells Curbed that the company has already seen riders using the Pool option to get to and from stations in Los Angeles.
“We commend Metro’s continued commitment to ensuring Angelenos have access to multiple and complementary modes of shared transportation solutions,” Sedlak said.
Metro spokesperson Dave Sotero says the agency was not aware of the new Express Pool option.

Public transit officials in cities across the United States are trying to find ways for ride sharing to complement existing public transit options or those in the development pipeline, while others worry that ride sharing could replace public transit altogether. That shift is already starting.
A recent survey conducted by the University of California, Davis found that ride sharing services resulted in a six percent reduction in Americans’ use of bus systems and a three percent reduction in Americans’ usage of light rail services.
Studies of New York and other cities suggest that Uber, Lyft, and other app-based car services are increasing congestion and air pollution by facilitating a shift away from mass transit.
But some independent-thinking cities are offering on-demand ride sharing as an alternative to high-cost rapid transit.

One of the first in the United States is Arlington, Texas, a growing city of 380,000 people located between Dallas and Fort Worth.
Last December, in partnership with the Via rideshare service, Arlington began a pilot program supported by the Arlington City Council and the citizen-led Transportation Advisory Committee.
The rideshare pilot replaced the Metro Arlington Xpress commuter bus line, which was taken out of service on December 31, 2017.
The Via service area initially covers downtown Arlington and the City’s Cultural Arts District, the University of Texas at Arlington, the Entertainment District, and the area around Arlington Memorial Hospital. Summer expansion plans call for coverage of the airport, commuter train stations and major retail destinations.
Customers can book a seat in a six-passenger Mercedes-Benz van through the Via app or by phone, and Via’s sophisticated technology can match them with others going their way in a kind of riadesharing car pool. Wheelchair accessible vehicles are available. Rides are $3 per trip.
The contract is for one year, with four one-year renewal options. The City of Arlington will pick up one-third of the pilot project’s cost, about $322,500, with the rest coming from the Federal Transit Administration.
Data collected through the rideshare pilot will help shape the City Council’s future transport planning decisions.

“We are at the beginning of an exciting transportation technology revolution,” said Mayor Jeff Williams. “Arlington’s Via Rideshare Pilot Program is the latest example of our city’s willingness to explore innovative transportation technology solutions for our residents, employees, students and visitors.”
Arlington also will be a test city for self-driving cars. The U.S. Department of Transportation has named Texas a national Automated Vehicle Proving Ground for the testing of connected and automated vehicle technologies.
Automated vehicles aren’t the only type of innovative transportation technology being explored in Arlington.
In January, the city announced a data-sharing partnership with Waze, the free, real-time crowd-sourced traffic and navigation app powered by the world’s largest community of drivers.
Designed as a free, two-way data share of publicly available traffic information, the Connected Citizens Program promotes greater efficiency, deeper insights and safer roads for the drivers of Arlington along with more than 100 other partners around the world.

A first for Saskatchewan and for Canada – a 100 per cent electric and solar powered car sharing program launched Tuesday in Saskatoon.
It’s part of the CarShare Co-operative that already exists with two regular gas-powered vehicles in its fleet in the Broadway neighbourhood.
The new solar powered electric car’s home base is a charging station in the City Park neighbourhood.
The co-operative has plans to add additional electric cars in the near future.
“Usually they have about 140 kilometre driving range,” Allyson Brady, with the Saskatchewan Environmental Society, said during Tuesday’s unveiling.
“In the winter that range is a little lower so that’s something we want to be aware of.”












The vehicles are accessible to anyone who is interested for a 25 cent per kilometre fee and an hourly rate with a one-time $500 to $750 membership or, for casual drivers, the membership fee is waived but they’re charged a $10 monthly fee instead.






“People generally will use the vehicles for short trips like going to get groceries or maybe heading to a meeting on the other side of town,” Saskatoon CarShare Co-operative co-ordinator Megan VanBuskirk said.
By adding this new car to the fleet, VanBuskirk anticipates this will help grow the co-operative’s membership of 70 people.

Pony.ai has become the first company to offer the public self-driving car rides on city roads in China, having launched an autonomous ride-sharing fleet.
Showcased at an event in Nansha, attendees experienced Pony.ai’s fully self-driving cars on a 2.8km route.
In addition to trial rides, the event also consisted of a signing ceremony that solidified a strategic partnership between the young company and China’s second-largest carmaker, Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC Group).
Commenting on the changing mobility landscape, President of GAC Group, Xingya Feng, explained: “The current global automotive industry is in the process of undergoing profound change.
Automotive products are rapidly becoming smarter, more connected and more lightweight whilst harnessing innovations in alternative energy. Against an ever-progressing backdrop of smart mobility and intelligent transportation, I believe this partnership between GAC Group and Pony.ai will spearhead innovations in automotive and beyond.”
The autonomous cars have already undergone road tests covering thousands of kilometres. Within three months, the autonomous driving platform has learned to deal with unique road scenarios such as congested city streets, extreme weather and unexpected road behaviour.
These scenarios have pushed the Pony.ai team to enhance and refine their algorithms, creating a more sophisticated AI system that is capable of handling more complex road conditions.

The route featured three consecutive lane changes on Phoenix Boulevard, large multi-lane intersections and bridge-crossings involving sloped roads.
Starting at the Nansha Government building, the cars immediately turn onto Phoenix Boulevard – the major traffic roadway of Nansha.
Pony.ai and GAC Group plan to work closely together to make progress in research, development and manufacturing. Their strategic partnership agrees to collaborate in four key areas: further development of self-driving technology, autonomous vehicle operationalisation, broader mobility development and capital partnership.
Harry Hu, COO of Pony.ai, commented: “This partnership has the potential for meaningful global impact and influence. We look forward to working with GAC Group to deliver the most reliable, safe and comprehensive autonomous vehicle experience to the public.”
Tiancheng Lou, co-Founder and CTO of Pony.ai, added: “This year we continued our efforts in research and testing and ultimately realised a breakthrough in autonomous vehicle technology. We are thrilled to give Guangzhou citizens their first opportunity to experience self-driving cars.”

Just six months ago, Bird created an electric scooter sharing program in Los Angeles, California. It’s received a $100 million raise as investors believe it can become the biggest player in the industry. With the money, the last-mile service plans to launch in 50 new cities by the end of the year.


New Series B funding took place less than a month after receiving $15 million in the middle of February. It’s grown incredibly popular over the past half-year in Los Angeles due to the ease of picking up and using the dockless e-scooters. Over in China, the scooter’s established growth has created more sustainable transportation.


“I think it speaks to how big of a vision this is, to use short-range electric vehicles and electric-scooter sharing to replace a lot of car usage,” Travis VanderZanden, CEO and founder of Bird, told the Financial Times. “It’s a huge opportunity to have a big impact on the world.”


Investors are hailing Bird to be “the next Uber” in ridesharing, though the structure of the business between the two are quite different. However, Uber had just a fraction of what Bird made in their Series B funding, which was $32 million in 2011. It also happened 18 months into their lifespan, a year further along than Bird.

 


The process of using an electric scooter through Bird is pretty simple. Using their mobile app, one can be traced and reserved.
Then, a detailed description on how to safely ride the e-scooter to a specified destination spans across multiple screens.
In the evening hours, various Birds laying around are picked up and moved to a storefront that accepts hosting them.


An issue of following basic traffic laws in California has cropped up during its short run. While Bird says they don’t have control over it, the City of Santa Monica believes they shouldn’t be able to ignore laws such as not wearing a helmet and having a license for a motorized scooter.
Despite potential for the city to limit the service, these issues haven’t stopped a massive amount of funding on the project.


On the positive side, Bird provides an environmentally friendly last-mile service. Unlike Uber and traditional vehicles, these scooters don’t give off any carbon emissions.
They’re also very beneficial to urban areas that want to decrease the amount of vehicles on the road and university campuses that are spaced out.


Bird joins various other electric scooter and bike sharing startups that are looking to cash in on the trend. However, they may have a leg-up on the competition with how cheap it costs to use the e-scooters ($1 per ride and $0.15 per minute) and the massive funding they received.
They’re looking to expand to over 50 cities by the end of the year. Most of their targets will be in the US, but they will be looking toward other places around the world as well.

A Chinese carmaker has launched a vehicle sharing service in Shenzhen by offering a special deal on rental prices that works out cheaper than bike sharing.
GoFun, a car-sharing platform backed by state-owned Shouqi Group, said has put 300 new energy vehicles into service in the southern Chinese city, considered to be China’s Silicon Valley.
The rental cost is just one yuan (US$0.16) per kilometre plus 0.1 yuan per minute, which works out at about half the cost of using Chinese ride hailing service Didi Chuxing. However, new customers can take advantage of a special deal of one yuan for three hours of driving, which is even cheaper than bike-sharing services in the city.
“It is a common strategy for technology companies to use low prices or even free services to attract new users,” said Zhao Ziming, a senior analyst at Beijing-based consultancy Cyzone. “The price will go back to normal when the companies gain a certain market share.”
Carmakers like Shouqi Group are looking to develop vehicle sharing services based on the assumption that future consumers would rather make short-term use of those assets than owning them outright. In February, Didi Chuxing teamed up with 12 Chinese carmakers to develop an electric-vehicle sharing platform.
Shenzhen has a high demand for shared vehicles because only one in 300 people with driving licences can obtain the hard to get licence plates needed to purchase vehicles, said Tan Yi, chief operating officer of GoFun.
After launching vehicle-sharing operations in more than 40 Chinese cities, GoFun now has 1 million monthly active users. Jack Liang, a 30-year old teacher in Beijing, said he prefers using the car-sharing service at railway stations or airports because there is always long queue for a taxi.

“But in my daily life, I prefer using car-hailing service, not driving the shared vehicles by myself,” he said. “It is difficult to find an available car as well as parking. However with a car-hailing service I can get out wherever I want.”
To ensure Shenzhen doesn’t have the same problem, Shouqi said it will have 1,000 vehicles on the road in the city by the end of this year and will rent more dedicated Go Fun parking spaces.
A report from DongXing Securities said the sharing-vehicle business requires high initial investment and operating cost, so most players won’t make a profit in the current environment.
“These who can lower the vehicle production cost or who have cutting-edge technology are more likely to win out ” said the report, which expects the shared vehicle market in China to be worth 9.28 billion yuan in 2020, up from 820 million yuan in 2017.
Unlike China’s ride hailing market which is dominated by Didi Chuxing, there is currently no strong leader in vehicle sharing.
“Vehicle sharing is a niche market and the service, to a large extent, is complementary with the car hailing business,” said Zhao.

The new Mercedes-Benz A-Class (earlier post) is already set up for private car sharing: Mercedes me allows the new compact car to be shared with friends and family members. Operation is simple and secure using the Mercedes me app Car Sharing.
According to the German Car Sharing Association, more than 1.7 million people in Germany are registered with providers such as market leader car2go.
Mercedes me is now extending its services to include private car sharing: the Mercedes me app Car Sharing allows A‑Class drivers to share their vehicle with a specified group of users. Friends, family members or colleagues can then easily book the A‑Class for a fixed period of time.



The authorized user opens the vehicle using the app and by means of the Mercedes me communication module installed in the vehicle. The A‑Class is started with the vehicle key, which is left in the car and temporary use of which is likewise enabled over the air by Mercedes me.
When returning the vehicle, the driver puts the key back in the car and closes the car with the app, thereby bringing the sharing period to an end. The vehicle key in the car can be used only during the sharing period.
The car can also be contactlessly opened, closed and started by means of Near Field Communication (NFC).
This technology is used by the Digital Vehicle Key. The new A‑Class is now also available in Germany with a Digital Vehicle Key Sticker with a built-in NFC controller. This means that the use of the Digital Vehicle Key no longer requires an NFC-capable smartphone.
First launched in the E‑Class, the Digital Vehicle Key is now available as an optional extra ex-works for a number of model series. However, not every smartphone has an NFC interface that complies with Mercedes-Benz’s security standards.
For the new A‑Class, therefore, there is now a Digital Vehicle Key Sticker with a built-in microcontroller. Customers can order this sticker from the Mercedes me portal. Delivery is through a Mercedes-Benz sales partner.
Once stuck on the smartphone, the Digital Vehicle Key Sticker allows contactless opening, closing and starting of the vehicle.
To start the engine, the driver simply needs to place their smartphone with the NFC sticker in the center console stowage tray. Qi-compatible smartphones, i.e. those with a corresponding receiver coil for wireless charging, are also inductively charged while in the tray.
NFC is an international communications standard for short-range wireless data exchange. Data transfer begins automatically when an NFC-capable device is held close to another device.
The Digital Vehicle Key from Mercedes-Benz transfers the authorization to drive the vehicle to a secured and encrypted chip in the phone or sticker. This can then be used as a car key. The Digital Vehicle Key Sticker is also available for a number of car lines in conjunction with digital vehicle key for smartphone.

Taxi companies across Japan are working with ride-hailing apps to enhance efficiency, improve customer convenience, and to keep up with global changes in the market.
Sony Corp. and six major taxi firms including the Tokyo-based Checker Cab Group announced on Feb. 20 that they were collaborating on the development of a ride-hailing service. 
The service will makes use of Sony’s artificial intelligence (AI) technology, and is expected to reduce passenger waiting times and the time it takes drivers to find customers by assessing demand based on such factors as the weather. The companies plan to unveil a smartphone app in autumn, with further plans to provide the app to other taxi companies in the future.
Daiichi Kotsu Sangyo Co., based in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka Prefecture, has similarly started talks with both American firm Uber Technologies and Chinese company Didi Chuxing about collaborating on a taxi-hailing service.
Uber, a global ride-sharing powerhouse, was initially looking to deliver a similar service in Japan, but uncertainty about when a current domestic ban on ride-sharing will be lifted has shifted the firm’s attention to taxi-hailing technology. The American company has said it is considering working with other Japanese taxi firms, claiming that its ride-sharing knowledge gained from working in more than 70 countries is its forte, enabling it to operate in numerous languages.

On Feb. 8, Nihon Kotsu Co. announced its plan to form a capital alliance with Toyota Motor Corp.
Its popular ride-hailing app has already been downloaded 4 million times, giving the firm the edge over its competitors, and it is looking to improve further, making use of AI.
The number of taxi users has continued to decline in recent years, with 1.47 billion rides counted in fiscal 2015 — a drop of about 40 percent compared to fiscal 2005 — and taxi companies are increasingly fearful that people will demand that the domestic ban on ride-sharing be lifted. This has promoted them to come up with ways to improve customer convenience.
The taxi industry kicked off a “ride-sharing taxi” experiment on Jan. 24, as a preemptive measure against regular ride-sharing. However, low usage and a lack of awareness have hindered progress of the experiment.
“A ride-sharing taxi could not be found for you.” This was the message received on a weekday in late February during a Mainichi Shimbun attempt to find a ride-sharing taxi with the Nihon Kotsu app.
The app searches for people going in the same direction as a given taxi, and the seeker can board the vehicle if a suitable vehicle is located. According to Japan Taxi Co., which oversees management of the app, “There are lots of users at night.” However, a Mainichi attempt to find a ride-sharing taxi at night was also unsuccessful.
The main selling point of ride-sharing is that fares are 20 to 40 percent cheaper than when riding alone.
According to Nihon Kotsu and Daiwa Motor Transportation Co., which have been taking part in the experiment, feedback from customers who have managed to get on ride-share taxis has been favorable, with Nihon Kotsu saying, “It’s been popular due to the low fares.”
Neither company has released data on the number of users, but according to Daiwa Motor, “The number of users has not been high.” As a result, Nihon Kotsu intends to improve its app, by introducing real-time notifications on people looking to share a ride, and where they are located.
According to a source in the taxi industry, Daiwa Motor Transportation, which pre-arranges ride-sharing pick-up points, raised the number of pick-up points from 30 to 50 in a bid to increase customer use.
Industry experts say that the reason for sparse customer usage of ride-share taxis is due to low awareness about such services and the reluctance of many people to ride with strangers.

Students who want to learn more about The Ohio State University’s role as a smart campus in the heart of a smart city recently filled a classroom to hear from the leaders of the effort.
Smart Campus, a student organization partnering with the university’s Center for Automotive Research, hosted leaders from the city of Columbus, Smart Columbus, CAR, the university’s Technology Commercialization Office and the Transportation Research Center this month in Scott Laboratory.
“We have a campus that rivals in size some of the smaller cities in the nation. With that, we have the unique opportunity to operate in a microcosm where we can test and find solutions that can then be extended to cities around the nation,” said Cameron Luther, co-founder of Smart Campus.
The Smart Campus organization is working to help students from across the university find ways to collaborate with the Smart Columbus initiative and engage in campus projects tied to a connected campus.
In 2016, Columbus won the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Smart City Challenge, beating out 77 cities. The win secured $40 million in grants from the federal government and another $10 million from Vulcan Inc. Ohio State is the lead researcher on the project.
While the initiative, and the grant money tied to it, lasts for only a limited time, research at Ohio State will continue to make Columbus a smarter city.
“The reality is, here at Ohio State, because of the awesome faculty, staff and students, we’ve been really engaging in smart cities research the entire time depending on which definition we use,” said Courtney Falato, Smart Cites relationship director at Ohio State.
Falato said automotive research and connected devices are only part of what it means to be a smart city. She referred to a quote that put the research in context.
“So even though smart seems to be synonymous with technology, certainly it goes way beyond technology. What does it accomplish and how does it improve the lives of citizens?” Falato said.

Currently, Smart Columbus projects are focused on using technology to improve the Columbus community. One effort includes developing a common payment system for transportation so people across the economic spectrum can take advantage of public transportation, ride sharing or other services. Another is working to develop a way to provide more flexible and reliable transportation to expectant mothers using Medicaid-based services.
“(Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther) believes that transportation and mobility is the great equalizer of the 21st century,” said Brandi Braun, deputy innovation officer for Columbus. “We want to ensure that we approach smart mobility and smart city technologies in a way where we are not widening the gap between Columbus’ haves and have-nots.”
Jordan Davis, director of Smart Columbus at the Columbus Partnership, told students that future advances in technology should lead to reduced congestion and a cleaner environment. It will also simplify mundane tasks like shopping for groceries or picking up dry cleaning.
“I think of mobility as a service in its simplest form. How can we use the sharing economy and how can we use technology to make mobility work for them,” Davis said.
Luther encouraged his peers to become active in the opportunities offered by the Smart Campus program.
“We’re right in the center of an amazing moment,” he said. “I really encourage all of you in the room that are here to take that opportunity by the horns.”

When constructing the ideal schedule, travel time can easily be overlooked. As a result, students always find creative new ways to get across Grounds to class. One mode of transportation that has become increasingly more common is the Boosted board.
Boosted boards are a specific brand of electric skateboards. At their top speeds, they can reach 12 or 13 miles per hour. The charge lasts about seven to eight miles.
“Realistically, for most people using the mid-speed level … it gets you anywhere from eight or nine miles on a good day,” said Yash Tekriwal, a HackCville staff member and fourth-year College and Commerce student.
Borne out of HackCville, Boost Cville creates an easily-accessible electric skateboard ride share program for all students. Boost Cville is located on Elliewood Avenue — convenient for students living both on- and off-Grounds.
“It’s essentially our version of bike share in some ways, but instead for Boosted boards,” Tekriwal said. “For us, Boosted boards are an easier way to get around Charlottesville specifically as a city. The terrain is really good for a board.”
“It’s a great sustainable form of transportation,” said Allison Garrett, a HackCville staff member and fourth-year College student. “But electric skateboards are really unaffordable for the average college student. Boost Cville aims to provide electric skateboards at a cheaper rate for students to rent.”
If you have never skateboarded before, Boosted boards are easy to learn. In fact, Tekriwal cites the Boosted board’s ease of use as a leading factor in the creation of Boost Cville. Tekriwal and fellow HackCville member Daniel Willson got their own personal Boosted boards, but neither knew how to skate. They were able to learn within 10 minutes.
“We thought about the ease of learning it and also the amount of fun we had being able to go around the City relatively quickly,” Tekriwal said. “We thought about how we could get more people doing this rather than just getting our friends on it all the time, and we thought we could make a little Boosted board share.”
 
Boost Cville includes a free helmet rental with the board rental. While the company emphasizes the ease of operating the Boosted board, they also stress the importance of knowing turn signals, riding in the bike lane and wearing a helmet for safety purposes.
Garrett assures new riders will be given resources to feel prepared before their rental.
“We send out an email with all of the information you need for a new rider,” Garrett said. “We do a free 30 minute lesson for each new customer in which we show them how to ride a skateboard [and] how the remote works.”
“They’re pretty safe, as long as you’re being careful about where you’re going on the road,” Tekriwal said.
Boost Cville provides an alternative form of transportation for students getting across Grounds, the company also makes it easier for students to explore other parts of Charlottesville.
“A lot of people talk about how there’s a gap between the University of Virginia and the Charlottesville community,” Garrett said. “I think Boost Cville is really aiming to bridge that gap by providing students with a form of transportation to help them explore Charlottesville.”
Garrett recommends a day pass to explore the Downtown Mall and IX Art Park. Tekriwal said Boost Cville has been most popular for dates or for adventures with friends downtown or to the Belmont area, but he personally benefits most from on-Grounds transportation.
“The biggest advantage to me has actually been that it makes going to and from class a lot faster,” Tekriwal said. “It was fast to go down the road on a board, and I could take that board with me inside the classroom and just pin it up against the wall, which is pretty convenient.”
Boost Cville runs out of HackCville on Elliewood Ave. The company rents out Boosted boards for one hour, two hours or day passes. The price ranges from $10 for one hour to a $25 day pass. You can buy a pass from their website. After purchasing a pass, the company sends an email.
“From there, you can make an inquiry for the actual rental and the time you want the rental for,” Tekriwal said. “If anyone wants to inquire for other times, they’re welcome to talk to us because our emails are also on the website.”
For those who are interested in checking out the Boosted boards, Boost Cville will host demo days in the spring.
“It’s been a fun project for us to work on, and fun to see how people react to it,” Tekriwal said. “We’re excited to see how it works when the weather gets warmer.”

The advent of Uber in cities across the country has reduced per capita ambulance volume by at least 7 percent as low-risk patients likely opt to avoid the more expensive ride with paramedics, according to a working paper co-authored by a University of Kansas economist.
“In order to lower health care spending while improving health outcomes, people can use the least-skilled professional who is still qualified,” said David Slusky, assistant professor of economics. “It’s the same in the provider space: you don’t need a neurosurgeon to diagnose strep throat.”
With emergency room patients who are too sick to drive but who don’t need medical care during the drive, an Uber would suffice. An ambulance ride can cost someone or their insurers hundreds to even thousands of dollars.
“Many patients don’t need something that can break traffic laws and don’t need something staffed by paramedics with a bunch of fancy equipment,” Slusky said.
Slusky and co-author Leon Moskatel, of the Department of Medicine at Scripps Mercy Hospital in San Diego, examined ambulance rates in 766 U.S. cities across the country in 43 states as Uber entered their markets from 2013 through 2015.
In those cities comparing before and after Uber became available, the ambulance usage rate decreased at least 7 percent.
Slusky said an alternate explanation some researchers have examined is whether Uber reduced the need for ambulances because Uber availability reduces the number of crashes or drunken drivers or both. However, he said the evidence is still too mixed on that to believe that less drunken driving is the drop’s primary reason.
The more likely explanation, Slusky said, is that people who need emergency care but not an ambulance now have another option to safely transport them to the hospital. Ambulance trips are costly to patients and their insurance companies, so people likely look for a way to avoid them, if possible, he said.
One potential policy implication could be insurance companies encouraging patients to consider taking an Uber — possibly by offering them a $50 gift card or something comparable — instead of calling an ambulance or at least educating them about other transport services as a potential option, Slusky said.

Other than the expense, a potential benefit is that Uber usage could reduce wait times for remaining ambulance volume, meaning people who really need ambulances get them faster.
“Given that even a reduction of a few minutes can drastically improve survival rates for serious conditions, this could be associated with a substantial welfare improvement,” the researchers said in the paper.
Slusky said it’s important to conduct this type of research to uncover unintended consequences of Uber entering a market. Transportation services are especially valuable in the context of the high cost of American health care.
“We want to find every way possible,” he said, “to bend the medical cost curve.”

Ride-sharing service is no longer just a pipe dream in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, as people can now use mobile apps to easily get a motorbike delivered to their doorstep in minutes.
A handful of companies have already started app-based on-demand motorcycle ride-sharing services in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country, which are known for inadequate road systems and public transport services.
In Dhaka, one of the most densely populated cities in the world with a population of about 15 million, a substantial portion of the day’s working hours are wasted on the streets due to traffic jams, which indirectly adversely impacts the country’s economy.
Against this backdrop, app-based motorcycle ride-sharing service providers like Pathao have proved to be quite popular as they take users to their destinations by threading through the heavy traffic.
Rizwan Ahmed Rafi works in a private company. He regularly rides a motorbike and can swiftly skim through traffic.
“My office is located at Banani in Dhaka. Every day I have to come to the office and in the past it was very difficult to get here,” he said.
“I had to use three or four different modes of transport for just one journey. I’d use buses and rickshaws. Sometimes it was unbelievably difficult,” he added.
He said the buses were so crowded and slow due to the heavy traffic that it almost made no sense catching one at all.
“Thankfully, the app Pathao has made my commute to work far more easy these days and along with other uses we can be far more productive at work, because we can save so much time that was once wasted stuck in traffic,” Rafi said.
He added that upon sending a request via the app just before leaving home or his office, a rider would arrive and swiftly drop him off at his desired location.
“There are no problems with the fees as the service is relatively inexpensive. As well as being a more efficient worker I can also spend more time with my family. It’s certainly a win-win,” he said.
For rider Asif Ahmed, the service created an opportunity for him to earn some extra money before and after office hours.
Ahmed likes to work as a rider as he can work according to his own schedule.
“I am a private service provider. Every day, I share a ride on the way to the office and on the way back from the office. By working this way I earn 15,000 taka (about 180 U.S. dollars) a month,” he said.

For Sabnaz Afroz, a female rider who began to work as a rider in 2017, such a service came as a big blessing.
“This is because when I was a student in Dhaka, I had a lot of problems in earning money for my studies,” she said, adding that, “it helped me a lot as a source of income.”
“I’ve finished my degree and I am now studying for my master’s without having to worry too much about money,” she said.
Operators said the ride-sharing services are fast-gaining popularity in urban areas with the rise of both users and riders day by day.
Riaz Uddin Ahamad, director and head of rider acquisition at Pathao, said app-based ride-sharing services have not merely benefited the riders and their users but also the entire motorbike industry.
He said motorbike traders are benefitting from the growing popularity of the services.
“So far I understand the demand for motorbikes, especially those from China, are on the rise in Bangladesh. Chinese companies like Lifan are now exporting more products to Bangladesh,” he said, adding that “due to the reasonable prices of Chinese motorbikes, our younger generations can better afford to buy them.”
“And with their Chinese motorbikes they can engage themselves with the app-based on-demand motorcycle ride sharing services,” said Ahamad.

The debate around ride-sharing services came to Saskatoon Tuesday, as the union representing taxi drivers descended on city hall ahead of a discussion over rules for services like Uber, Lyft or TappCar.
About 20 people gathered for the United Steelworkers rally at City Hall Square to demonstrate taxi drivers’ concerns over the possible introduction of companies like Uber and Lyft to the province.
“The only reason we are standing for two hours, losing our income on the road, is to tell the city the direction (they) are going will ruin our business,” taxi driver Hassan Abbas said.
The 17-year veteran of the industry added most drivers have a low monthly income to begin with, despite regularly working 12-hour shifts every day of the week.
He said having Saskatoon streets flooded with part-time ride-share drivers would destroy his livelihood.
“The main source of income for Uber drivers is not Uber,” he said.
“They’re not making a primary income, whereas a taxi driver spending 13 hours on the road is trying to make a living.”
Abbas said like many other drivers, he had taken a line of credit against his home to purchase a taxi plate — an item that sells for approximately $250,000 in Saskatoon, according to advocates.
He said unless city council approves rules limiting the introduction of ride-sharing services, his purchase will be worth nothing.
“I would have nowhere to go,” he said.
Abbas joined several of his colleagues in council chambers throughout the afternoon as councillors on the transportation committee discussed a Saskatchewan Taxi Cab Association (STCA) proposal to allow “flex fleet” cab drivers to increase the number of taxis available at peak times.
STCA spokeswoman Shondra Boire said the part-time fleet would use private vehicles with window decals to identify their cab company, and the cars would only be called upon when the full-time taxis couldn’t keep up with demand.
“We realize we can’t service the people properly with the number of cars we have,” she said.
“Our hands are currently tied given the number of taxi licences the city gives out.”
Boire added the flex-fleet cars would have security cameras, and drivers would be subject to the same criminal background checks as other taxi operators.
City administration recommended the councillors direct staff to develop a comprehensive ride-for-hire bylaw, analyze ways to make the taxi fare system more affordable or to approve the drafting of the part-time flex fleet taxi licensing system.
Another option was to develop an independent ride-sharing bylaw that would regulate companies like Uber in the interim, until more comprehensive laws involving taxis could be drafted.
However, councillors on the committee opted to pass along recommendations to gather more research on how bylaws could maintain a “level playing field” between taxis and ride-sharing services.
If city council approves the recommendation at its Dec. 18 meeting, administration would report its findings back sometime in 2018.
Ward 6 Coun. Cynthia Block said people in Saskatoon need a more efficient, affordable option.
“I think there’s a very good chance we can find a way to develop a system that’s good for everyone,” she said.
“It won’t be the same, but it could be good for everyone.”
After several taxi managers and drivers addressed the committee to implore them to either restrict or ban companies like Uber, Ward 5 coun. Randy Donauer told them it would be a losing battle.
“We could maybe delay them by a year or two, but they’re coming,” he said, noting he won’t vote in favour of bylaws allowing ride-sharing until rules putting taxis on the same level are also in place.

Following in the tire tracks of other automakers, Nissan Motor Co. will introduce a car-sharing service, which allow registered members to rent and share vehicles, in January.
Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. have also put the pedal to the metal and entered the car-sharing business.
Nissan on Dec. 8 began accepting membership registrations on the website of its service, which the company has named “e-share mobi” (https://e-sharemobi.com).
For the time being, the company will keep one vehicle–either of its Leaf electric model or a gas-electric hybrid variant of its Note compact model–at each of its 30 or so stations to be located in nine prefectures, including Tokyo and Osaka.
A driver’s license card with an embedded IC chip will be used to unlock a car, whose rental fees start at 200 yen ($1.77) for 15 minutes.
Car-sharing services are catching on with customers for their convenience of use, which does not require a formal storefront.The Times Car Plus service, operated by market leader Park24 Co., had 20,000 cars available at 10,000 stations across Japan as of the end of October 2017.
Compared with five years earlier, the number of stations had grown threefold, the number of vehicles had quadrupled, and the number of memberships had increased six times.
Honda began test-operating a car-sharing service in Tokyo in November 2013. It keeps a total of 140 or so vehicles at 90 or so stations and has 11,000 registered members.
 

Toyota has acquired a stake in a U.S. business venture that operates a peer-to-peer car-sharing service, with which the automaker is test-operating a car-sharing system.
Both Nissan and Honda are offering their “pick-of-the-bunch” models in their car-sharing operations.
They are hoping that use by a broad customer base will lead to stronger subsequent sales of its automobiles.
For those worried about making an impression by showing up in a rental: Park24 on Dec. 8 released survey results showing that 52 percent of 20-somethings said there is “no problem” in going on a date in a rented or shared car.

Jai Allen says cab service in Winnipeg is lacking.
“Last time I was on vacation came back from the airport had to tell the guy how to get there he was on his phone half the time,” said Allen.
Allen is training to be a TappCar driver now that ride sharing is permitted in Winnipeg as of March 1.
“I’m semi-retired something to do, meet some new people give them an opportunity for a better taxi ride,” said Allen.
TappCar is one of three ride sharing companies authorized to operate in Winnipeg now. Cowboy Taxi and InstaRyde are the others.
TappCar says it expects to train 500 drivers by month’s end, with 50 cars on the street Friday.
“It’s a big response here, this market is pretty good for the ride share,” said Balraj Manhas of TappCar, adding that expectations are high.

In response to the new competition, taxi cab industry is vowing to offer the best service for customers. Duffy’s and Unicity said they’re making several changes to increase safety and service including:

Enhanced driver training
The creation of an advisory council to handle customer complaints
Moves to repair relationships, specifically with members of the Indigenous community
A pilot project using collision avoidance technology.

“We can’t control what our competitors are going to do, we can only control what we’re going to do. And we’re upping our game,” said Scott McFadyen of the Winnipeg Taxi Community Coalition.
Some of the potential major competitors remain on the sidelines.
Uber and Lyft won’t ride into Winnipeg. They have concerns about MPI’s insurance model. But both companies had representatives in the city Thursday to let people know they still want to operate here.
“We want Winnipeggers to know that we’re ready to launch, but for some concerns with the MPI ride sharing product,” said Chris Schafer, Uber Canada.
Mayor Brian Bowman hopes the hurdle can be cleared, but is pleased there will be some ride sharing options available.
“I’m hoping it’s the beginning of many more choices in the market place, and time will tell if Uber and Lyft enter the market place,” said Bowman.

A revamped online service can help local residents find someone to share a ride with — whether it’s a regular commute to work or a one-time trip to Denver International Airport.
Mountain Metropolitan Transit’s newly-improved “RidePro” database helps users find others they can carpool with by matching registrants based on their travel schedules, origins and destinations.
With the rising popularity of smartphone apps like Uber and Lyft, the transit authority wants to cater to those looking for cheaper, more environmentally-friendly ways to get around.
“Ridesharing is a pretty hot topic these days,” said Vicki McCann, a Mountain Metro spokeswoman. “You can see that there’s a need out there for people to use other modes of transportation besides just single occupancy vehicles, and we thought it was important to make that easier to do.”
As of last month, the system included nearly 4,000 users.
“Vanpools” are another option available through the service. Under this mode of transit, the agency provides vans, vehicle maintenance, fuel and insurance to commuters who are headed departing from and heading to proximate locations. Mountain Metro has 25 vanpools, most of which travel from Colorado Springs to Denver with others going to the Pueblo Chemical Depot and Schriever Air Force Base.

Residents can also use the search engine to look for others to bike to work with or plan a trip on the bus system with real-time information on scheduled arrivals and departures provided through Google Maps. The service allows users to track how much money they save by using public transportation, biking or carpooling instead of driving solo.
While the carpooling database has been around since the mid-2000s, the upgrade was finished last year and recently cleared the beta testing stage, McCann said.
The new service is faster and more convenient, said Kelli Frazier, program manager for the city’s Metro Rides, which includes RidePro. Under the old system, a commuter would have to call a coordinator with the agency and later be notified if someone registered in the database shared a similar route.
“With the new system, they can just go onto the website, punch in their information and if there’s someone else in the system that matches with them, they will know that right away,” Frazier said.
RidePro is a product of the Trapeze Group, which markets transportation software to transit agencies.
The upgrade cost Mountain Metro roughly $47,000, McCann said. Vanpool fees paid for about 20 percent, and state funds generated through registration fees and fines under the state’s FASTER program covered the rest of the cost, she said.

China’s biggest online to offline (O2O) service provider, Meituan-Dianping, is tapping into the ride-hailing sector. It has attracted 200,000 users in Beijing for its new ride-hailing service, which is yet to be opened. Apart from Beijing, Meituan-Dianping started to register users in other cities including Shanghai, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Fuzhou and Xiamen. Its nationwide expansion indicates that it will take on prominent market leader, Didi Chuxing, China’s largest ride-hailing app operator with estimated 450 million users.
Heavy subsidies to attract drivers and passengers
Bonuses for users matter a lot, which was once a key strategy to Didi Chuxing’s success. To attract drivers to sign up to its platform, Meituan-Dianping launched a policy declaring that the first 50,000 drivers to sign up will be exempt from a commission cut, while its competitor Didi Chuxing takes a 20% cut from drivers. Drivers complain that the commission fee charged by Didi Chuxing is very high, therefore a new ride-hailing platform is welcomed by drivers.
Before the recruitment of users, Meituan-Dianping had begun to test the service in Nanjing 10 months ago. Its daily orders have exceeded 100,000 and the operation team has reached 200 people. Passengers in Nanjing are willing to use Meituan-Dianping due to its continuous vouchers for users. It is estimated that the subsidy for each order is equal to RMB 20 (USD 3.11) and costs USD 310,000 in total every day.
Meituan-Dianping’s strategy of subsidising reminds us of Uber’s entry into China. Uber entered China in August, 2014 and invested subsidies of USD 2 billion in China, however this caused deception in relation to subsidies among drivers. Uber China merged with Didi Chuxing in August 2016.
Will Meituan-Dianping follow a similar path to Uber China? Chen Shaoli, Meituan-Dianping’s Senior Vice-President of corporate development, claimed that Meituan-Dianping will not rely much on user subsidies and therefore will not go down Uber’s path.
Ride-hailing is part of O2O service loop
What made Meituan-Dianping enter the ride-sharing sector? Wang Xing, founder and CEO of Meituan-Dianping, claimed that Meituan-Dianping would like to do business relating to O2O which stands for ‘offline to online’ and ride-hailing services. According to an internal email at the end of last year, Wang said that the company would upgrade its platform in four aspects: when users are in a store, at home, in a car, or travelling.
Wang Xing, founder and CEO of Meituan-Dianping. Photo from ifeng.com
As a pioneer of O2O, Meituan-Dianping provides various services including food delivery and hotel bookings. The great number of users and their demands for transportation services give Meituan-Dianping an opportunity to enter the ride-hailing arena.
A manager working for Meituan Dache, its riding-sharing branch, told ThePaper.cn that 30% out of 250 million active users have been demanding transport services. The entry into the riding-sharing sector will help Meituan-Dianping to improve its service functions and to be an integrated platform.
Apart from users’ needs, another underlying cause that drove Meituan-Dianping to enter the new sector is that ride-hailing services will help to increase Meituan-Dianping’s valuation. At present, Meituan-Dianping has become the world’s fourth-most valuable startup, reaching a USD 30 billion valuation. However, the valuation for Meituan-Dianping doesn’t satisfy its CEO, Wang’s, estimate of USD 100 billion. The new business of ride-sharing services offers a big piece of the pie, and its valuation may exceed the entire scale of Meituan-Dianping’s other businesses including food delivery, hotel bookings, travelling, movies and so on. Therefore, the entry to the ride-sharing business will help to improve Meituan-Dianping’s valuation significantly.
Blurred boundaries
The boundaries between different industries has been blurring. While Meituan-Dianping planned to enter Didi Chuxing’s ride-hailing market, Didi Chuxing invested in Ele.me, a leading food delivery startup in China, to do food delivery. This is not a new business model. The combination of food delivery and ride-hailing has been done successfully by Uber Eats.
That Meituan-Dianping and Didi Chuxing enter their main competitors’ market is not by accident. Apart from the dominance of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent which are called ‘BAT’, Toutiao, Meituan-Dianping and ride-sharing giant, Didi Chuxing, have been known as ‘TMD’. Obviously, Meituan-Dianping and Didi Chuxing see each other as the most important competitor.
Will Meituan-Dianping succeed? In fact, Meituan-Dianping did not launch its platform in Beijing by Jan 12 as it had planned, because it was assumed that Meituan-Dianping hadn’t received legal qualification from the administration. However, in the area of ride-hailing, Meituan-Dianping still has opportunities to achieve its market share through its efforts.
Firstly, the ride-sharing market is so huge that one giant, Didi Chuxing, cannot satisfy all the market needs. The rapid growth of users registration on Meituan Dache demonstrates this.
Secondly, Meituan-Dianping has a large user base and its integrated platform to provide various types of services is easy to use for users. Statistics show that the overlap ratio of drivers using Didi Chuxing and Meituan Dache is 19.46% in Nanjing, which means 19.46% Didi Chuxing Users use Meituan Dache at the same time.
On the other hand, the challenge that Meituan-Dianping needs to face is the stable dominance of Didi Chuxing in this market, in which bike-sharing startups have grabbed part of the market share. In fact, the era of rapid growth of the ride-hailing sector has passed. In addition, Didi Chuxing’s technological advancement cannot be ignored. Didi Chuxing has been well-known for its technological advancement which includes transportation predictions, big data and so on. That’s what Meituan-Dianping’s coupons cannot resolve in the short term.

The advent and success of app-based transportation alternatives to CNG auto-rickshaws and taxis in Dhaka have sent the latter groups in frenzy. Ride-sharing apps like Pathao and Uber have proven to be cheaper, user-friendly, and above all, convenient, unlike CNGs and taxis which rarely charge according to the meter or seldom agree to take a passenger on a ride.
Uber has already faced stiff criticism and outright protest in many countries from taxi drivers who claim the ride-sharing app is not a platform connecting rider and driver, but a global taxi company instead. But Uber owns no vehicles or employs drivers; the company argues all drivers have their own cars, self-employed, and work with Uber on a contractual basis.
CNG auto-rickshaws and taxis are commercial entities, and are thus subject to commercial tax. On the other hand, the vehicles enlisted on ride-sharing apps are personal vehicles and thus protected from commercial regulations.
Immediately after Uber’s launch a year ago, the Roads, Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader praised the initiative. But the next day, the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) said it did not have any permits to operate. A series of dramatic twists and turns followed where the government on one hand praised the tech-based initiative – which is in tune with the vision of Digital Bangladesh – and on the other hand call it illegal because of the lack of government approval.
But are ride-sharing platforms illegal?
Herein lies the catch, Uber, Pathao, etc are a modern-day innovation born out of ingenuity to combat the existing difficulty of commuting in urban areas. The concept of a platform which helps a private car owner connect to a commuter and establish a working relationship was not conceivable when the BRTA drafted the road transports guideline. It only extended to private vehicles and commercial vehicles. A platform which facilitated usage of private vehicles for commercial purposes was beyond anyone’s imagination.
Uber and Pathao skirt the guidelines. They have been developed outside the existing parameters, not in violation of it. This has prompted BRTA to call Uber and Pathao illegal, but after the overwhelming response to the ride-sharing apps and much discussion, met with the representatives to discuss a guideline to take into account the concept of ride-sharing.
To sum up, ride-sharing apps are perfectly legal, but use of personal vehicles for commercial use? Not so much. But things are changing with the government drafting new guidelines to adapt to the current setting.
Diversification & expansion
Uber appeared as a car-sharing service and Pathao provided motorcycles. Recently Uber has introduced UberMoto – motorcycle-based ride-sharing – and Pathao has introduced Pathao Cars.
Bahon, Ezzyr, Amarbike, Chalo, SAM – Share A Motorcycle, all offer a diverse array of services to commuters. Greater competition leads to greater innovation, lower prices, and all-around benefits for commuters and the industry.
The CNG auto-rickshaws and taxis have enjoyed a monopoly for years. The rapid popularity of ride-sharing apps has effectively thrown the outdated industry off-balance. In response, CNG auto-rickshaw and taxi drivers and owners have taken to calling the ride-sharing apps “unfair competition.”
Unfair competition or opportunity?
Hazrat Ali is a 45-year-old CNG auto-rickshaw driver. He claimed ride-sharing is cheaper because of the absence of commercial tax. He claimed the high commercial taxes on his vehicle and others have made operations costly.
But taxes are not the only concern for CNG auto-rickshaw drivers. They have a daily amount to pay to the owner which has to be met no matter what. The amount, despite being determined by the government, is often doubled or tripled, forcing CNG auto-rickshaws to charge the exorbitant fares.
Dhaka Metropolitan CNG Owners Association President Barkatullah Bulu said they also want to be a part of mobile application-based services. He said CNG auto-rickshaw owners are waiting to analyze the new policy on ride-sharing which is yet to be announced.
Bulu imagines the apps will allow CNGs to be tracked easily, which will also cut down the risk of hijacking on the vehicle. He hinted at the app offering insurance as well as several other security features.
The CNG Drivers Union, on the other hand, say they find it irrational that they were not included in ride-sharing platforms like Uber.
Dhaka District CNG Auto-rickshaw Workers’ Oikkya Parishad Secretary General Shakhawat Hossain Dulal claimed ride-sharing apps are unfair because not everyone can use smart phones.
He said: “If CNG drivers were trained, they too could have taken part. Excluding them is a gross exploitation of their economic potential.”
Rafiqul Islam is an Uber driver living in Uttara. He returned from Kuwait earlier this year, and took up driving for Uber when he found no other suitable employment. He uses his car to provide rides to commuters in need, and only occasionally rejects rides if he is running low on fuel.
He calls Uber a blessing and is thankful for the opportunity.
The popularity of shared motorcycles is mostly due to their navigability in the gridlocked roads of Dhaka. With time being of the essence, motorcycles are the preferred mode of transport in a hurry. But when comfort is preferred, shared cars win out.

According to a report by Uber, a private car remains unutilized 96% of the time. On average, 1.14 people occupy a private car. The report claimed a shared car was able to displace 9-13 cars on a daily basis.
Furthermore, Uber claimed they received over 1.5 million requests from passengers in Dhaka over the past one year. And 200,000 of them were in November alone. The report also says around 9,500 drivers make daily trips in Dhaka, and around 100 new drivers sign up with Uber every day.
Adapt, evolve, overcome
In spite of its success and popularity, Uber did not disclose its earnings over the year. Arpit Mundra, general manager of Uber Kolkata and Uber Dhaka, said they are working with the government to sort out the legal issues.
Pathao responded to the Dhaka Tribune’s queries over an email, saying it is merely a platform that allows commuters to connect to riders. They denied being a service.
According to Pathao, around 1,000 people take Pathao Car rides on a daily basis, but did not disclose the daily Pathao bike ride tally. Pathao has around 50,000 users, according to Google Play Store.
Pathao authorities also said they are working with the government to bring their operations under a clearly defined legal framework.
SAM – Share A Motorcycle and Hello CNG are currently working to include CNG in their apps.
Imtiaz Kashem, founder of SAM and managing director of Datavoxcel Ltd, is the first to design the concept of sharing motorcycle rides in Bangladesh. He said that CNGs could have been integrated in their apps, but CNG owners were not available to layout the plans and discuss terms. He also said if need be, his company would train CNG drivers.
On the topic of unfair competition, he said there is a tax imposed on the vehicle and another on a person’s income and that is all there is to it.
Policymaking
Centre for Policy Dialogue Research Fellow Towfiqul Islam Khan said there are three aspects to consider the tax and unfair competition issues – registration, income tax and route fees.
Fakhrul Islam Patwary, a chartered accountant, said taxation depends on the purpose of the vehicle. If the vehicle is used for commercial purposes, the company has to pay income tax. But if a company shows there are lesser number of vehicles registered with them, it will be able to avoid paying taxes. He urged the government to ensure the companies were providing accurate numbers of their registered vehicles.
BRTA Chairman Md Moshiar Rahman said they are currently finalising the policy on a priority basis. He said all debates will be put to rest after the policy has been formulated.

Currently, ridesharing companies like Uber and Lyft operate in only 15 of the larger cities across the state —Auburn, Birmingham, Daphne, Gardendale, Gulf Shores, Homewood, Hoover, Huntsville, Mobile, Montgomery, Mountain Brook, Pelham, Tuscaloosa, Trussville and Vestavia Hills — but due to a lack of comprehensive, statewide regulations aren’t able to operate in all parts of the state.
Which is what Mountain Brooks-Republican State Rep. David Faulkner and Greensboro-Democratic State Sen. Bobby Singleton hope to remedy this legislative session. They’re soon introducing a bill that would create a ridesharing network across the state for companies like Uber and Lyft, and place it under the control of the Alabama Public Service Commission.
On Thursday, the pair was joined by Gov. Kay Ivey on the steps of the State House where they discussed plans for the bipartisan, statewide ridesharing legislation. They were also joined by the “Ride for Alabama” coalition, formed by supporters of the bill. More than 30 local rideshare drivers were also in attendance.

“To embrace the future, Alabama must accommodate modern transportation demands. The ability to request an on-demand ride is no longer considered a perk of being in a big city, it is an expectation no matter where one lives or work,” Ivey at the press conference. “Having consistent rules statewide for ridesharing is the sensible way to give Alabamians access to safe, consistent and efficient transportation options.”
Alabama is one of only six states that lacks statewide ridesharing regulations. If passed, the bill would allow Alabamians from not only the larger cities, but also suburban and rural communities across the state to take advantage of all benefits the ridesharing industry produces.
“Alabama has the opportunity to make the best decision for the state’s future with regard to a statewide ridesharing framework, as the passage of this bill would provide citizens from one corner to the other with the opportunity for safe and reliable transportation,” said Faulkner.
“Ridesharing creates transportation options for those with low incomes, the elderly, and people with disabilities,” added Singleton. “By increasing overall transportation access for all of Alabama, we are also creating new economic opportunities for our state.”

Ride for Alabama is made up of multiple Chambers of Commerce and third-party entities, such as Birmingham Urban League, Decatur-Morgan County Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives, the Alabama Black Chamber of Commerce, Young Alabama and the Alabama Association for the Deaf, Inc., among others.
“Embracing innovative and forward-thinking technology platforms like Lyft and Uber will continue to move Alabama forward,” said Deon Gordon, Ride for Alabama coalition member and president, TechBirmingham. “The time has come for Alabama to become the 45th state to expand these vital transportation options to all.”

SOUTHOLD, NY — With the North Fork continuing to emerge as a tourist destination, Southold Town is seeking alternatives to help solve traffic congestion issues and help visitors and residents traverse area roadways more easily. To that end, at Tuesday’s work session, the board discussed two proposals, one, for a ride sharing program (rideshare), and the second, for a Suffolk County regional bike sharing program (bikeshare). Paul Spreer, regional project manager of 511NY Rideshare, conducted a presentation on a ridesharing portal now available on the Southold Town website.
“Once you register you’ll have access to thousands of other users as well. From carpooling and vanpooling to transit and bicycling, no matter where you live, there are alternatives to driving alone. Ridesharing can be a convenient, money saving travel experience. Check out all that we have to offer — ridematching for carpools, resources and information for transit, park and ride, bicycling, walking, and other options,” the site reads.
Spreer, regional project manager of 511NY Rideshare, said the goal of the program, run in conjunction with the New York State Department of Education, is to work with municipalities to reduce single occupancy vehicles around Long Island, something that’s beneficial from an economic and environmental standpoint, with an eye toward improving air quality in the area.
The website, he said, serves as a central location to inform both residents and visitors about their transportation options in town. Those who log in can find quick ride matches to meet their needs, he said. “It’s kind of like a match.com for car poolers,” Spreer said.
Those who sign up can log on and find someone to ride with, making plans to meet and commute together. The MTA is looking for options for SUV lanes, with an eye toward getting more than two people into a car to head to the city or another destination, he said. Success has already been found with larger organizations including hospitals, he said. The entire program is free of charge, Spreer said. “We all live on Long Island and we all know how important having a car is,” Spreer said. “We’re not putting anyone’s feet to the fire,” but anything that can lessen traffic on the roads is a plus, he said. Those who sign up online can fill out a profile including their “likes” for a commute, including whether or not they like loud music or coffee on the drive. The website also features local bus routes. “It’s kind of a one stop shop for people to find out what they need,” he said.
The riideshare might be particularly useful for various North Fork events such as the Strawberry Festival or for visiting popular businesses such as the lavender farm, Spreer said.
He added that a trolley coming to the North Fork is important to embrace from a strategic standpoint. “Under the heading of Captain Obvious, for every full trolley, that takes potentially 40 cars off the road,” he said. And, he added, as of June 29, Suffolk County residents will be able to utilize Uber and Lyft, which can be used to transport individuals as a “last mile solution,” perhaps picking up groups at designated exits on the highway with large vehicles that can be shared by 6 to 8 passengers. Spreer said the town should speak to local merchants and Chambers of Commerce to share the information about the new service; ridesharing is only as strong as the data it offers on the website, he said. Already, the company is working with the Huntington and Patchogue Chambers, he said.
In addition to rideshare, Spreer said the company has been working with Patchogue Village on a parking shuttle program, bringing visitors and up to 500 employees on a busy night to the popular and bustling Main Street. Issues such as gas money and liability would be dealt with by the town, Spreer said. Southold Town Supervisor Scott Russell said a joint meeting with local Chambers of Commerce would be organized to see if they have “buy in” for their own sites.
Not only rideshare: Bike sharing options
Next, Nick Palumbo, executive director of sustainability for Suffolk County Community College, discussed a Suffolk County regional bike share program with the board. “Bike sharing is really growing worldwide,” he said, adding that there are more than 850 systems internationally, and that he’s been working on the idea of a regional bikeshare program across Long Island for six months. One of the reasons the idea has become more popular is because of smart phone technology, he said. Benefits include getting people out of their cars and more active, a boon for public health, stress reduction and weight loss. He said those who are worried about impacts on local bike shops needn’t be; those shops benefit from the program and have even become involved with regional bike sharing. So far, the only bikeshare program on Long Island is in Long Beach; there are others in Albany and Buffalo, Palumbo said. The cost of the system varies depending upon the size of the program, he said. The hope is that Suffolk County would serve as a lead agency, with an umbrella contract that would allow local municipalities to opt in, he said. The county will be issuing a request for proposals for a bikeshare company in the coming weeks, he said. “The region has not been bike friendly but we see that starting to change, and we think a regional bikesharing program would facilitate that change,” Palumbo said. For example, he said, a dedicated bike path has been installed on Route 347, and a new rails to river program just opened in Port Jefferson; a dedicated bike lane could be coming soon to Nichols Road, Palumbo said. The goal is a commuter connection, that would let people use trains and then bike the last mile to hamlet centers, public libraries and other locales. The bikes would also be a good idea in areas where tourism is seasonal, he said. Bikes could be sited at existing bike trails, beaches, schools, health care facilities and train stations, Palumbo said. At Suffolk County Community College’s three campuses, of the 28,000 students, approximately 6,000 don’t have vehicles and rely on other forms of transportation; bikesharing allows them the possibility to rely upon public transportation and not have to own a car, Palumbo said. “We see the county’s role as being important in this effort,” Palumbo said. He added that Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone has shown support for the initiative. The idea could work in Nassau County, too, he said. Palumbo said he’s also presented the plan to the Riverhead and Southampton town boards, as well as various villages, and will soon speak to East Hampton.
Costs of bikesharing
Startup capital for the program is estimated at a cost of $1,600 per bike, which includes technology built in to the bikes, and collection points where bikes will be collected estimated to cost another $450. Funding sources include sponsorships, rider use fees and memberships, and grants, Palumbo said. In Portland, Nike sponsors a successful bike sharing program, he said. Local sponsors could also be sought in Southold, he said. “We think the time is right for Long Island to get on board with this,” Palumbo said. Russell asked about the specifics of the program, such as where sites would be located. Palumbo said a contract would be awarded by the county and towns would have the ability to opt in; town officials would work with vendors in the planning effort to identify locations that would be suitable for bikesharing. It’s up to the vendor to rebalance the system, bringing bikes to a docking site that has none; incentives could be provided to encourage individuals to retrieve a bike and bring it back to the train station, for example, Palumbo said. Councilman Jim Dinizio said most of the town’s train stations are not located near main hamlet hubs and said many roads are not wide enough for bike lanes; he asked how the program would work in that situation. While Long Island doesn’t have many biking trails to date, Palumbo said the new program could create change. “We see this as an opportunity to address that. When you provide bikes, you provide the rationale for creating biking infrastructure. It’s not chicken and egg. We want to do both things simultaneously. Hopefully, having a system across Long Island will make it more viable,” he said.

Ridesharing has the potential to bring a wealth of benefits both to the actors directly involved in the shared trip (e.g., shared travel costs or access to high-occupancy vehicle facilities) and also to the society in general (e.g., reduced traffic congestion and CO2 emissions). However, even though ridesharing is based on a win-win collaboration and modern mobile communication technologies have significantly eased discovering and managing ride matches, the adoption of ridesharing has paradoxically decreased during the last years. In this respect, recent studies have highlighted how privacy concerns and the lack of trust among peers are crucial issues that hamper the success of ridesharing. In this chapter, the authors, Sánchez, Martinez and Domingo-Ferrer, from the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, tackle both of these issues by means of (i) a fully decentralized P2P ridesharing management network that avoids centralized ride-matching agencies (and hence private data compilation by such agencies); and (ii) an also decentralized reputation management protocol that brings trust among peers, even when they have not previously interacted. 
Their proposal rests on co-utility, which ensures that rational (even purely selfish) peers will find no incentives to deviate from the prescribed protocols. They have tested their system by using data gathered from real mobility traces of cabs in the San Francisco Bay area, and according to several metrics that quantify the degree of adoption of ridesharing and the ensuing individual and societal benefits.

Even under a shared mobility paradigm, over 46,000,000 vehicles (two, three, and four wheelers) could be sold by 2030, it said.
“This annual market size would present an opportunity for Indian companies to become leaders in EV (electric vehicle) technology on a global scale,” it added.
The report said overcoming key barriers to vehicle electrification in the country’s passenger mobility sector presents an enormous challenge for India and also a tremendous economic opportunity.
“India can leapfrog the western mobility paradigm of private-vehicle ownership and create a shared, electric and connected mobility system, saving 876 million metric tons of oil equivalent, worth $330 billion and 1 giga-tonne of carbon-dioxide emissions by 2030,” it said.
It added that the main barriers to EV adoption include price, charging and consumer awareness.
EV charging infrastructure, battery swapping and manufacturing are some of the areas which can help overcome these barriers, the report said.

Ridesharing with social contacts (i.e., ‘friends’) is substantially more accepted than with strangers. However, limiting ridesharing to friends while rejecting strangers also reduces ride choices and increases detour costs. This work studies, from a theoretical perspective, whether the additional detour costs of limiting shared rides to social network contacts would be prohibitive. It proposes a social network based ridesharing algorithm with heterogeneous detour tolerances for varied social contacts. The theoretical matching rates and detour costs are compared in a simulation for three levels of social connectivity: travelling with direct contacts only, with direct and indirect contacts, or with anyone. The simulation allows for a systematic and comprehensive testing of system behaviour when varying the parameters of social network structure, detour tolerance, and spatial distribution of friendship. Results show that for a clustered friendship – the expected spatial distribution of a social network growing with a ride-sharing network – ridesharing with friends does not cause significantly higher costs. Furthermore, the algorithm prioritising friends can substantially increase the matching of friends. An empirical study justifies the findings.
1. Introduction
The growing amount of cars on the road results in increasing congestion of urban traffic, which then leads to higher fuel consumption, longer average travel time, more environmental pollution, and less patience of people with their daily travel (International Transport Forum, 2013). One known way to reduce the traffic load on the road without harming accessibility is looking for higher occupancy rates per vehicle, i.e., through ridesharing. Trajectory analysis has indicated good chances of ridesharing according to space-time concurrence (Santi et al., 2014). But despite the environmental and economic benefits, there is still a low rate in participation of ridesharing (Amey, 2010; Chaube, Kavanaugh, & Pérez-Quiñones, 2010; Wessels, 2009). The contradiction is partially due to the strong reluctance to share rides with strangers according to some surveys (Chaube et al., 2010; Wessels, 2009). The low willingness for ridesharing with strangers signifies that many of the existing ride opportunities, according to trajectory overlap, are actually inacceptable for a certain person. The preference for travelling with social contacts (a first or second degree socially connected person, hereafter called “friend”) seems to be a good reason to limit ridesharing to friends. Realising this argument, Facebook filed recently a patent called “Event-based ride-sharing” (Richardson, Petrescu, & Finch, 2016), which allows drivers to select users based on his/her social network connections for an online negotiation on carpooling to an event.
However, a ridesharing system limited to friends has yet to address the impact of missing chances of getting a ride. Ridesharing exclusively with friends while declining offers from strangers may lead to fewer opportunities to get a ride within a given space-time budget and to higher detour costs. This study aims to examine the theoretical costs and benefits of ridesharing with friends by systematic and comprehensive variation of parameters in a simulation beyond a particular context. Empirical tests are run as validations. As social networks are gaining attention in travel behaviour research (Arentze & Timmermans, 2008; Hackney & Marchal, 2011), this work helps gain insightful understanding into how spatial structures of social networks affect ridesharing results.

SEOUL (Reuters)  Hyundai Motor said on Thursday it had invested in Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab, as it seeks to expand into the region to reduce its reliance on China following a damaging diplomatic row between Seoul and Beijing.
Hyundai’s first direct investment in a ride-hailing firm gives it a “foothold” in the world’s third-biggest ride-hailing market after China and the United States, it said.
Singapore-based Grab, the biggest operator in the region’s third-party taxi hailing and private-vehicle hailing sector, has expanded to eight Southeast Asian countries.
“The deal should help raise the exposure of Hyundai Motor in the region, while responding to the future mobility market,” said Lee Sang-hyun, an analyst at IBK Securities.
Hyundai’s interest in Southeast Asia has grown since South Korean companies were targeted last year in a Chinese backlash over Seoul’s decision to deploy a U.S. missile defence system against Beijing’s objections.

The region of about 500 million people is dominated by Japanese carmakers, while Hyundai has focused on China and the United States.
CATCH-UP
Hyundai is also looking to catch up with its peers in future mobility, the personal transport innovations from ride-sharing to self-driving cars that are expected to reshape the auto industry.
While it does offer car-sharing services in the United States and Europe, until now it has watched from the sidelines as competitors like GM and Toyota have allied with ride-sharing partners.
Hyundai and Grab said they would jointly develop services in Southeast Asia, including one utilising Hyundai’s eco-friendly models such as the IONIQ Electric.
They did not disclose the value of Hyundai’s investment.

When Zach Rogers went on his lunch break one day last week, instead of unwinding for a few minutes, he hit the streets of Palmyra looking for people needing a ride.
Rogers is one of the first Uber drivers registered in Northern Missouri, the last geographical market of the state for the app-based ride-sharing company to penetrate.
Uber and other ride-sharing companies — notably Lyft — have challenged traditional taxicab companies for viability in the transportation industry increasingly in recent years. Uber drivers utilize their own vehicles, set their own work schedule, and can drive anywhere in their designated area.
With his registration in northern Missouri, Rogers can drive people anywhere in the state of Missouri, including on long-distance trips from Hannibal to St. Louis, Kansas City, or even Branson, Mo. — five hours away.
The business is entirely app-based, with potential riders identifying their destination through the app and the nearest Uber driver summoned to take them there.
Riders create an account and enter payment information. Payment is automatic with the information on file once the ride concludes.
Rogers originally applied to be a driver in Columbia, Mo., but once Uber opened driving to the northern third of the state, he applied to drive based out of Hannibal.
“I downloaded the Uber Driver app, and most of the application process took place there. They ask (optionally) for references for your driving.
After the first part is done, they need your drivers license, insurance information, as well as vehicle registration,” Rogers said. “After confirming the vehicle is able to drive for Uber, they have to put you through a background check.
This took about two weeks to conclude, as they are pretty thorough with the process.”
Uber is fairly new in much of Missouri, with questions regarding ride-sharing regulations were resolved when Gov. Eric Greitens signed House Bill 13 into law in April allowing the businesses to operate in the Show-Me without regulations.
However, the bill requires app-based companies to conduct driver background checks and pay a licensing fee. Uber does not pay local taxes and does not have a business license on file, according to Hannibal city clerk Angel Zerbonia.
While ride-sharing service thrive in cities with a high population density, will it succeed in more rural markets?
Rogers thinks it has a chance.
“Most people do not even realize it is available here yet,” he said. “My wife and I have posted in a Facebook group three or four times advertising the arrival of Uber in the area, and each time there are a large amount of people who are just then finding out about it.”
With more exposure, he predicts business will pick up.
“I think it can be especially useful in our downtown area near the bars,” he said. “Maybe out at the (Mark Twain) casino (in La Grange) could be a good place as well.
It’s just a matter of getting everyone to know it’s out there. I try to stay active until after 2 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, and I see all kinds of taxis driving people around.”

Riders are able to rate their drivers using the app, so a potential rider can know a little bit more about the driver.
“I have had some people use the service though, and I think it went very well. With Uber you often get a level a interaction and fun you wouldn’t get with a taxi driver,” he said.
Without having to abide by a taxicab company’s policies, Rogers can do things like allow the rider to control the music. He also has snacks in his car available for riders.
According to its website, Lyft also operates in Northern Missouri through its Columbia, Mo., market.

Increasing Ridesharing (Abstract)
One of the main obstacles that has challenged peer-to-peer (P2P) ridesharing systems in operating as stand-alone systems is reaching a critical mass of participants. Toward this goal, we propose what we call the P2P ride exchange mechanism to increase matching rate and customer retention in a ridesharing system. This mechanism gives riders the opportunity to purchase other riders’ itineraries while it provides suitable alternative rides to the sellers, thus increasing the service rate in a ridesharing system. The proposed mechanism aims to maximize expected user surplus, is robust towards selfish user manipulation, and has very low information requirements. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate what type of ridesharing systems can benefit the most from P2P ride exchange. Furthermore, we study the impact of customer flexibility on the rate of exchange. If implemented properly, P2P ride exchange can effectively increase the number of served riders and enhance customer loyalty by engaging customers in the ride-matching process.


1. Introduction
Peer-to-peer (P2P) dynamic ridesharing is a shared mobility alternative in which peer drivers and riders (passengers) share the space in the drivers’ personal vehicles. The term “P2P” implies that drivers are not hired by companies to transport passengers, but are rather using their personal vehicles to carry out their personal tasks, which makes them peers to riders. The term ’dynamic’ highlights the fact that customers can join the system at any point in time and do not have to book their trips in advance.
P2P ridesharing manages to eliminate vehicles from roads by getting people who are traveling in the same direction in the same vehicle. P2P ridesharing benefits drivers, riders, non-users, the transportation infrastructure, and the environment. Drivers receive monetary compensation for the service they provide while following their own daily schedules, and riders are charged less than other transportation alternatives, such as taxis. By reducing the number of traveling vehicles and hence congestion levels, the benefits of P2P ridesharing are extended to the entire community as well as the environment.
Contrary to traditional service businesses where servers belong to the business and their number is proportional to the demand for service, in P2P ridesharing servers are also customers. Therefore, it is important for the system operator to attract the right proportion of riders and drivers. Another feature of P2P ridesharing systems is that drivers typically have specific locations where they start and end their trips, and tight travel time windows to carry out their trips. This limits the level of spatiotemporal coverage of the network by each driver. Therefore, in order to serve a higher number of riders, a ridesharing system needs to increase the spatiotemporal coverage of the network by increasing the number of drivers. To motivate, attract and retain a high number of drivers, a high number of riders is necessary. Therefore, the number of customers in a P2P ridesharing system should pass a certain critical mass with a specific proportion of drivers to riders, in order for the system to be able to operate independently and without a need for outsourcing supply.
A ride-matching algorithm is the engine of a P2P ridesharing system, determining how drivers and riders should be paired. Except for very simple and non-efficient ridesharing systems (which we will discuss later), the ride-matching problems are computationally hard to solve. A good ride-matching method is one that can provide the highest number of matches in an attempt to engage the highest number of customers and bypass the critical mass of participants.
Customer experience is another factor that plays a role in the success of a P2P ridesharing system, especially during the initial phases of implementing the system. A customer (rider or driver) may give the system a chance by attempting to use the system a few times, but if he/she is not matched, there is a possibility that such a customer would never return to the system. Therefore, it is essential for a P2P ridesharing system to involve and retain as many customers as possible.
Customers in many transportation systems are served on a first-come, first-served (FCFS) or a similarly pre-ordered basis. For P2P ridesharing, in which customer retention is especially important, considering riders on an FCFS basis is an inefficient use of the very limited available resources (drivers). The FCFS rule, however, is the natural order of serving riders in a dynamic system, where riders announce their trips not long before departure. In addition, dropping the FCFS principle may lead to high solution times for the resulting matching problem, and is therefore not an appropriate implementation strategy for a dynamic real-time system.
In this paper, we introduce what we call P2P ride exchange, a mechanism to improve the number of matches in an FCFS-based system. In a system where P2P ride exchange is implemented, riders will still be considered for service on an FCFS basis. Upon joining the system, a rider will be offered the best available itinerary, according to certain criteria which we will discuss later. However, if no match exists, the rider will be given the chance to buy a previously-matched rider’s itinerary under specific circumstances. Purchasing an itinerary from a previously-matched rider is in fact reversing the FCFS rule. This exchange of rides is accompanied with an exchange of money through the system. Since the objective of the system from implementing the exchange mechanism is to increase the total number of matched riders, only riders for whom an alternative itinerary is available will receive a proposal to sell their current itineraries.
There are, admittedly, considerable regulatory obstacles to overcome for such P2P exchange or trade schemes to be used in transportation systems. The legal battles faced by ridesourcing firms are now well-known. Transportation supply being considered a public good, any breaking of the traditional FCFS operational paradigms also could face objections based on socio-political arguments of inequity across users. While important, such topics are considered beyond the scope of this paper that focuses only on showing the performance potential of the proposed scheme.

FLORENCE, SC (WBTW) – People in Florence can now use the ride-share app ‘Uber’.
The Greater Florence Chamber of Commerce says it’s worked to bring Uber to Florence for about a year and a half.
Chamber officials tell News13 Uber drivers will start off picking up people in the City of Florence.
President Michael Miller predicts as more drivers sign on, Uber may branch out to other cities like Darlington or Hartsville.
Miller says businesses and restaurants in the area requested the credit card driven app.
“We’ve been underserved for many years. We’re catching up fast and actually surpassing some of the other communities in South Carolina,” said Miller. “Different people use transportation for different things [and] different types of transportation. Taxis have their market. Uber just gives a different dimension to the ride- share type of program.”
For the last four years, Craig Anderson has been a driver for ‘Best Way Taxi’.
“Sometimes you might get a good day. Sometimes you might get a bad day,” said Anderson.
He does not think Uber will impact his business.
“The bigger cities… that is where I think Uber will work,” said Anderson.

He feels Uber drivers should have similar requirements and fees.
“You have to have a business license. You have to have the ORF sticker. All these fees to run the taxi’s and you have to do that every year,” said Anderson.
Anderson believes taxi services are a staple in the community.
“We’re going to stand our ground and keep… continue doing what we’re doing,” said Anderson. “We’re trying to expand our business up and here comes another cap company coming to Florence. I don’t think that’s right. If they can come here. Have them pay the same fees that we pay.”

Shared-use Mobility: today, we start we a new series of article on shared-use mobility. In the following articles, we will analyze each of the transportation services that are shared among users. Today, we analyze the meaning of shared-use mobility, the present situation and some speculations about future technologies.
Shared-use mobility is a term used to describe transportation services that are shared among users, including public transit; taxis and limos; bikesharing; carsharing (round-trip, one-way, and personal vehicle sharing); ridesharing (car-pooling, van-pooling); ridesourcing/ride-splitting; scooter sharing; shuttle services; neighborhood jitneys; and commercial delivery vehicles providing flexible goods movement.
Shared-use mobility sits within the broader phenomenon that has been termed the ‘Sharing Economy’, in which widespread usage of emerging information and communications technology (ICT), particularly smartphones, enables new forms of market interactions that can enable both new services and improved efficiency in asset utilization. Rather than individual physical items being purchased, owned, controlled, maintained and used solely by their owner, in shared-mobility systems the physical assets (bicycles, automobiles, small aircraft, etc.) are accessed sequentially by multiple users on a pay-per-use basis. This implies higher utilization rates of assets with relatively high fixed costs; in the case of automobiles the classical high fixed cost/low marginal cost paradigm of private car ownership is reversed.
Whereas shared-mobility was a niche market a decade ago, today the phenomenon has entered the mainstream, with a broad array of major automakers investing in shared-mobility services.
In fact, the UN reported in 2015 (UN World Population prospects) that migration patterns and population growth have created an equal split between inhabitants of cities and rural areas for the first time in human history. 
This general trend will continue for the next several decades and will produce a very urbanized world. The continued use of personal transportation model is simply unsustainable given the combination of energy inefficiency, environmental consequences of fossil-fuel usage, potential disruptions to fuel supplies, urban sprawl created by automobile reliance, and congestion caused by inadequate alternative modes of transport. What people need is to radically rethink the problem by examining not only the automobile itself, but also how it is used in cities (where most are currently living), including: 1. size and weight, 2. range and speed, 3. gasoline versus electric, 4. driver-controlled versus autonomous driving, and 5. private versus shared ownership.
Shared-use mobility services are probably the best solution to alleviate the problem. In fact, shared-use mobility services can: reduce traffic congestion, mitigate various forms of pollution, reduce fossil fuel consumption, and improve efficiency of transportation means. This is the reason why technology is advancing quickly and will advance more and more in the future.
Many shared-use vehicles service providers today include some degree of advanced technologies (online reservations, vehicle tracking, smart card access) in their operations. Currently, there is a developing need for interoperability among shared-use vehicle service providers (e.g., smart card access among carsharing organizations) and transit operators (e.g., transit fare collection via smart cards). Interoperability will likely result in higher customer satisfaction and use, leading to greater market penetration. Similarly, some standardization will likely unfold for overall operational techniques (online reservations and insurance policies), customer interactions, and to some degree vehicle interfaces. Because shared-use vehicle systems are still a relatively new mobility concept, an industrywide standardization approach is still premature. Nevertheless, there are attempts to identify many of the important issues that will play a significant role in the interoperability discussions among shared-use vehicle providers and the development of industry standards in the future. There are key elements in intelligent shared-use vehicle system operations and trade-offs encountered during the pioneering stage of shared-use vehicle system developments.

As Alaska’s legislative session ends, some perplexing in-house political gamesmanship has kept a popular bipartisan measure from making it to the House floor. It’s a shame, because freedom-loving Alaska now remains one of just a handful of states that still doesn’t allow ridesharing services such as Uber and Lyft to operate within its boundaries.
Senate Bill 14 has passed the full House and needs only a vote of the Senate to move it along to the governor’s office. But according to news reports, the House has bottled up the legislation in the Rules Committee, which rarely meets. The measure reportedly is being used as leverage by legislators fighting a contentious budget battle.
The Alaska Journal of Commerce reports that, instead of letting S.B. 14 get to the House floor and then presumably to the governor for his signature, “the House is effectively starting the legislative process anew by advancing its own version of Uber legislation.”
That’s bad for Alaskans, given the obvious benefits of allowing these services to operate. The bill wisely clarifies that these drivers are independent contractors, thus restricting various efforts to mandate the payment of myriad employee benefits and thereby keeping this a cost-effective option. It also would prevent Alaska cities from imposing their own onerous local restrictions on these services. The bill requires background checks for these TNC drivers, but it’s still overall a good step forward that’s backed by ridesharing companies.
Although Alaska political observers expect that a ridesharing bill will eventually get to the floor at some point this year or next, it’s mistake to delay the ability of these companies to offer not only jobs, but rides to people who need a convenient – or safe – way to get home.
The Economist recently reported on a new study suggesting that “the arrival of Uber to New York City may have helped reduce alcohol-related traffic accidents by 25-35 percent.” According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, Alaska has one of the nation’s highest rates of excessive drinking. Uber and Lyft aren’t a panacea for such a significant social problem, but they could make the streets of Anchorage, Juneau and Fairbanks a bit safer.
With a week to go before the session’s end and a budget crisis looming, legislators might have other things on their mind. But the budget problem will eventually get fixed. Alaska residents who want to use ridesharing services shouldn’t be held hostage to that process.

Abstract
The increasing number of vehicles and drivers have led to a marked increase in travel time expenditure (TTE), congestion, demand for fossil fuels, and adverse environmental impacts. Improving energy efficiency in the transportation sector, public awareness of the behavior of the people vis-à-vis energy efficiency, implementing policies that encourage other modes of transportation (e.g., public transit, ride-sharing, bicycles, and walking, etc.) that decrease vehicle dependency are some effective approaches that mitigate the aforementioned negative effects, which will lead to significant reductions in the total energy consumption. This article investigates the effect of governmental policies on vehicle dependency reduction and the decrease of Travel Time Expenditure by vehicle owners, and propose a novel method to calculate the current and future Travle Time Expendituress by individuals. The effect of demographic variables and the region on vehicle dependency and Travel Time expenditure for students of three of the most populated universities in Malaysia (University of Malaya, University Putra Malaysia, and University Technology Malaysia) were investigated as well. The peoples’ expectations from individual modes of transportation such as cycling and walking were also analyzed. The results showed that all demographic factors, except nationality, affect the levels of vehicle ownership, while income levels and nationality affects Travel Time Expenditure by personal vehicles. The results show that the average Travel Time Expenditure can be reduced by 89% if the recommended infrastructure (e.g., increase bus routes, train routes, train services, frequencies of buses and train, and facilities for cyclists, etc.) is provided. These outcomes can assist policy makers to efficiently manage transportation budgets, and would also help people decrease vehicle usage, which will subsequently decrease their corresponding Travel Time Expenditure and fuel consumption.

Sharing rides could drastically improve the efficiency of car and taxi transportation. Unleashing such potential, however, requires understanding how urban parameters affect the fraction of individual trips that can be shared, a quantity that they call shareability. Using data on millions of taxi trips in New York City, San Francisco, Singapore, and Vienna, the researchers compute the shareability curves for each city, and find that a natural rescaling collapses them onto a single, universal curve. They explain this scaling law theoretically with a simple model that predicts the potential for ride sharing in any city, using a few basic urban quantities and no adjustable parameters. Accurate extrapolations of this type will help planners, transportation companies, and society at large to shape a sustainable path for urban growth.

The emerging sharing economy promises to improve the efficiency of individual, on-demand transportation. Bridging the gap between shared but inflexible public transportation and flexible but not shared private transportation, novel services can significantly contribute to reducing road congestion and emissions. But the realizability of such potential benefits depends on the answer to a fundamental unsolved question: How compatible in space and time – and thus shareable – are individual mobility patterns?

It has long been agreed that a “sharing economy” will be a growing living model adopted in many sectors, and, in Italy, this model is indicative of a large-scale change in lifestyle. Growing numbers of Italians are rejecting the car ownership model and embracing car sharing instead, making the country the second largest users of car share schemes in Europe (after Germany), according to a recent study by Frost & Sullivan.
Mobility habits in Italy are changing rapidly. A change in attitude and the high population density in cities are the main reasons for this rapid growth in car sharing.
According to the Ministry of the Environment’s first report on sharing mobility in Italy, car sharing services are operational in 29 cities— a figure only set to increase as 43 Italian cities have more than 100,000 inhabitants, 10 of which exceed 300,000.
In these cities car-sharing is booming, with nearly 2,000 vehicles and 370,000 subscribers Milan alone and car sharing occurring 5,741 times every day in Rome (according to Urbi). These two Italian cities alone account for 2.1 million car-sharing trips per year.
The result is that it has become increasingly commonplace not to have a car: two out of ten car share scheme users have either said goodbye to their own vehicle or decided not to buy one.
This reduction in car ownership is the first sign of a significant ongoing transformation in Italian society, towards a growth model more in line with a service economy.
This shift towards a ‘sharing economy’ has gained momentum over the last few years as a young generation of ‘Millennials’ reject the obsession with car ownership that was dominant with their predecessors the ‘baby boomers’.

Car sharing is the first choice for a young generation, who grew up in an uneasy economy, are environmentally aware, exercise their eco-consciences and seek satisfaction from shared experience rather than the accumulation of stuff and debt.
According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), 57 percent of adults agree that access is the new ownership.
Consequently, the boom in the economy of sharing has arrived, not only in transport but also in housing, in designer clothing, food and do-it-yourself (DIY) equipment. If we consider that there will be 2.3 billion Millennials in 2020 (half of the global workforce) we can predict a considerable growth in this phenomenon looking forward. In part, the value chains have already been transformed.
“Platforms for the exchange of goods are probably what Italians are most familiar with; in fact, it is in this sector that some of the first sharing services were born in Italy,” said Marta Mainieri, founder of Collaboriamo.org and author of the annual mapping of the sharing economy in Italy.
During the last mapping, reported in 2016, Collaboriamo.org surveyed 138 sharing platforms on the Italian market (including 27 foreign platforms with offices in Italy), up by 17 percent compared with the previous year.
Besides transport, the area with the highest number of Italian sharing platforms (18) is in exchanging, renting and selling items.
The services that sell used items—such as Bakeka and Subito—are those best known to the general public. However, there are others, such as LocLoc or Useit, which rent out all types of goods, while Sharewood specializes in the sharing of sports equipment.
The largest growth sector, however, is corporate services, in which the platforms have doubled in a year, from 6 to 12; “demonstrating the fact that companies now understand the sharing economy,” said Mainieri.
Two organizations that are very active in this area are the Brodolini Foundation, which is involved in different projects to redefine relations between businesses starting out with circularity and sharing, and the Polytechnic University of Turin with the European project Retrace, which is aimed at smart, sustainable and inclusive design.
The most popular platforms range from those that share work instruments (Toolsharing) to those that offer shared spaces (Sharepro and Co-hive).
ShopShareing and Theshopshare enable retailers to share their shops with manufacturers, artisans, and businesses.
Meanwhile, this sharing logic is even finding followers among traditional companies: for example, DIY giant Leroy Merlin has set up a support network in Italy providing a “construction site exchange,” which comprises of both materials needed for work and the expertise of its staff.
Once the renovation is complete, the beneficiaries must in-turn get involved in a similar initiative in other housing or accommodation facilities, thus creating an ethical support circle.

The ebb and flow of a city may feel entirely unique, but it turns out there are universal laws that may govern the chaos of your commute.
A team from the Senseable City Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have created what they call a law of “shareability.” Using inputs like traffic speed and urban density, they think they can predict the potential for ride-sharing in any city.
And no, not Uber’s version of ride-sharing — basically a glorified taxi service — but actual car trips shared between strangers.
The leader of the lab, Carlo Ratti, said the research began when they examined how many trips could be shared in New York. In other words, how many rides from Harlem to Soho could take place in the same car without too much delay.
At the time, they found buddying up in this manner would reduce the number of taxis in New York by 40 percent.
Of course, this type of sharing is what services like UberPOOL aim to do, and the ride-hailing giant helped fund a follow-up study.
In Sydney to speak at the CityTalks Design panel series, Ratti said the team discovered “something like a universal law of shareability.” Analysing New York, San Francisco, Singapore and Vienna to create the formula, they published their findings in Nature in March. They then applied the formula to other cities.
The key parameters are speed of traffic (if cars can move fast, you can share more), the density of trips and the size of the city. “If the city is very spread out, if there is a lot of sprawl, then it is more difficult to share,” he explained.
This last factor may explain why Sydney and Melbourne rank so low on the “shareability” scale — last and second last, respectively. (New York and Barcelona tied for first.)
Sydney’s sprawling geography is a barrier, but also the fact there’s significant employment that’s generated outside the central business areas, prompting many disparate trips.

“That’s why it may be different from Europe or environments in America — we just don’t have that same density,” he explained. “There’s little chance for lots of trips to overlap.”
Ratti admitted taste and tradition mattered to shareability, but in his view, young people are increasingly open to the idea. The formula is useful to companies or governments looking to launch ride-sharing services or carpooling systems, he suggested.
