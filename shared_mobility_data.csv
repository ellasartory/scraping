The adoption of new-age technologies and systems that are more resilient to uncertainties can make a difference to automotive companies and industry as a whole.
By  Rupak Rathore 
The automobile sector has been adversely impacted by the sudden disruption caused by the pandemic and associated lockdown last year. It recorded a drop in sales across segments and manufacturing as well as supply chains broke down. However, the industry started showing early signs of recovery with an increase in month over month sales in the latter half of 2020.
While the second wave once again affected the automotive sector adversely, it has reaffirmed the need for the sector to focus on aggressive adoption of new-age technologies and create systems more resilient to uncertainties. The following are ways by which some of the 21st century’s emerging digital technologies can make a difference to automotive companies.
Robotic Process Automation (RPA):
Process automation using digital workers brings increased accuracy. Be it the regulatory compliance, interpretability of paper into the digitized medium, machine dismantling and assembling, or inventory management, RPA has come a long way to ensure near quasi perfect accuracy. These software robots are programmed with suitable algorithms to perform a particular task. Once the robots are well trained, these tasks are automated. These digital workers are getting increasingly sophisticated with a combination of Machine Learning and Image Processing algorithms.
Big Data:
Big Data in the automobile industry can help with customer retention through improved after-sales services. While the profit margins for the dealer vary with vehicle models, it is the after-sales services and periodic maintenance from which they earn a sizeable profit. The need of the hour is personalized services to forge great relationships with customers. Big Data helps to analyse the buyer’s likings and preferences for recommending a customized offering for a particular customer. Big Data can also predict probable wear and tear, after which a damaged part (of the vehicle) can cause an interruption in daily use or complete breakdown. It also alerts the driver by segmenting and analysing his driving patterns and habits that can cause an accident. Big Data can also be used for improving vehicle design, as it can give insights into how the vehicle/component performs in market conditions.
Cloud Computing:
Cloud computing can assist automotive companies by reducing the onsite IT hardware costs of an organisation, especially in terms of power consumption and hardware repair, depreciation and labour. Cloud computing can improve the efficiency of GPS and entertainment systems installed in the car. Cars can become smart and perceptive vehicles equipped to tackle varied road and traffic situations. However, such controls and continuous information feed requires perpetual and on-demand predisposition of systems that can only happen with the help of the cloud. Furthermore, data forms the core of numerous functions in the automobile industry, and it is directly proportional to the manufacturing of a vehicle model. The data from various departments need to be collaborated to produce the perfect model.
Predictive and Advanced Data Analytics:
Predictive and advanced data analytics can help in product quality management, product recall and improved customer satisfaction. Predictive analytics can help the quality management teams to process a large set of information (historical) that can reveal the underlying cause. It allows for the early detection of issues and minimises the probability of their occurrence in the future. Data can also facilitate in improving the safety of the vehicle – both during design and while being driven. Furthermore, it assures a better and more efficient recall process.
Artificial Intelligence:
AI is impacting the automobile industry in a big way. It can alert the drivers of a hazardous situation or component failure well before the scenario turns fatal. AI can also assist in the quality inspection that is a time-consuming process.
Integration of Telematics and Health:
As vehicles become more integrated with smartphones and wearables, avenues for improving emergency response – using a combination of telematics, vehicle sensors and wearables – emerge, which can save precious lives. Overall road safety can be improved by using Car2X frameworks for inter-vehicle communication.
Virtual Reality:
Virtual Reality is of great help to companies, dealers and customers alike. It helps automobile engineers to work together remotely (especially in the designing process). The design process on the physical mock-up requires massive resources and is time-consuming too. Furthermore, it reduces the need to create a prototype after every examination stage. The technology also helps the customers to get a feel of their new automobile without its physical body. Through virtual reality, they can get an immersive digital buying experience. A leading data and vehicle visualisation platform reported that as many as 76 lakh Indians chose to experience the features of their next car in 3D on the internet in 2020. VR has proven to be a boon for dealers during the prevalence of COVID-19, they have been able to continue with their business despite the logistic challenges and scarcity of resources. It is difficult for dealers to have a physical model of every specification as most of the manufacturers regularly launch restyled and remodelled versions. Customers always want to buy the most recent model. The use of VR can prove to be a better, immersive, and persuasive way to speed up their decision making. This is an ideal, win-win situation for both the customers and dealers.
Augmented Reality:
Augmented Reality provides a realistic feel for testing the critical functions and capabilities of a vehicle. The conventional method of testing requires extensive physical trials, which is expensive and cumbersome. With AR, engineers can build a prototype, have an easier time with critical logistics and technical checkpoints and can implement modifications in lesser time. Speedier production, more innovation and reduced cost would be possible with the integration of this technology.
While it is projected that the global automotive industry will grow to just under nine trillion U.S. dollars by 2030, an Invest India report suggests that the automobile industry may reach the 300 million dollar mark by 2026. However for the sector to script the kind of growth post-pandemic recovery, digital integration is a must.

 On-demand transit projects that started before COVID-19 have led to robust ridership and speak to innovation that the public will need in a post-COVID world, according to experts during an event last week. 
By Skip Descant


On-demand transit projects that started before COVID-19 have led to robust ridership and speak to innovation that the public will need in a post-COVID world, according to experts during an event last week.

“From the start of the pandemic, the public transportation industry pivoted to meet a new world of never-before-seen challenges,” said Paul Skoutelas, president and CEO of the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) during a July 28 press briefing. “Innovation became survival.”
APTA organized the briefing to underscore transit innovation during the pandemic and to present a new report titled “Mobility Innovation: The Case for Federal Investment and Support.”
The case studies in the report explore how various transit systems have structured, launched and pivoted on-demand projects. In most cases, the on-demand projects aim to bring transit opportunities to areas where few options exist. These areas are often suburban locations with low-density housing. But in some instances, bigger cities seek to improve their available transportation, as with a project in St. Petersburg, Fla., where the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA) partnered with transportation network companies (TNCs) and taxis to provide late-night transportation for service workers.
In many cases, the arrangements depend on partnerships with private mobility providers. When the pandemic reshuffled all forms of normal American life, transit started serving communities in often unorthodox ways. In Los Angeles, an on-demand program launched as a first-mile, last-mile solution through a partnership with Via. The program’s initial idea was to connect riders with transit stations. During the pandemic, the program, in addition to providing rides, morphed into a food delivery service for residents in need.
“When you have a partnership based on innovation, you can adjust that partnership to fit the needs of the moment,” said Joshua Schank, chief innovation officer for L.A. Metro, at the briefing. “And then it’s not a one-time thing. There are crises all the time. Different things come in and affect what you plan on doing. Being able to adjust is a lot easier when you’re working in an innovation culture and with an innovative team in the first place.”
The program with Via is now fully integrated within the L.A. Metro system as part of the Metro Micro program, an on-demand service Metro provides with its own operators.
“That means we now have a much larger pilot program for on-demand services,” said Schank.
The food delivery service has continued.
“People still need to get to essential food. And this could potentially be a mobility option that saves us trips by reducing the number of times people are going to and from places,” he added.
Before the pandemic, a similar on-demand program kicked off in Flint, Mich., and provided 13,000 rides a month. The program is now expected to provide some 20,000 to 25,000 rides a month, said Ed Benning, general manager and CEO of Mass Transportation Authority (MTA) Flint.
“So the need is very strong,” said Benning.
Another on-demand program in the Kansas City, Kan., area uses a seven-vehicle county-owned fleet. But the project also includes a partnership with a local taxi service, which can flex into the system and pick up some of the demand to cut down on wait times.
“In my mind that’s kind of the secret sauce that makes the microtransit program in Johnson County work,” said Josh Powers, business liaison for Johnson County, Kan.
Microtransit ridership is at 150 percent of pre-COVID levels, said Powers. The service provides more than 8,000 rides a month. Month by month, this number continues to increase.
Skoutelas remarked that transit is frequently seen as an “industry that’s slow to change.” However, this viewpoint overlooks the reality that a lot of change is happening in the transit world.
“[W]e need to bring attention to that,” he said. “And we want to share it as widely as we can.”

 Integrating on-demand microtransit options into existing services allows agencies to better serve communities with affordable, convenient public transit, promoting economic mobility. 
By Kellie Meilleur



Nearly 70 percent of all Americans who depend on the bus for their transportation needs make less than $50,000 per year. This, according to a report by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), validates that lower-income individuals rely more heavily on public transportation than those who are earn higher incomes. 
Across the nation, more and more transit agencies and cities are turning to on-demand microtransit service to expand and improve public transportation options for low-income residents. 
What exactly is microtransit? Simply, microtransit is dynamic routing. It takes mobile smartphone apps and puts them to use to create an efficient mode of transport that adapts with each passenger’s trip needs. At the click of a button, passengers can book a trip that will take them on the quickest route to their desired destination.  
A distinctive aspect of microtransit, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, is that it is “a privately owned and operated shared transportation system that can offer fixed routes and schedules, as well as flexible routes and on-demand scheduling. The vehicles generally include vans and buses.” 
Microtransit can be easily accessible and highly efficient anda ‘no-brainer’ for many lower income individuals who can’t afford to own a car and have therefore been greatly underserved by traditional transit networks.
When COVID-19 first hit, a majority of higher income earners began working from home and using their personal vehicles for necessary travel. On the far end of the spectrum, millions of lower-income Americans didn’t have the same luxury or opportunity. They needed to get to and from their jobs and other destinations, despite sweeping changes in how transportation options had changed and disadvantaged many since the pandemic.  
That’s where microtransit in its many forms came into play, and in a big way. 
Many transit agencies, anxious to serve their most underserved customers and plug the gap between traditional fixed-route transportation and more individual transportation options, are offering riders fast and convenient ways to book their trips.  
Microtransit has proven to be a mobility lifeline. Amid the many shutdowns we have all experienced, on-demand transit has pivoted to serve specific community needs, such as food delivery to our most vulnerable community members and transporting hospital and other frontline workers to their jobs, even in the overnight hours. In fact, APTA’s data shows that dynamic, on-demand public transit has proven to be a mobility lifeline for those in low-income areas during this crisis.
Transit industry expert, thought leader and influencer Paul Comfort recently hosted a podcast segment on his show, Comfort’s Corner, about the role of microtransit for equity and inclusion. As a thought leader in the public transportation space, Comfort sees public transportation’s role as one to improve equity and inclusion for those who need it most.First, it was for the elderly and those with mobility challenges, and now, it’s for those who are underserved.
Comfort believes that microtransit is the hottest trend to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. When the pandemic hit, transportation providers made major changes to their service based on changing ridership demand and to adhere to health and safety requirements. This included altering transit routes and changing the frequency of trips. These changes immediately impacted those who had no other means of getting from point A to point B. The silver lining is that microtransit has been the solution to the transit shortage problem. Comfort explains that “microtransit fills the transit gaps, and it ensures that no one gets left behind.”  
The great news is that the stop-gap solution that microtransit provides is here to stay. Significant data across several U.S. cities has recently been gathered suggesting that microtransit has been a vital public resource for lower-income individuals since the start of the pandemic. This information, along with insights shared by transit thought leaders like Comfort, help the transportation industry to look ahead to the long-term need for microtransit as part of the equity and inclusion solution. 
By joining the microtransit movement and integrating on-demand options into existing public transit infrastructure, transit providers across the country can better serve their communities with affordable, convenient public transportation and promote economic mobility for all.

An autonomous vehicle, also known as a driverless vehicle refers to a self-driving vehicle with an ability to sense. These vehicles use a fully automated driving system that is capable of responding to external conditions that a human driver can manage. Compared to manually-driven cars, autonomous vehicles have other advantages apart from being environmentally friendly. They reduce the risk of vehicle crashes as its software is designed to make fewer mistakes, reduce road congestion that comes with irresponsible driving, and allow people with disabilities to drive to places. It also reduces driver fatigue and makes overnight journeys easy.
With many tech giants such as Apple, Toyota, Google, and Tesla exploring this new technology, these are the trends that make anticipating the future exciting.
The First Level 5 Autonomous Car: The development of an autonomous car is divided into five stages and with the currency developments, manufacturers are hopeful for a level 5 car.

A Completely Unassisted Drive: Going on a road trip in a totally technology-run vehicle will soon be possible, thanks to automation.
Autonomous Trucking will become a Reality: Autonomous driving technology is set to transform the logistics industry as well with self-driving trucks.
Autonomous Ride-Sharing: The future doesn’t just involve owning a self-driving car, but also using autonomous car fleets for ride-sharing, reducing the dependency on fuel, and being good for the planet.
Diverse autonomous features: It’s not just the navigation that autonomous technology will boost, other automatic features like in-car virtual assistants and AR features will be an add-on.

Bringing
 items to the end consumer is as old as civilization, but many delivery 
firms and retail partners are in search of a profitable model
By Brian Straight

Many
 assume that last-mile delivery arose alongside the rapid growth of 
e-commerce. That narrative is simply false. Household moving companies 
have long considered themselves the final mile of delivery. Before them,
 there was the milkman, common in the early 1900s, who brought fresh 
dairy products to consumer doorsteps.
Lyft, Uber, et al seemed to 
change the game, though, but even their independent contractor-based 
businesses are not unique. During the Roman Empire, items reached eager 
citizens through cursus publicus
 (Latin for “the public way”). The system was a state-run courier and 
transportation system that utilized everyday citizens called mancipes, 
aka contractors, to transport food, animals and equipment.
The 
last mile is not new, but it is behaving very much like a startup 
company, seeing rapid growth in the last few years and now, perhaps, 
transitioning into its next phase — sustainability.
Last mile looks for balance
“The market will find a more natural equilibrium,” Guy Bloch, CEO of delivery technology firm Bringg,
 told Modern Shipper. “Today, what is done with market funding, now it 
will find a more equilibrium [of investment]. To really do it well and 
always find the most efficient driver to satisfy your customer at a 
margin that works for you, you need to digitize.”
The last mile is
 going through change and doing so rapidly. Like a startup company that 
invested heavily in scaling before trying to find its true profitability
 model, the last mile is now looking to find its equilibrium — that 
perfect mix of providers, technology and customer service.
According to ShipBob, 73% of shoppers
 expect affordable, fast deliveries when ordering online. But what is 
affordable to the customer is not always affordable to the shipper. A 
2021 Gartner report found that retailers with 50% or more of their sales
 coming from online channels saw logistics costs 50% above those of 
retailers with primarily in-store sales.
A
 report from Precedence Research said the last-mile delivery 
transportation market was $179.96 billion in 2021 and will grow to 
$423.3 billion by 2030.
Free shipping declines
Clearly,
 there is opportunity ahead. And it’s possible — in fact even likely — 
that what is happening today is just a preview of the changes to come. A
 Gartner analysis of 500 leading retailers found there has been a 12.5% decline
 in the number of retailers offering free shipping and a 30% reduction 
in those offering free shipping on returns between late 2019 and August 
2020. 
“What we used to see was subsidization of last-mile  delivery by gig fleets and now we see that relaxing so the market will  be more competitive,” Bloch said. “Gig is the new way of continuing [to  service the customer] and we see what used to be standard shipping  over the years start to move to local delivery. A year or  two years ago, the gig fleets subsidized a lot of the adoption. … What  we are going to see is it will be less subsidized than before.”
Two  recent reports on the state of the last mile have previewed some of the  changes, and real-world feedback from one of the globe’s largest  retailers highlights the struggles brands are facing in meeting this new  demand.
Omnichannel demands grow
“Logistics
 and delivery providers are trying to meet the growing demand for 
competitive omnichannel delivery services demanded by shippers and end 
customers, including same-day delivery, ship-from-store and returns. 
These require greater speed, and agility, and often a restructuring of 
resources, technologies and operational processes,” the report noted.
In
 a survey of 200 logistics and transportation leaders from North America
 and Europe, the report found that 68% of respondents already offered 
same-day delivery or will do so by the end of this year, and 27% believe
 offering returns (which can be as high as 30% of online orders) and 
pickup services provide a strategic advantage.
Still, connectivity
 is a major roadblock, with 44% citing shipper onboarding and 
integration of carriers as an operational pain point, and 44% also 
saying visibility into outsourced delivery partners is an issue. Another
 41% said carrier and driver management were issues.
The Roman 
mancipes simply commandeered wagons and other needs along the way, but 
today’s last-mile delivery network is a bit more sophisticated.
“[The
 industry] is calling and screaming for technology to kick in,” Bloch 
said. “It’s a big change. It’s a major force that none of us control in 
finding the equilibrium.”
Bloch went on to say that he expects 
companies to start acting more strategically in developing their 
last-mile delivery strategies.
“Based on the needs of the market, retailers are perfecting [their strategies] in different ways,” he said.
American Eagle logistics flies high
Global American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) is one of those companies. In 2021, AEO (NYSE: AEO) acquired both AirTerra and Quiet Logistics,
 the former being a logistics technology company and the latter being a 
third-party logistics provider that services omnichannel needs for more 
than 50 brands.
The acquisitions were merged into Quiet Platforms. In its latest earnings release
 on Friday, the outfitter said that its supply chain acquisitions 
contributed about 3 percentage points to the company’s 2% revenue growth
 in Q1.
In an April webinar for project44, Bill Besselman, senior 
vice president of supply chain execution at AEO, said a rethinking of 
the company’s supply chain is helping it manage the last mile.
“When
 we thought about the last mile, we realized the last mile wasn’t a mile
 at all, it was 1,300 miles,” he said. “Thirteen hundred miles was a 
barrier for two reasons — one is speed, and the other is cost. We needed
 to rethink the supply chain.”
Besselman went on to say that AEO 
realized it needed to relocate merchandise closer to the end consumer to
 shorten inbound times to stores and delivery times to customers, but 
that the diversification of the last-mile carrier market was creating 
new challenges.
“There is an opportunity for us as midsized 
retailers and brands to get after these problems differently than what 
we have done in the past,” he said.
Brittle supply chains
“One
 of the things we learned during the pandemic is that supply chains are 
very brittle and they are not very successful [if something breaks],” 
Besselman added, noting that 58% of AEO transactions now take place 
online. “Carrier selection is incredibly important to us. [Different] 
carriers allow us to offer different services.”
That is a point 
that Bloch repeated, pointing to the relaxing of subsidies to fund the 
last mile leading to more competition in the space as logistics 
providers look for sustainable and profitable paths forward.
“We are going through a major transformation and what we all [thought] in theory [is no more],” he said.
“The
 way I look at it, we are about to finish the first wave of COVID, the 
reactive wave,” Bloch added. “The consumer hasn’t gone back to the 
pre-COVID days, they got rewired. Now we are flipping to the second wave
 and the second wave is how do you build a robust infrastructure [to 
sustain e-commerce and last-mile delivery].”
A significant portion of a sustainable last mile involves ways to better manage returns.
“My
 perspective is if you want to play in the online game, which is 
different than the offline game, part of that is returns,” Bloch said. 
“Returns hurt the margins of the business. What I see more retailers do 
is find creative ways to manage returns.”
And more providers are jumping into the returns game. In March, DoorDash (NYSE: DASH) announced it was testing a returns program that allowed its drivers to pick up returns at a customer’s home and deliver it to the nearest FedEx, UPS or post office. Unicorn upstart Veho is also testing a returns program, as are others.
Returns offer a path to profitability
Bloch said services like returns are part of the evolution of the last-mile delivery space.
“Once
 it’s democratized, once it’s digitized, once it’s connected, you can 
start developing flows that serve your business,” he said.
The 
last-mile delivery wheels are spinning, and it is technology powering 
the revolution. The Bringg survey found that for businesses struggling 
with managing last-mile delivery vehicles and providers, only 22% use 
efficiency solutions such as automated order batching or auto dispatch 
and routing. Just 27% of logistics providers offer self-scheduling.
Driver
 wages are also an issue, with 65% saying they are paying drivers more 
in 2022 than they did in 2021, but 38% say driver satisfaction and 
retention remain issues. For an industry that depends on gig drivers 
able to work for any platform on a given day, wages may play an outsized
 role.
“The more the market becomes competitive, the more we will 
need to increase wages,” Bloch said. “As we continue the next couple of 
years and find the equilibrium, we will see more and more fleets 
increase wages. Remember, these drivers are 1099 [workers] so they can 
work for you or another company, and many work for multiple platforms. 
What’s important is to bring competition into the market.”
Ultimately, the progression of the last mile is being driven by one factor that Besselman explained in his presentation.
“We  are excited about the customer experience opportunity because supply  chain has emerged from the back to a customer-centric function,” he  said.

More than 50 organizations agree to make shared mobility the first, best choice over private car use.
Nearly
 50 public, private and nonprofit organizations announced a major 
initiative to develop and advance the Shared Mobility Action Agenda so 
that by 2030, equitable, low-carbon shared mobility will be more 
convenient, more practical, more available, easier to use and more 
accessible and affordable than driving a car. 
“The gas price 
spike has – again – made many of us painfully aware of our overreliance 
on cars. While electrification is necessary, it’s not enough to solve 
our systemic mobility problems,” said Benjamin de la Peña, CEO of the 
Shared-Use Mobility Center. “The Agenda and Action Network intend to 
make shared mobility the first and best option over car ownership within
 the decade. We need to do this to fight climate change, make mobility 
more equitable, and to help households save money. This isn’t just 
another sign-on document. We’ve developed a to-do list to actually get 
it done.” 
This is a pivotal moment for the future of 
transportation. Low-income households spend almost 40 percent of their 
income on transportation. Shared-Use Mobility Center (SUMC) says the 
latest research shows that the nation is running out of time to take 
bold action on the climate crisis. The number of people killed by 
drivers nationwide while walking increased almost 50 percent over the 
last decade, and more of the victims were older adults and people of 
color, says SUMC. 
“Shared mobility strategies can deliver on the 
promise of safer roads, more equitable transportation, and the 
sustainable movement of people and goods – if done right. That’s why 
we’re here,” said Marla Westervelt, vice president of policy at 
Coalition for Reimagined Mobility. “Coming together with an influential 
network of public, private and community advocates, we can collaborate 
and act to shape the transportation of tomorrow and address the current 
global energy security and climate crises.” 
More than 50 public, 
private and non-profit organizations have already committed to advancing
 the agenda, which supports all shared transportation options, from 
public transportation to ride-hail, from car-sharing to on-demand 
responsive microtransit, from shared bikes and scooters to paratransit. 
In advance of the release of version 1.0 of the agenda later this 
summer, the immediate goal is to continue to grow the number of 
participating organizations and gain even more momentum. 
“As
 the global leader in TransitTech, we believe in a world where everyone 
has access to efficient, affordable mobility. The cost of car ownership 
is higher than many families can afford, but far too often is the only 
way to access jobs, education and healthcare. Technology to make transit
 flexible and shared can help all types of communities -from rural towns
 to big cities increase economic opportunity for their residents while 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” said Hind Ourahou, Mobility Policy 
principal at Via. 
The International Energy Association finds that
 having more shared rides and using more public transportation and 
micromobility can reduce global oil consumption by as much as 800,000 
barrels per day, which is nearly 300 million barrels per year, saving 
money and reducing harmful air pollutants. 
“The devil is always 
in the details,” said Kevin Chambers, founder and principal of Full Path
 Transit Technology. “There are so many ways that shared mobility can be
 done wrong. Getting so many organizations and individuals with 
different perspectives together to collaborate on the best paths forward
 will help ensure we make measurable advances on shared mobility. A 
priority for me has been making sure that the agenda includes the needs 
of rural and community-based mobility services.” 
Another  benefit of moving to shared mobility is communities can stop ceding  valuable property to parking lots and highways and adding to existing  maintenance deficits on miles and miles of land currently dedicated to  moving and accommodating cars. The agenda aims to ensure we maximize the  benefits of making shared mobility more convenient than driving a car.

Friendly regulatory environment bolsters efforts by 70 companies, including Baidu, Alibaba 
By CRAIG S. SMITH 
Chinese tech giant Baidu opened a 2.5-acre test track and operations base for autonomous vehicles last week, its third such site in the country and its latest move to dominate the “robotaxi” industry.
China’s self-driving vehicle market is moving faster than that of the United States thanks to government regulatory support. In the past year, Baidu and AV competitor AutoX, backed by e-commerce giant Alibaba, have announced a series of steps in the race toward what promises to be a massive market.
Swiss bank UBS estimates that by 2030, the global robotaxi market will be worth at least $2 trillion annually, with robotaxi fleet purchases accounting for 12% of all new cars sold.
In April last year, Baidu began offering free robotaxi trips in Changsha within a pre-defined area, followed by Cangzhou and Beijing. Then, in December, AutoX launched a trial of driverless robotaxis in the southern city of Shenzhen and opened that service to the public in January this year. In May, Baidu started commercial robotaxi service within a 1.2 square-mile zone in western Beijing and last month opened a pilot program to the public covering a 60-square-mile district in the southern city of Guangzhou.
The Shanghai operations center will serve as a base for Baidu’s Apollo brand robotaxis, robobuses and other types of autonomous vehicles in the region. The base will collect data and calibrate connected vehicles and act as a remote control center.
“Our base will serve as an intelligent connectivity ecosystem and expand to over 200 operating vehicles to become the largest autonomous driving fleet in East China,” said a Baidu spokesperson.
AutoX opened a robotaxi operations center in Shanghai last year, and has been offering limited robotaxi service to the public in Shanghai for more than a year. The company’s robotaxi service in Shenzhen, meanwhile, operates without a safety driver or operator in the car. “This is still the only fully driverless RoboTaxi operation in China until today,” said Jewel Z. Li, AutoX’s chief operating officer.
This is still the only fully driverless RoboTaxi operation in China until today.
Since Beijing approved self-driving car tests on designated public roads more than three years ago, dozens of cities have awarded pilot program permits to more than 70 companies.
Chinese regulators began allowing limited robotaxi trials June 2019 and this January, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology released a draft policy permitting AV testing on highways with a goal of opening the robotaxi market by 2025.
Baidu has announced plans to deploy 3,000 robotaxis in 30 Chinese cities by the end of 2023. AutoX and WeRide, which is backed by the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, have similarly ambitious goals.
Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-hailing company that has recently faced Chinese regulatory troubles, also operates a fleet of autonomous vehicles.
China is pursuing other self-driving vehicle applications, including autonomous heavy trucks. Baidu is working on a robotic excavator system with the University of Maryland, integrating perception, planning, and control capabilities to enable material loading with no human intervention. The excavation system has been deployed in real-world scenarios, operating continuously for over 24 hours at a time.

Across Europe, as cities get to grips with road congestion, air pollution and meeting climate targets, the manual and electric cargo bike is rapidly delivering. Nimble, clean and efficient in urban settings, the cargo bike is quickly becoming the default transport choice for logistics companies, food delivery services and even plumbers.
‘Cargo bikes’ is a catch-all phrase for bicycles that are adapted to carry heavier or bulkier loads, or even passengers and children. For cities, the cargo bike presents a win-win at an important turning point as e-commerce companies and food delivery services continue their dizzying rise. The humble cargo bike presents businesses with a way to increase urban deliveries, improve the speed and reliability of those deliveries, while removing diesel-fuelled delivery vans from urban roads.
A recent study from climate charity and Rapid Transition Alliance member, Possible, found that electric cargo bikes deliver 60% faster than vans in urban centres, totting up higher average speeds and dropping off ten parcels an hour, compared to a van’s six. The same report found that cargo bikes cut emissions by 90% compared with diesel vans and by a third when compared with electric vans.
Cargo bikes have also revolutionised the urban school run, with some holding up to eight children becoming an increasingly  common sight in Denmark, the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, London. The result is less congested roads, more breathable air, fewer road traffic accidents, a radical drop in carbon emissions and a flourishing ecosystem of businesses that can go direct to their customers without harming the environment.
And, the cargo bike market is booming. In Germany, nearly 100,000 e-cargo bikes are sold every year, with its neighbour France ratcheting up around 50,000 sales a year. The UK is a little behind, totting up only 2,000 e-cargo bike sales for commercial use last year. But, this is only set to be temporary, with sales expected to jump by 60% this year and a market size set to increase by 15-fold within the next five years. This rate of growth is set to be mirrored across Europe too, with sales expected to increase by 50% year on year. By 2030, estimates suggest annual European sales of one million cargo bikes for commercial uses and a further one million sales for family cargo bikes.
Wider relevance
The coming age of the cargo bike provides a fascinating insight into rapid transition – and is one that can be replicated in other sectors if we can get all the ingredients right. A combination of private enterprise, government support, design and manufacturing breakthroughs, standardisation and cross-border collaboration have created the conditions where both the demand for cargo bikes, and the supply coming to market, are on an inexorable rise. Alongside these factors has been the enabling power of digital technology, where app-based platforms and digital bike-sharing schemes are increasing the accessibility to cargo bikes for city dwellers, boosting demand and visibility.
While enabled by high-tech manufacturing and improvements in battery technology, the cargo bike craze sweeping across Europe can also be understood as an effective, relatively low-tech climate solution, reorienting transport away from the fossil fuelled-vehicles towards low-impact, low-cost and long-term solutions which have multiple additional benefits. At a time when technologies – both those available and those yet to be invented – often receive disproportionate attention in climate policy debates, the rise of cargo bikes can remind us of how some of the smartest, most easily deployed tools for transition are those that we already have: they are tried and tested.
Scaling up cargo bikes in urban centres can also help lay the foundations for other low-carbon and clean air initiatives, as well as countering the worrying trend of increased car use induced by pandemic fears of using public transport. By providing a solution for industry and businesses to access their customer base and move through urban spaces without the need for cars and vans, cargo bikes can become a enabler for Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs), reducing the allocation of road space for cars which can allow pop-up gardens and Playful Streets to emerge throughout cities, where communities can play without fearing traffic. In a post-pandemic world, where the necessity of e-commerce and food delivery services are perhaps here to stay, finding ways of getting goods from A to B in a sustainable fashion is vital.
There is also a broader economic relevance, where the rising demand for cargo bikes is boosting employment in industrial heartlands. The iconic UK-based bike manufacturer, Raleigh, has only been selling cargo bikes for a few years, but they have already seen their sales increase by 75% last year at their Nottingham manufacturing facility. Raleigh recently partnered with another UK institution – the National Trust – to deploy cargo bikes at their larger sites to help with maintenance and moving supplies around. Raleigh have also partnered with the family dairy company, Jones Bros, providing them with cargo bikes for their London deliveries, replacing the diesel van they used to use for their 10-mile delivery route. With cargo bikes, we are seeing a rich array of collaborations between manufacturers and businesses, who are running pilots to garner an understanding how both their business offerings and bottom lines can be improved by the introduction of cargo bikes.
Context and background
Cargo bikes present an opportunity and solution for both local governments and businesses. Cities around the world are grappling with the issue of poisonous air, where an increase in motor traffic and congestion in urban centres is creating air which is a danger to human health – especially the health of children. Globally, air pollution kills an estimated seven million people a year. In the UK, noxious air is responsible for approximately 40,000 deaths per year. Getting cars off the roads and out of densely populated urban areas is therefore a priority for cities – and reducing the number of larger, diesel-fuelled delivery vans is the best place to start. According to data from the Department for Transport, van traffic in London has grown by 71% over the last two decades, with 47% of the 3.8 million vans registered since 1996 attributed to businesses. In London, it’s estimated that up to 14% of small van journeys in the most congested parts of the city could be made with cargo bikes. In Dublin, postal giant UPS has been trialling a cargo bike hub approach, where two e-trikes have replaced four delivery vans, removing around 500 van-delivered packages from their supply chain and cutting their Dublin-based emissions by 40%.
At the same time, the demand for e-commerce goods, food delivery services and other platform-based, convenience-fuelled ventures are clogging up urban centres with traffic, noise and making the air unbreathable. For e-commerce especially, the roaring demand for same day and next day delivery is causing logistics giants a major headache, causing them to pour in billions of investment into so-called last-mile delivery services. And while venture capitalist and techo-futurists would have you believe that autonomous postal robots are just around the corner, it is the humble cargo bike that’s allowing e-commerce to unlock the last mile puzzle. Some estimates of the financial benefits to businesses range from 70-90% cost savings compared to reliance on delivery vans. Plus, it’s not just the likes of Amazon and UPS getting on their bikes, national postal services are filling up the cargo bike manufacturers’ order books too. Ireland’s national postal service, An Post, recently ordered over 100 e-trikes from the German manufacturer Radkutsche.
The cargo bike craze is a great example of how the co-benefits of rapid transition can quickly align.
Enabling factors
Support from Government and business
The cargo bike craze has been fostered, in part, by a strong policy toolkit across Europe, ranging from local government grants and national subsidies to private business offerings. In the UK, the Department for Transport (DfT) launched their eCargo Bike Grant Fund for businesses and organisations in 2019 and has already awarded over £2 million in grants. In fact, the grant scheme has unlocked such a vast amount of demand for cargo bikes that in 2020, 58 councils across the UK submitted bids totalling £4.2 million – creating a positive problem for the UK to fill these grants to get the wheels in motion.
The business improvement district, Team London Bridge, is currently running a business engagement strategy that has been hugely successful. As part of the programme, Team London Bridge contacts businesses and organisations active with the London Bridge area and helps them bring cargo bikes into their everyday operations in order to capture the numerous benefits. In the Netherlands, a country famed for its cycling culture, the tech-firm Cargoroo has launched an app-based public cargo bike share scheme so everyone can benefit from the cargo bike.
Standardisation for safety
Despite cycling being around for hundreds of years, the cargo bike is something that is relatively modern. And as the sales of cargo bikes boom across Europe, manufacturers and industrial groups are busy creating a European cargo bike standard, which was launched last year. While there are already national standards in France and Germany, the regional growth in the cargo bike market is causing manufacturers to push for greater standardisation across the board. At the front of everyone’s minds is safety – but there are divergent opinions on issues such as bike width, payload and length. Once an agreement is reached, manufacturers will have the certainty they need to push ahead with boosting supply.
The commercial opportunity 
There are plenty of financial gains from deploying cargo bikes throughout a businesses’ supply chain. From reducing the overheads of entering low emissions zones, or the mounting parking fines that many companies face, to having the speed and agility to glide through traffic or even reach areas that motorised vehicles can’t, cargo bikes look like a no-brainer for many firms operating in this space. And it’s not just logistics firms and e-commerce giants who are hopping on the cargo bike craze, many businesses that have to transfer goods as part of their service provision are exploring the potential of cargo bikes: be they plumbers, ice cream vendors or window cleaners.
Cross-city collaboration & advocacy
Alongside cross-border standardisation, comes a deeper form of collaboration. Organisations like the EU-funded CityChangerCaroBike have been expanding to partner cities all over Europe, publishing guidance and advice on scaling up cargo bikes and cycle infrastructure, as well as sharing stories of cargo-biking ‘Local Heroes’. Helping to present cities and national governments in the heart of power is the European Cycle Logistics Federation, which recently launched a strategic partnership with Cycling Industries Europe to create a more unified, stronger advocacy platform for cycling logistics businesses in Europe.
Scope and evidence

In Germany, nearly 100,000 cargo bikes are sold every year, with its neighbour France ratcheting up around 50,000 sales a year. The UK is a little behind, totting up only 2,000 cargo bike sales for commercial use last year.
The UK is forecast to increase by 60% this year and the market size is set to inflate by 15-fold within the next five years.
By 2030, estimates suggest annual European sales of one million cargo bikes for commercial uses and a further one million sales for family cargo bikes.
The UK-based bike manufacturer, Raleigh, has only been selling cargo bikes for a few years but they have already seen their sales increase by 75% last year at their Nottingham manufacturing facility.
Sales across Europe are growing at around 50% year on year.
A recent study from Possible found that electric cargo bikes deliver 60% faster than vans in urban centres, totting up higher average speeds and dropping off ten parcels an hour, compared to a van’s six.
The Possible report found that cargo bikes cut emissions by 90% compared with diesel vans and by a third when compared with electric vans.
The cargo bike boom is, in part, being driven by shifts in consumer habits that have shifted due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, with the number of UK consumers doing a weekly grocery shop online doubling since the first lockdown.
By 2030, estimates suggest annual European sales of one million cargo bikes for commercial uses and a further one million sales for family cargo bikes.

Lessons for rapid transition

It is easy to overlook old, unglamorous technologies that can play a big, new role in rapid transition: a perfect storm of road congestion, traffic threats, air pollution and changes in how people buy things has elevated the cargo bike from a niche transport option to a mainstream delivery choice. Cargo bikes offer a win-win solution for cities, residents, safer streets, the environment and businesses alike.
Greening growing industries early is vital to meeting climate targets: With spending habits shifting during the Covid-19 pandemic, providing low-impact and low-emissions solutions for new, expanding markets is essential.
The public sector can be a market maker by enabling transitions: Government and business can work hand-in-hand at a local level to scale up low-impact climate solutions through grant schemes in order to capture the social and commercial benefits. And, mutual learning and collaboration across cities makes roll-out easier.

 While Back to the Future’s vision of a world with hoverboards and flying cars has yet to come true, transport is changing, and Intelligent Transport Systems are the driving force behind these developments. A new research partnership between the University of the Sunshine Coast (USC) and the Queensland Government will help prepare the state for futuristic transport that uses emerging technologies to better connect people and goods in more sustainable, efficient and convenient ways. 
By Patricia Mae Tagabe

USC Senior Lecturer in Environmental Engineering, Dr Helen Fairweather, said the three-year Transport Academic Partnership, including the Department of Transport and Main Roads’ funding support, was not only exciting for the university’s students and academics, but would also have a profound impact on the wider community and environment.
“Transport is changing rapidly, and we need more research that targets the interface between civil infrastructure and the Internet of Things (IoT),” Dr Fairweather said.
“The key questions are: How do we move people and goods without relying on systems for fuel-emitting cars, and how can technology help us achieve that?
“It’s not just about electric cars and light rail. It’s about how telecommunications and advanced analytics can change how our transport network operates and how more sustainable service can be provided.”
Dr Fairweather said that the specific research projects will be jointly developed with the Department of Transport and Main Roads once a foundation USC Chair of Sustainable Transport Engineering has been appointed at its Moreton Bay campus.
However, initial areas of focus would include the use of big data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart transport.
The Moreton Bay campus will become a field site for testing cutting-edge transport innovations, such as:
♦ New IoT sensor technologies for Intelligent Transport Systems
♦ Advanced video imagery for providing information about vehicle movements and assessing areas of traffic congestion
♦ Access to vehicle-based data to analyse driver and passenger behaviour
♦ Advanced AI to understand differences amongst distinct road user groups in typical traffic situations Dr Fairweather said that Intelligent Transport Systems have delivered important but incremental changes to Australia’s transport systems, and the momentum to advance Australia’s transport technology industries is only growing.
“We are already seeing major changes in terms of the way traffic moves in the cities, e.g. using sensors, CCTV footage and AI to better control traffic lights and variable speed signs to improve traffic flow.
This is providing a 20-30 per cent uplift in capacity for the same infrastructure, supporting more sustainable outcomes,” Dr Fairweather said.
“Electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles will be the single biggest transformation over the coming decade as the technology is proven now, and scale and affordability will come as the volume of sales increase.
“Full situational awareness of the transport network will become more customer focused, enabling customers to make more informed choices around whether to travel, what mode of transport to use, when to travel and what on-trip changes are necessary to optimise their journey.
“There are some innovations in terms of maintenance using video captured by vehicles and AI to improve the response to road maintenance needs.
Flooding alerts in regional areas are becoming more sophisticated which is critical for road users, particularly in preventing motorists from entering flooded roads.”
Predictions for future transport technology innovations
According to Dr Fairweather, futuristic transport technologies are not far on the horizon as we start to see vehicles with connected and autonomous technologies emerging over the next couple of decades.
“Connectivity of vehicles to roadside infrastructure and the ability for vehicles to exchange information and data (talk to each other) is already emerging in Europe, USA and Asia.
These technologies will be critical in improving safety and will be important in the roadmap to full automation,” Dr Fairweather said.
“Depending on how this is rolled out between industry suppliers, government regulators and road authorities, this is likely to blur the current distinction between private vehicle ownership and public transport.
“The Mobility as a Service (MAAS) model, where people subscribe to a suite of transport options and pay a monthly fee as opposed to having to own anything, could therefore become a viable service offering.
This subscription package would include access to everything – public transport, e-transport (e.g.. electric scooters), cars, buses, trains etc.
“I do see a time when we will be able to use personal mobility options for first and last mile transport between major bus and rail networks, though active transport (e.g. cycling and walking) provides a better option in terms of public health outcomes.”
Dr Fairweather said one potential technology of the future could consist of multi-purpose on-demand freight/passenger options with ‘capsules’ linked to a trackless tram-type system.
Each business might be able to call for a ‘freight capsule’ to go past their door, or use drones to transport lighter freight to the nearest capsule.
Perhaps the capsule can be configured quickly to change from a transport to a freight option to optimise its use. “Overall, autonomous public transport options will be cheaper to run and will become more accessible to regional communities, lessening their reliance on private vehicles, while big data analytics and AI will provide for more optimum traffic networks in the future,” Dr Fairweather said.
“In terms of sustainability, I think there will be a greater focus on the fuels and construction materials we’re using, Building Information Modelling (BIM) to conceive, design, build and manage transport infrastructure, transition to more active transport and better understanding of the socio-economic aspects of equity when it comes to access to public transport options.”
Collaboration key to improving Australia’stransport networks
Transport and Main Roads Minister, Mark Bailey, said the Queensland Government welcomed the opportunity to work with USC and look ahead at new, innovative ideas that would enable all Australians to move more safely, efficiently, and sustainably through the nation’s transport networks.
“This partnership will enable USC to research and provide insights into the type of technologies we will use to move from A to B in the next few decades,” Mr Bailey said.
“Queensland is well placed to be at the forefront of transport innovation. I look forward to the team’s work exploring how future technology can boost our capability to deliver a single, integrated transport network accessible to everyone.”
Dr Fairweather agreed that Queensland is well placed to be at the forefront of transport innovation compared to other states because the Department of Transport and Main Roads understands the importance of partnering with academia to accelerate the development and deployment of technologies that will shape the future of transport.
“The department has positioned itself to undertake and make use of the latest cutting-edge research in the transport field through their investment in a Transport Academic Partnerships across Brisbane Partner Universities, with the intent to extend that to other regional universities,” Dr Fairweather said.
“They are very mindful that the skills required of their workforce is rapidly changing and the university partnerships will be critical to providing the courses for this upskilling.
“They also make an active investment in applied research programs so they can continue to improve, adapt and adopt new ways of doing things.”
As part of a Transport Academic Partnership, Department of Transport and Main Roads will provide advice on their research needs to ensure the research projects align with their strategic plan and the Queensland Government priorities of supporting economic activity and job creation, improving community safety and protecting the environment.
“Through this research partnership, civil infrastructure and IoT will become better integrated by developing and deploying the appropriate and fit-for-use technology and communication protocols to protect individual privacy and maximise cyber security, while providing the analytics to make a major shift in the development and operation of our transport infrastructure,” Dr Fairweather said.

In order to restore vitality to urban areas, authorities will need to focus on reducing carbon emissions.Transforming the transportation sector will be particularly important, write two experts from the International Finance Corporation.The World Bank has released steps for sustainable financing strategies, which include investment reviews and cash injections into public transit.These are stepping stones to a greener, resilient and inclusive urban recovery from COVID-19.
Rapid movement of people and goods has always defined thriving cities. But the COVID-19 pandemic slowed much of that movement, and the way forward is uncertain. One thing is clear, efforts to restore vitality to urban areas need to be tempered with a profound willingness to rebuild in a less carbon-intensive manner.As municipal leaders tackle the challenges of leading their cities out of crisis mode, the transportation sector will play a key role in a greener, resilient and inclusive recovery. Smart transportation planning can create jobs and lay the groundwork for sustainable urban growth.An IFC analysis found that cities that prioritize green transportation stand to gain from an investment opportunity of as much as $2.7 trillion. It is estimated that the green transportation sector will create some 53 million direct jobs across emerging market countries by 2030. As urbanization accelerates around the world, it is more important than ever that transit systems reduce their carbon-dependency . Well-planned urban transit is a critical component of the world-wide effort to stem climate change.
The COVID-19 crisis presented significant challenges to municipal transit operators. As ridership rates fell between 50 percent and 90 percent, mass transit operators were forced to bear substantial costs for salaries and system maintenance. There is little doubt that a strong demand for mass transit will return. Mass transit is the most affordable option for the vast majority of the world’s urban residents, and it is essential that all transit services are safe, reliable and eco-friendly. Given the essential role public transport plays in emerging market economies, governmental support for both public and private operators is crucial to sustain operations in the short term and improve service levels in the long term.
The World Bank has published steps for sustainable financing strategies, including investment reviews and cash injections. The challenge for rapidly growing cities in lower-income countries is particularly severe, as scaling public transit requires keeping prices low. Subsidies are usually required to improve services and invest in technology, and finding the resources to subsidies can be difficult.
One step which urban leaders can take now is to improve access to electric vehicles (EVs). For example, IFC supported Ukraine’s Galnaftogaz (GNG), the country’s leading retail distributor of transportation fuels, to help promote electric passenger vehicles uptake by investing in fast-charging stations. The project will enable the company to avoid annual greenhouse gas emissions of around 4,990 tons of carbon dioxide. Increasing the proportion of EVs on the road makes urban air cleaner for everyone. (Transport pollution is a major contributor to respiratory illness in cities around the world).
Municipalities can work with the private sector to invest in EV charging stations and other EV infrastructure. With appropriate zoning modifications, EV infrastructure can be built near bus and rail hubs, where it can serve mass transit and commercial delivery needs.
New bus rapid transit systems, also called BRTs, are another affordable and flexible way to improve urban transit while also stimulating the local economy. Carefully planned stations, digital ticketing and platform-level boarding make for easy and efficient loading and unloading of people and goods.
It is crucial to ensure that public transit remains a reliable and practical option for everyone, including those who use mobility devices and push strollers. BRTs typically replace old buses with new fleets that may feature intelligent transportation systems, which allows system operators to improve rider satisfaction and reduce traffic congestion. Dedicated smartphone apps allow riders to plan their journeys with precision. System operators can use this data to optimize bus schedules and operations for efficiency.
In 2021, IFC helped the city of Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine to develop and introduce a smart city platform, as well as modernize and upgrade its public transport system. IFC’s EUR35 million investment will help the municipality rehabilitate up to 2 kilometers of roads on one of the city’s center streets, purchase modern battery-electric trolleybuses and electric buses, and upgrade the electric transport infrastructure.
The project will help reduce traffic congestion and pollution in urban areas, optimize traffic management, and provide better digital services to ensure the quality and sustainability of communal services.
Although mass transit usage declined during the pandemic, increased reliance on e-commerce resulted in a massive surge of urban delivery traffic. Last-mile delivery companies scrambled to meet an increase in demand without sacrificing their own efficiency. In the process, many of these companies invested in smart tracking systems and upgraded their intelligent routing and fleet management software.
The surge in demand for clean, cost-effective last-mile delivery solutions has created an unprecedented opportunity for cities to forge alliances with the private sector. Cities can lead the way by designing clean transit solutions which work for businesses and local residents . In emerging markets, two and three-wheeled EV logistics, which are already becoming cost competitive with fossil fuel options, can be encouraged.
What’s the World Economic Forum doing about the future of cities?
Journeys may change, but the importance of rapid movement within cities will remain. Advances in data management software and intelligent traffic systems allow municipalities to control both traffic and pollution more effectively than ever before.
IFC can help plan and finance transit projects as cities plan their emergence from unprecedented crisis. We have the tools to ensure that recovery plans continue the global effort to reduce climate change.
The silver lining of the COVID-19 crisis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rethink the world’s cities. New technologies enable cities to plan and rebuild greener and smarter than ever before. Deploying transport solutions driven by smart technologies and innovative tools will be key to build healthy, thriving post-pandemic cities where people and goods move with ease.

 AI has a pivotal role to play in revolutionizing the logistics industry.
By Madhurjya Chowdhury

Everything grew increasingly digital as a result of globalization; consumers began to buy more online and expect their products or services to be delivered faster and for less money. In today’s fast-paced world, logistics and supply chains must adapt to quickly changing consumer demands. As per ML news, supply chains waste hours each day on paperwork, resulting in a yearly loss of more than $170,000. Using AI for some of the jobs is one approach to improve the issue. Transferring certain manual activities to machines can help alleviate the problem of paper-based paperwork while also increasing productivity. In this article, you will explore how AI is contributing to the logistics industry.
AI Impact on Logistics
Artificial intelligence has radically altered the logistics and supply chain industries. Here are five ways that AI-driven technology may help businesses enhance and innovate their logistics and supply chain operations.
1. Robotics
Robotics refers to the use of intelligent machines in the supply chain management process. As per Statista research, revenues of logistics service robotics would reach more than $6 billion in 2021. Robots can generally do routine operations such as delivery, transportation, storing, picking, packaging, and routing. The primary distinction between regular industrial robots and AI-assisted robots is that the latter can execute more complicated jobs without the need for human intervention. Smart robots may also evolve by learning new tasks and executing increasingly complicated behaviors. It means that this gear can partially, and in some circumstances completely, replace humans in the distribution process, making it more predictable, simple to regulate, and successful. Drones, for example, may transport a certain amount of load and can fly or move on land or water. RFID (radio-frequency identification) solutions can sort, identify, and deliver items through the warehouse autonomously. As a result, robotics in logistics can boost production while also making it easier for humans to manage the various phases of delivery.
2. Autonomous Vehicles
Autonomous vehicles have the potential to dramatically improve delivery efficiency. This technology has the potential to improve dependability, cost efficiency, and predictability. Even though we have yet to acquire completely autonomous delivery vehicles, it is just a matter of time. As technology advances, it is conceivable to anticipate that in the not-too-distant future, consumers will get their shipments without the need for human intervention. According to the Mckinsey research, autonomous vehicles, especially drones, will deliver over 80% of all packages. By overcoming transportation obstacles and inconveniences, this technology will improve the efficiency of the distribution process.
3. Computer Vision
Every vision system is made up of two major components: the camera and the “brain” computer that controls everything. Based on a sophisticated algorithm, it can detect objects, goods, particular activities, colors, and perform actions. This technology may be used to identify damage and increase productivity in the production process. Amazon, for example, employs a computer vision-based AI system to offload a trailer of merchandise in 30 minutes rather than the hours it would take without it.
Furthermore, computer vision-enabled systems can automatically detect damage, determining the cause of the damage, its severity, and taking steps to prevent future cargo mishaps. The loading and unloading of products is another application of computer vision. This technology not only recognizes and locates items and packages in the store, but it also does so autonomously. With this in mind, machine learning systems are extensively utilized to reduce customer churn, improve supply chain quality, and improve the delivery process’s security.
4. Predictive Analysis
Any logistics firm must be able to function efficiently, deliver on time, and save transportation expenses. To accomplish this, an in-depth study based on historical data is required to detect risk trends, implement corrective steps, and generate projections. You can only dramatically enhance logistics operations, modify shipment patterns, offer on delivery, and forecast consumer behavior by utilizing predictive analysis. MHI Annual Industry Survey for 2020 stated that the percentage of logistics companies using predictive analysis took a flight from 17% in 2017 to 30% in 2019. It can not only improve supply chain visibility, optimize routes, and make tracking and planning shipments easier, but it can also identify unexpected circumstances and hazards. If properly implemented, it will considerably decrease operating expenses and assist businesses in making more informed decisions.
5. Big Data
Logistics, like every other business, generate a considerable volume of data. It would have been more difficult to handle all of this material without a well-maintained data management system. Companies can save money and avoid late shipments and deliveries by collecting data from multiple sources such as drivers’ applications, devices, and systems, and assessing how various elements impact the delivery process. You may obtain insight into historical delivery statistics, driver ratings, and make changes using big data analytics. More than 91% of Fortune 1000 firms, according to the study, are investing in big data. Furthermore, AI-driven data analytics enables businesses to account for variables such as fleet maintenance schedules, vehicle sensors, inclement weather, and fuel costs. It not only provides drivers with destination ideas and helps them travel more effectively, but it also allows businesses to reduce logistical expenses on a route-by-route basis.
Conclusion
By bringing new methods of dealing with data and improvements across the whole supply chain, AI is changing logistics procedures. Predictive analysis, robots, computer vision, deep learning, and autonomous vehicles are examples of technology that can greatly improve logistics and supply chain performance. They have the ability to alter the way items are managed in warehouses, as well as optimize last-mile delivery and logistics networks. With this in mind, logistics and supply chain firms could consider these technologies as a means of enhancing efficiency and lowering costs.

 The shared e-scooter could become as common on city streets as a bus, or even cars, according to those in the industry. 
By Skip Descant 
The shared e-scooter could become as common on city streets as a bus, or even cars, according to those in the industry.
“What
 was new, and kind of different over the last five years or so, scooters
 have become much more mainstream,” said Ashwini Chhabra, chief public 
policy officer at TIER Mobility, the world’s largest shared 
micromobility operator. The company recently acquired Spin. 
“They’ve  become more like how cities approached bike-share. And I think that  transition will continue to where I think these services will be  embraced much in the way that the city bus is considered to be as  American as the library and the post office,” Chhabra added, speaking on  a panel discussion last month at the CoMotion MIAMI conference. “It may  have started out as a private service, but it provides a public service  for a lot of our riders.” 
As anyone who follows urban mobility 
will tell you, e-scooters arrived on the scene about five years ago. 
They have weathered the rapid head-turning — and often criticism — from 
everyone from city officials to residents, who have both embraced and 
balked at these new mobility gadgets. Since then, regulations have been 
put in place, data sharing has been established, and most importantly, 
partnerships have taken root among scooter operators and other mobility 
providers like ride-hailing and transit. 
It is this evolution 
that most excites industry watchers like Chhabra, who pointed to the 
merging of micromobility with transit in a number of European cities as 
the kind of trend we could — and should — see in the U.S. 
“And 
so, there is this realization at some point, that you are actually 
growing the size of the pie by facilitating these introductions,” said 
Chhabra. 
To
 form those partnerships means “getting the digital right,” said 
Chhabra. But also, thinking through issues like the locations of 
mobility hubs, the placement of transit stops and the development of 
micromobility infrastructure like protected bike lanes. 
“The  places where we’ve seen the most successful programs are those where  MaaS [mobility as a service] and multimodality doesn’t exist  independently, but is part of a broader initiative to repurpose streets,  repurpose parking, away from car utilization alone,” said Chhabra. 
Merging  micromobility and transit can help regions meet some of the larger  transportation goals, particularly when thinking about sustainability or  equity, said Carlos Cruz-Casas, chief innovation officer of the  Miami-Dade County Department of Transportation and Public Works, adding  that incentivizing bikes and e-bikes could help riders travel farther  than they would on a scooter, and help to bring about other health  outcomes. 
“The more modes the better,” said Cruz-Casas, in some of his comments on the panel. 
He also noted transit agencies are taking on more modes under their operations 
“Bike-share
 started out as a private service. It’s quasi-public in many places now.
 And I can see a day when it’s much more akin to a bus service, because 
cities realize, this is actually a necessary service people are looking 
to us to provide,” he added. 
Other cities like Denver have taken a
 slightly different approach to encourage the use of micromobility. The 
city and county government recently launched a program to provide cash 
rebates for residents buying an e-bike or e-cargo bike. After only three
 weeks the city limited the program when it reached capacity. 
“The
 program has reached the maximum number of rebates that funding with 
allow,” Winna MacLaren, manager of communications and engagement in the 
Office of Climate Action, Sustainability and Resiliency in the city and 
county of Denver told Government Technology. The office will monitor how
 many of the vouchers are redeemed, and will “resume the program once we
 know how much funding remains after the initial rebate redemption 
period ends. 
“We
 do not anticipate all of the rebates that were issued in the first 
three weeks of the program will be redeemed. We also do have funding for
 a full second and third year of the program,” MacLaren added. 
The  vouchers provided $400 for an e-bike, or $900 toward the purchase of an  electric cargo bike. The rebates were higher for residents qualifying  as low income. Consequently, some 40 percent of the applicants were  “income-qualified,” said MacLaren.

There are many data sets available to fleet managers, so implementing some best practices will help you maximize the functionality of your telematics systems and engage in useful data management.
Telematics can provide incredible insights to fleet managers about the productivity and safety of their drivers and fleet.
Furthermore, telematics systems that incorporate machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) can even help fleet managers predict potential issues to make impactful business decisions.
Here are some dos and don’ts of telematics to help fleet managers stay on the right track.
DO
Implement a driver coaching systemThe data gathered from telematics systems illustrates certain modifications that could improve driver behavior. Implementing these modifications will result in a reduction of losses and increased safety on the roads.
A driver coaching program is both a written and verbal safety policy that clearly states driver expectations and performance. Encourage consistent communication with employees and establish a system for employees to provide feedback, address concerns or get their questions answered in a swift and easy manner.
Master the system you’re usingThe best way to get the most out of your telematics system is to take the time to learn it.
You may uncover beneficial use-cases for your particular industry that you may not have without knowing the full capabilities. Lean on your telematics provider’s training resources.
They should have an extensive learning/help center and provide role-based training sessions and courses so that your drivers and admins only need to learn what matters to their day-to-day use of the platform.
These courses can be offered live online or recorded for on-demand use. Take the time to learn your telematics program and about the various metrics you can measure and leverage.
Clearly define and communicate the key metrics that you want to trackPay attention to details but avoid obsessing over each tiny data point.
Telematics can provide fleet managers with a great deal of data, so it’s imperative to have goals and an overall operational plan. This could include benchmarks in driver productivity and efficiency, safety, fleet maintenance and any other business-related goals.
By spotlighting data that makes sense for your relevant objectives, it will allow you to adjust and make decisions that move the needle in a meaningful way for your set criteria.
Further to this point, be intentional with your internal communication plan and be transparent in sharing with employees which key performance indicators will be measured when they are hired. Have managers and team leads set clear expectations upfront regarding productivity and safety.
Fleet managers can garner driver buy-in for safety coaching programs and performance feedback reviews by consistently communicating with employees and establishing an efficient and easy system for employees to provide feedback, address concerns and have questions answered.
Another communication approach would be to start small and only focus on the most impactful metrics at first. Initially tracking only important data points— such as idling rates, delivery times and basic driving behaviors — can prevent drivers from feeling overwhelmed and heavily monitored when adopting a new telematics system, and fleet managers can always expand upon the initial list of tracked metrics as time goes on.
DON’T
Rely on telematics as the only way to evaluate employees and identify bad driversYes, it is important to carefully analyze the collected data, but do not use this as the sole form of driver evaluation. This could lead to distrust between managers and employees.
There may have been extenuating circumstances, such as traffic delays or road accidents, that caused a reduction in driver efficiency, so make sure to review the entire situation before labeling someone as a bad driver.
As discussed in the “dos,” a holistic approach to employee evaluation is rooted in open communication. By having conversations with customers, coworkers and – most importantly – the driver in question, you will gain a more accurate representation of an employee’s performance.
Be hard on employees when adopting your telematics softwareIt is natural for employees to be resistant or feel overwhelmed when a company implements new technologies.
Do not expect employees to embrace the system immediately. Give them time to feel it out, which will in time improve their overall performance. You also do not want to hide any information from employees. Instead, implement a user-friendly system and capitalize on transparency with employees. Hiding important information or eluding arduous questions will not lead to desired driver results.
Wait for the end of month/week reporting to take corrective actionsTraditional driver safety coaching programs are based on reports that are captured and produced on a weekly/monthly basis.
This useful information can be used in a reactive manner, but newer systems can offer feedback in real-time that is customized to your requirements. By setting up custom alerts in your telematics system, you can be notified in real-time when issues arise and take action before the problem persists long enough to be increasingly harmful to your bottom line.
Telematics has a lot to offer fleet managers and following best practices will help get the most out of the systems.
From driver coaching and safety programs to productivity tracking to business benchmarks, telematics can provide insights into almost every area of fleet management. Smart data management and application will help fleet managers maximize the functionality of their systems.
By following the dos and avoiding the don’ts, telematics will drive fleet managers to success.

Charging infrastructure can take up to 2 years to install
By Brian Straight  
Supply  chain issues may be pushing back deliveries of electric vehicles, but  that doesn’t mean last-mile delivery fleets looking to adopt can sit  back and wait.
“Fleets may think they have plenty of time … but 
sometimes it will take one to two years for the infrastructure upgrades 
from the utility,” explained Greg Hintler, U.S. managing director for The Mobility House,
 an EV charging infrastructure company. “If you want to have electric 
vehicles in two years, you should have already started or need to be 
getting started now.”
Hintler said he has heard from several 
companies that were promised EV delivery vans this year, but suppliers 
are pushing back those delivery timelines as much as two years.
“What
 we’ve heard from fleets, what we’ve heard from OEMs is there are 
massive supply chain challenges and what that translates to is very few 
vehicles being delivered at the moment,” he said. “A lot of fleets are 
hearing deliveries are being pushed to the end of the year, and the 
reality is it will be 2023.”
The Mobility House focuses on 
building out charging infrastructure. Among its clients are the Austrian
 Postal Service and the Irish Postal Service. Hintler said its customer 
base now crosses 800 fleets in the U.S. and Europe.
“Because we 
are playing both in the United States and Europe, we can … get a preview
 of what’s to come,” he said while speaking to Modern Shipper from 
Germany. “Here in Europe, they are so far ahead compared to what we are 
seeing in the U.S. However, we have commitments now from the major 
players. We know it is going to come in the U.S. and come quickly. There
 is a ton of demand. Demand isn’t the issue, it’s on the supply chain.”
Delays
 are being caused by many of the same issues affecting traditional 
automotive lines — semiconductors — as well as port congestion. In 
addition, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has strained steel supplies 
globally, with about one-third of European steel coming from plants in 
Ukraine.
“On top of that, the enormous uptake in demand, whether 
it is because of government regulation or corporate [goals] … has become
 a global challenge and all the suppliers are trying to allocate the 
little product they can get pretty evenly,” he said.
Power needs are not a major concern
One
 of the big questions around the deployment of electric vehicles is the 
strain they could place on the existing electric grid. Hintler said 
companies like The Mobility House are working with all stakeholders to 
ensure power needs are met.
“There have been many studies that 
show the generation — the amount of electricity needed — is not the 
issue, it’s the demand,” he said. “What’s important is that the 
infrastructure is built intelligently … to dampen that effect from 
electric vehicles on the grid.”
Hintler pointed to smart charging systems and managing charging time as potential solutions.
“How
 can we charge during times when there is a lot of renewable [energy] 
generation and how can we reduce the charging at times when there are 
extra stresses on the grid?” he asked. “If you control [the generation],
 those electric vehicles will be part of the solution and part of the 
future of the electric grid.”
The last-mile race
There
 are a number of vehicle makers looking to gain leverage in the 
last-mile delivery space. GM-backed BrightDrop, Amazon-funded Rivian, 
Ford and a host of other smaller firms are all battling for pieces of 
the global electric delivery van market.
With expected growth of 17% annually
 until 2030, the EV market is poised for a massive breakthrough in the 
years to come. Hintler said last-mile delivery firms are waiting, but 
some challenges remain.
“Pretty much everyone knows that electric 
is going to be the future, and most players, especially in the last-mile
 delivery and the fleet space, know that whoever figures out how to 
deploy electric vehicles at scale first will have a massive competitive 
advantage,” he said. “So there is a true race on the ground that 

 what is taking place in the media.
“What is not being 
discussed but we hear about is the challenges,” Hintler added, pointing 
to the complexity of current systems and the complexity of working with 
utilities among them. “The industry is still nascent and learning a 
lot.”
Among the complexities is the fact that not only is one 
industry being disrupted, but EVs are trying to disrupt two global 
industries at once.
“This is going to be the biggest teamwork and 
team task challenge of our generation,” Hintler said. “This is a massive
 transition, not within one industry but two industries. We not only are
 transitioning the automotive industry, we are transitioning the 
electric industry.”
OEMs challenged
Rivian
 has faced recent skepticism on its ability to ultimately deliver on the
 100,000 EV order from Amazon. The company has faced a series of 
problems, including the ability to get semiconductors. According to a 
recent Forbes article, the company cut its 2022 production target in half to 25,000 vehicles and expects an operating loss.
BrightDrop,
 which has orders for tens of thousands of its electric vans from 
companies such as FedEx, Verizon and Walmart, may be better situated to 
thrive as semiconductors become available thanks to GM’s backing. The 
same goes for Ford, although Hintler said he asked a customer about an 
expected delivery of hundreds of Ford E-Transit vans and the customer 
had only received three so far.
“They were hearing the end of the year,” he said.
The big advice Hintler wanted to impart on fleets looking to adopt was to seek out technologies that are neutral.
“In  a nascent market where you don’t know which players are going to be  around for long or which companies are going to succeed, you want to be  sure you use interoperability solutions, both on the hardware side and  the [technology] side,” he said, noting that more suppliers are  delivering common component options. “There is definitely a drive toward  interoperability as a whole, but still some players are propagating  proprietary systems.”

The e-hailing industry is expected to develop at a CAGR between 15 to 28 per cent, resulting in an increased market size of $285bn by 2030
By NICHOLAS WATSONMAY
If there’s one thing everyone agrees on in the aftermath of the pandemic, it’s that mobility as we know it has irrevocably changed. The transportation industry had already been disrupted by technology before 2020, with ride-hailing apps allowing commuters to have more control over their movements.
However, the pandemic transformed that experience into one of necessity and convenience. Add in the fact that, close to 20 per cent of the global workforce was told to work from home for the foreseeable future in the early months of the pandemic – the overall impact on the transportation sector cannot be understated.
According to a report published by Arthur D. Little in 2020, the lockdown reduced overall mobility demand in the US by up to 90 per cent, with 40-70 per cent reductions persisting during the recovery period. As people attempt to preserve social distance during journeys, this has been accompanied by increased personal mobility (cycling, walking, vehicles).
Before the pandemic, urban mobility demand was expected to expand exponentially, with urbanisation continuing and global demand for passenger mobility in urbanised regions expected to double by 2050 compared to 2010. Research indicates the pandemic had little effect on this growth tendency since the city population continued to expand faster than the overall growth of the global population.
That’s where mobility on demand (MoD) and mobility as a service comes into the spotlight. MoD is a new way of travelling that combines several easily accessible means of transportation to make an individual’s journeys more efficient. MoD is entirely based on technology, enabling people to be better informed of available options and make them more productive with their time.
Private firms, public entities, startups, and mobile apps such as ride-hailing apps and car-share providers, which cut out the middlemen and use independent contractors, provide solutions that facilitate MoD today. MoD dispels the myth that the only efficient way to travel anywhere – whether locally or internationally – is to own a vehicle or pay large sums to rent. The ownership trend is quickly giving way to usership or partnership. With a growing number of environmentally concerned young people entering the workforce and a high reliance on digital assets, MoD provides them the satisfaction of reducing their carbon footprint.
The sharing economy is all about fractionalisation and digitalisation of assets or services. Every sector is undergoinga digital transformation and re-thinking business and revenue models to engage with more customers regularly. With cars, particularly in the context of car sharing, an ‘illiquid asset’, that is, one that is ordinarily only available to one person is fractionalised through digitalisation into a car that is measured and priced by minute or meter and may be driven by anyone with a license.
Additionally, with ride-hailing industries, the expense or requirement of a license is removed because the customer receives the added benefit of a driver for the customer, allowing for even more micro-mobility access. According to another report by Arthur D. Little, the e-hailing industry is expected to develop at a CAGR between 15 to 28 per cent, resulting in an increased market size of $285bn by 2030. Primary drivers of this growth will be the lower rate of car ownership among millennials and the expected progressive integration of ride-hailing into other solutions, which include car sharing and bike sharing.
In a McKinsey survey of the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and China, it was discovered that key factors related to health and hygiene changed how private and business trips were now chosen. The cost of a trip was no longer as important as staying safe from health hazards. While the world shifts from CAPEX to OPEX and from ownership to usership, the ‘Netflix’ generation in the GCC is more interested in consumption than long-term acquisition. As automobiles become fully autonomous, car sharing, and ride-hailing will merge. Car sharing providers are already developing products to prepare for this, giving them more opportunities to scale horizontally and vertically while also providing an already experienced customer with more options. This will significantly influence the GCC, where young people who want to live aspirational lives are already establishing themselves.
Before the sharing economy, people were unable to engage due to the lack of infrastructure, and the high cost of current modes of transportation. A trip from Deira to Expo 2020 used to cost a minimum of Dhs120, but now only costs Dhs40, thanks to car sharing. And yet, there is still a long way to go.
In the UAE, the car-sharing to passenger car market has a penetration rate of 0.05 per cent. This is a twelve-fold decrease from Tallinn’s (in Estonia) 0.64 per cent and Moscow’s 0.87 per cent. Nonetheless, the UAE is seen as a more digitally savvy populace with higher internet penetration than most countries. The UAE has approximately 1,000 car-sharing cars today, while Moscow has 36,000. According to research conducted by car-sharing companies, the short-term potential is roughly 8,000 vehicles, with a long-term prospect of over 30,000 vehicles over the next five years.
The potential of the mobility market is enormous. The key to growth is an ecosystem approach and technology enablement. Only a business model based on partnerships and scalability can achieve sustainable development. People were previously unable to make trips that could not be completed by walking or cycling due to a lack of a practical mobility alternative. According to European statistics, one car-sharing vehicle replaces 17 cars that would otherwise take up parking spots, waste fuel, and emit carbon.
Finally, technology can help stream-line an experience, changing the dynamics of the business model and revenue/cost streams in the process. The question to consider for newcomers to the market is whether they can generate a million dollars from a million customers or ten customers? Which route is the best option if they can do this with ease and with an excellent interface? One option has a lower risk of losing a customer, but the other has a higher revenue loss. The challenge then is to build a service or platform that can appeal to customers across the market while providing five-star services for everyone.

Ever since the SF Park smart parking system of San Francisco was introduced in 2011, constant improvements have been made and milestones achieved. For instance, the SF Park system automatically adjusts the parking meter rates based on the traffic flow. Since the system was implemented to distribute parking evenly, the hourly rates rise or fall to fill up or empty parking spaces, keeping in mind the traffic conditions on the streets. But, how bad was the traffic issue for San Francisco’s motorists that the city needed such a radical change and how has such change progressed? Let us find out how San Francisco reduced traffic with Smart Parking.
San Francisco: Top Contestant for Traffic Congestions
Though San Francisco did not score the worst in terms of traffic congestion, the city was notorious as one of the top contestants for traffic issues. And the leading cause for such woes was cruising – motorists circling the streets in search of a vacant parking spot. Some drivers spent an excessive amount of time cruising behind the wheel. All their hope rested on chance – the area where they’re headed and whether or not it is the rush hour.
For instance – Areas such as the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge were choke points and as such, remained overcrowded for most part of the day. However, the worse congestion time was the morning hours, precisely around 8:00 AM. On average, Thursdays scored worse than any other day of the week.
Moreover, the gridlock, mainly during peak hours, branched from the root of the issue – finding an available parking spot. The busy downtown and Chinatown were inconveniently crowded to the extent that drivers were compelled to opt for metered or garage parking as finding a street parking spot was like spotting a unicorn. So, how San Francisco reduced traffic with Smart Parking?
Smart Parking: Making Life Easier for Drivers
Now, finding a vacant parking spot in San Francisco may be a real adventure, but that’s not the kind of adventure most of us like to embark on. With the emergence, trial-and-error efforts, and official usage of smart parking technology, the city’s drivers are experiencing a much-needed respite from their daily traffic struggles.
By displaying available parking spots via smart applications and guiding a driver to the exact location of the desired spot, the smart parking system – SF Park – has not only dealt with the city’s motorists’ worst nightmare but has also streamlined the traffic flow. Vehicle miles have definitely decreased as drivers can spot an available parking spot with ease. Also, local sales tax revenue has increased, indicating that people spent lesser time cruising around and more on their businesses.
Having said that, it is also true that the exact impact of the city’s SF Park system cannot be quantified as of now. This does not mean bad news. It merely means that there is room for improvement – the system’s efficiency and performance is as realistic as it can get. By and by, as advancements in smart parking technology take place (and they are taking place), the system will naturally become smarter and more efficient.
Does the Future Look Even Brighter?
As of now, the one area that especially needs improvement is the availability of a guaranteed parking space every single time. So, what can drivers do until the issue is dealt with? The best approach would be to reserve a monthly parking SF. These credentials allow drivers to enter and exit the facility freely without worrying about the availability of a parking space. This feature is especially useful for those working downtown or visiting downtown on a regular basis.
Moving on to the future; San Francisco’s SF Park is bound to get better as constant improvements are being made to IoT or the Internet of Things – the technology behind Smart Parking. Once the problem of guaranteed availability has been solved, motorists will already know the total number of available parking spots even before they enter the lot. This will be displayed via smart apps. At that ideal time, neither will there be any traffic congestions, nor loss of fuel and money and no unwanted carbon emissions into the environment.
Place the word “smart” in front of any noun, and you can instantly have something that somehow sounds improved. However, smart parking’s current achievements do not cancel the fact that there is a learning curve and a long way to go before the vision of a cruise-free San Francisco can be realized. However, when that happens, all worries and fears with regards to missing commitments or arriving late for a corporate meeting will become a distant memory.

The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) has seen a significant spike in transit ridership in recent months, and even more so in recent weeks as gas prices continue to ride. 
“MTS was budgeting for an 11 percent increase in ridership over last fiscal year. Our new estimates show ridership will jump 45 percent over the previous year,” said Sharon Cooney, MTS CEO. “We still have room to grow to get back to pre-pandemic levels, but these are great indicators. This sustained growth coupled with recent ridership spikes prove that people are motivated to save money, and still know that transit is a safe and affordable way to get around.” 
MTS has developed a dedicated webpage with a commute calculator for those interested in learning about the cost of driving alone vs. taking transit. The calculator factors in information such as commuting miles, estimated miles per gallon, parking costs, number of days commuting and price per gallon of fuel. The agency has also launched digital advertisements to educate commuters about the costs of driving vs. taking transit.  
Preliminary ridership estimates from last week show: 
Ridership was up to nearly 200,000 trips per weekday (197,000) for the week of March 7-11, which is approximately 70 percent of the pre-COVID-19 baseline.  This is the highest ridership has been since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trolley ridership has grown to more than 80 percent of pre-pandemic level. On Wednesday, March 9, ridership jumped 102 percent systemwide vs. the same day in 2021 There was a 111 percent ridership increase on trolleys. There was a 94 percent ridership increase on buses. 
Additionally, year-over-year comparison by month shows that ridership has consistently been significantly higher compared to last year. Even during the height of the Omicron surge in January, MTS transit ridership showed consistent improvement over 2021. In February, MTS hit its highest monthly increase in ridership over the same month last year. 
Another positive development for transit is that the UC San Diego Blue Line is performing well since the 11-mile extension to UTC opened in November 2021. The Blue Line is now averaging nearly 60,000 trips per weekday since the start of February. This is approximately a 33 percent ridership increase since the extension opened on Nov. 21.

By Shubhankar GautamTime loss due to traffic jams, rising levels of environmental pollution, an increasing number of fatalities, some of the many woes of urban commuting. Enter smart mobility, a solution based on the use of different modes of transportation instead of one’s personal vehicle. This concept, which runs on the use of carpooling, ridesharing, and bike commuting, has taken cities by storm. Not only that, this market is expected to grow further still though things have been going a little downhill since the advent of the pandemic.
Impact of COVID-19 on the Smart Mobility Market: An Analysis
2020 has been a grim year for all industrial sectors, especially the smart mobility market. The primary reason for the downfall of the smart mobility market can be attributed to a decline in demand for carpooling and ridesharing services across the world, owing to safety concerns.
While it is true that the market is expected to experience even slower growth during 2021, industry experts expect to see the curve rising from the year 2022 onwards. This forecast is based on the belief that adequate safety measures will be introduced for carpooling and ridesharing, such as the placement of plastic barriers between the car’s driver and its passengers.
Factors Affecting the Growth of Smart Mobility
The application of electricity to transportation and the use of carpooling are not novel concepts. In fact, the first Electric Vehicle (EV) was introduced in the US as early as 1889, and by the early 1900s, nearly one-third of the vehicles on the American streets were electricity-powered. It was not until the 1930s that cheap Texas oil made EVs a thing of the past. However, here we stand at the cusp of another golden age wherein EVs and smart mobility are bound to become an essential part of the future.
Having said that, it is natural for one to ask about the significant factors influencing the smart mobility market. The factors may either be drivers or barriers that need to be dealt with the innovation and a common purpose to turn the idea of smart mobility into a living reality.
#1 The Way People Viewed Vehicles are Changing
It was only a few decades back that owning a private car was every family’s dream. Mass production of automobiles and budget-friendly fuel prices brought this ideal within the reach of the average citizen, and as a result, vehicle-centric urban design and personal, door-to-door transportation became the norm.
Today, the scenario is much different. The present millennial-led era prefers not to own a car; instead, this young generation of commuters is shifting in favor of ridesharing services such as Uber or Lyft – they prefer to subscribe to a car-sharing service rather than bear the cost of a personal car, which includes fuel and maintenance costs. Is it any surprise that such new vehicle usage patterns will encourage the growth of the smart mobility market?
#2 Technology is Advancing at a Lightning-Fast Pace
From autonomous vehicles that are smart enough to run on their own to smart parking systems that make the tedious task of parking a piece of cake, technology is the key driver of the smart mobility market. The hyper-connectivity offered by the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G will make it easier for cities to manage traffic, cut down environmental pollution, and make better use of infrastructure. Commuters can have real-time information for smoother and safer transit.
Then, with the use of self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles and drone deliveries, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) predicts that the world may see a whopping 90% reduction in traffic deaths, a 40% reduction in travel time, and a 500% increase in lane capacity. Does it get any smarter than this!
#3 Low Rate of Internet Penetration in Developing Regions
Here’s a barrier to entry for smart mobility systems in full force. Now, the use of ridesharing services requires the involvement of three parties, namely the rider, the driver, and the service provider. The entire process of matching riders with drivers, fare estimation and ride payment are to be carried out via smartphone apps, which in turn require good internet connectivity. 
Unfortunately, some regions, such as Burundi, Chad, and Somalia, among others, have extremely low internet penetration that hinders the development of smart mobility systems in such countries. Once the proper infrastructure for connectivity has been established, the dream of smart mobility can proceed onwards.
#4 An Entirely New Infrastructure and Value Chain is Needed
As much as IoT requires proper infrastructure for connectivity, so does the use of Electric Vehicles require ubiquitous charging infrastructure. The current scenario is pretty awkward wherein potential EV drivers do not see an infrastructure that allows them to buy an EV and drive with confidence, and on the other hand, potential infrastructure providers do not see mass demand insight. Until the time charging stations become as common as gas stations are today, this one barrier-to-entry will make the adoption of EVs a far-fetched dream.
#5 Another Major Driver is Government Policies
Central, state, and city governments can join hands to speed up the adoption of smart mobility systems. Although several US state governments have already directed their focus towards measures such as tax credits and rebates to make smart mobility more affordable for early adopters and are also imposing strict vehicle emission standards for automobile manufacturers, the need of the hour is to offer exclusive EV parking in congested areas, and establishment of ZEZs or Zero Emission Zones wherein traffic will be restricted to bikes, pedestrians, delivery vehicles, and electric vehicles – measures already in place by the city governments of London, Brussels, Paris, and Madrid. Such government policies are sure to accelerate the growth of the smart mobility market.
Top Companies Expected to Dominate the Smart Mobility Market
To create technologically evolved smart mobility solutions, companies need to come up with products that are developed from a long-term market perspective as opposed to short-term creations. This is because as the smart mobility market is set in stone and matures, consumers will naturally demand integrated solutions – a mix of travel services with ancillary services.
As of now, the following companies are expected to take the lead in the future smart mobility market –
CiscoMaaS Global OySiemensTomTom InternationalInnoviz Technologies Inc.Toyota Motor CorporationFord Motor Company, among others.
Despite its present sluggish growth, smart mobility will be a factor in customer preference, changing the way people travel. It’s only a matter of time before this service model comes to the mainstream, and come it will, reaching its projected growth of $70.46 billion by the year 2027.

The  car-sharing venture formed by BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz AG will be owned  by Stellantis. The move comes along as the automakers struggle to make  the business profitable. All the automakers involved in the deal did not  disclose any price details. Currently, the business has around 3.4  million customers across 16 European cities.
With this move, Stellantis aims to have new streams of revenue as it shifts to electric vehicles. Also, for BMW
 and Mercedes, this move is another step in reshaping mobility 
offerings. Back in 2018, the automakers combined and started the 
services to compete with providers like Uber to save costs. Now, the 
challenges to making the services profitable without the requisite scale
 continue. So they decided to sell the business, according to Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, Stellantis has increased its presence effectively since 
its formation. It has been working on getting younger buyers to try its 
brand and keeping up with changing mobility needs. The share Now 
service, currently available in European countries, was added to 
long-term rental options. Various models like Minis and Mercedes-Benz A-Class were made available for rentals through apps. However, there have been struggles to make it profitable.
Estimates
While the companies didn’t disclose the price, Juergen Pieper, an 
analyst at Bankhaus Metzler, said it would likely be below 500 million 
euros ($525 million), and perhaps around 250 million euros. Pieper 
estimates Share Now has lost around 200 million euros annually, the 
analyst said via email. “Maybe Stellantis with its low financial 
investment and a leaner cost structure can make more out of it,” Pieper 
said. Volkswagen AG, Stellantis’ biggest European rival, is closing in 
on the acquisition of Europcar as part of a broader push to create a 
sprawling mobility services platform. A consortium led by the German 
industrial giant expects the deal to be completed before the end of the 
second quarter.
Free2Move has around 2 million customers for its app-based parking,  leasing, and rental services. Share Now provides so-called free-floating  car-sharing services in 16 European cities and has around 3.4 million  customers.  Over the next decade, Stellantis intends to expand  Free2move’s presence worldwide, growing it to 15 million active users  and achieving net revenues of 2.8 billion euros. The acquisition comes a  little over a year after the mega-merger between Fiat Chrysler and PSA  Group to form a sprawling manufacturer across 14 brands with nameplates  like Jeep, Ram, and Fiat to add scale to the shift toward electric  vehicles and autonomous driving.

Living with the pressure of delivering reliable, on-demand transportation to riders in a 700-square-mile service area with just two vehicles may seem like a tall order, but for the past year it’s simply been business as usual for the operations team at Battle Creek Transit.
In March of 2021, Battle Creek Transit received funding through a Michigan Department of Transportation grant to launch the Calhoun County Coordinated Mobility Pilot – or as it came to be known to residents in the community: BCGo.
Today, BCGo provides door-to-door microtransit service across all of Calhoun County, including in the cities of Battle Creek, Marshall and Albion. As they approach the service’s one-year anniversary, it’s fair to say that not only has BCGo demonstrated the feasibility of an on-demand microtransit service in the county, but it’s also made an important impact on the community members that regularly use the service.
‘The demand far exceeded anyone’s expectations’
Residents of Calhoun County who don’t own or have regular access to a vehicle have faced a rough road in the past couple of years when it comes to finding reliable mobility options that meet their daily needs. Straightforward tasks such as commuting to a job interview, meeting up with friends or simply trying to get to the grocery store suddenly become much more stressful when faced with limited transportation options.
“We have always known that there was demand for this kind of service, especially in the rural areas of the county, but BCGo has allowed us to prove that the demand far exceeded what anyone’s expectations were and has provided us the opportunity to engage with the community like never before,” said Mallory Avis, public transit director, city of Battle Creek.
In March of 2020, one year prior to BCGo’s launch, a Calhoun County Transit Survey uncovered that these types of challenges were an everyday reality for many citizens of Calhoun County. The study painted a picture of a community in critical need of alternative mobility options. It found that Calhoun County was home to more senior citizens and people living with disabilities than the national average. At the same time, a higher-than-average percentage of the county’s population was living under 150 percent of the poverty line and a lower-than-average percentage of households had regular access to more than one car.
To make matters worse, in September of 2019 a reliable private cab company that had operated for decades in Battle Creek, the largest city in the county, had to close its doors for good.
All told, the Calhoun County Transit Survey estimated that the county faced an annual shortfall of more than 20,000 available trips relative to demand. One year later, the BCGo service hit the road for the first time to help residents of Calhoun County safely and reliably navigate through their community.
Building the platform
To help power the new microtransit service, the team at Battle Creek Transit turned to shared mobility provider Liftango to build the Demand-Responsive Transit platform that would allow users to book trips straight from their phones using the BCGo App (iOS and Android.)
This technology platform dynamically routes BCGo’s two vehicles throughout the service area based on real-time passenger demand so that they can maximize ridership and minimize wasted miles. Passengers that want to book their trip in advance get a truly guaranteed, pre-booked ride thanks to Liftango’s advanced matching algorithm.
“The experts will tell you that a county-wide microtransit service supported by a small fleet of vehicles will fail. The combination of Battle Creek Transit’s understanding of their community and Liftango’s unique matching approach has enabled a service that is efficient and hugely valued by the community. BCGo stands out as a true illustration of the power of demand responsive transport; something counties across the U.S. could look to replicate,” said Liftango Vice President Americas Jacob Greig.
BCGo customers can book rides up to 14 days in advance and as close to 30 minutes prior to the desired departure time. To deliver guaranteed, pre-booked rides, the BCGo app provides riders with different matching options that account for other requests already placed in the system, vehicle availability, the user’s schedule and a host of other variables. This allows commuters to access truly on-demand transport around their schedule without worrying that the ride they were depending on may not be matched in the system.
Riders without access to a smartphone or mobile device can call Battle Creek Transit Dispatch where the operations center enters their desired pick-up and drop-off times and uses the same booking system to find them the best available ride.
Measuring the impact
Since the launch of the BCGo pilot on March 8, 2021, the response and demand in the community has been overwhelming. In fact, the service’s only limitation appears to be that they simply do not have enough vehicles or staff members to keep up with the county’s demand for their service.
In the second month of operation, the service’s two vehicles were already completing dozens of trips every day. From its launch in March of 2021 through the end of the year, the service booked nearly 7,000 trips and averaged a daily ridership of close to 30 passengers.
Retention rates have also been remarkably high for the entire duration of the pilot phase. For example, from June of 2021, BCGo’s third full month of operation, through the end of December, reporting data shows that an average of 68 percent of riders each month were returning users. Many riders have come to depend on BCGo as a primary mode of transportation and this level of loyalty can be attributed in part to the fact that the service is reliable, punctual and affordable. The service is early or on time with 82 percent of pickups and 85 percent of drop-offs and ride fares are calculated dynamically based on trip mileage.
The service is also accessible to riders with special mobility assistance needs, including passengers in wheelchairs, those with portable oxygen tanks or other medical devices. The BCGo mobile application allows mobility-assisted riders to alert their driver ahead of time and automatically accounts for space requirements when completing passenger bookings. BCGo vehicles completed, on average, more than 25 mobility-assisted trips each month from March of 2021 through the end of December.
‘Expanding access to education, employment, healthcare and social activities’
Regular BCGo riders have been enthusiastic about sharing their support of the program and the impact it’s had on their lives. Community members regularly use BCGo to see friends and family members that they had been separated from for months, or even years, due to lack of reliable transportation options.
Here is what two users had to say about their experience with the BCGo service:
“I want to tell you how impressed I am with BCGo, I give your service five stars. All your drivers and dispatchers are so friendly and personable. I’m thrilled with this new service. Keep up the good work.”
“Used this service for my mother for the first time today. I have nothing but positive things to say. Prompt service plus very nice and polite employees. Affordable service. This service helped get my mom out and about after a year and a half. So thankful.”
BCGo has proved to be a successful example of how technology can completely change the way public transportation operates. The Coordinated Mobility Pilot has allowed Battle Creek Transit to demonstrate the feasibility of on-demand transportation in rural and suburban areas with a lower population density than most other service zones.
“BCGo has allowed us to better meet the needs of Calhoun County, expanding access to education, employment, healthcare, and social activities. Getting to know our customers and their stories plays a key role in the success of our pilot and the transportation services we aim to provide in the future,” said Battle Creek Transit Mobility Manager Kristy Grestini.
BCGo has changed the perception of and increased the adoption of public transportation for Calhoun County. The combination of vehicle design, technology and customer service has elevated the expectations of public transit and has allowed Battle Creek Transit and other area providers to use this energy and the data collected to advance conversations regarding transit funding and service expansions.

In smart city projects,
 IoT is a key enabler, and a number of other technologies and 
applications must be used to make smart city projects a reality. Smart 
cities are becoming increasingly popular. However, there is much more to
 smart cities development than just putting together a website and 
hoping it will take off. The ability to respond in an instant is an 
important factor that has led to a shift in city formation. To develop 
smart city technology, cities must have access to information on 
sustainability, resilience, and artificial intelligence to successfully 
analyze data and improve city life.
Besides, sustainable smart 
cities also help improve infrastructure. These systems can monitor air 
quality and waste management, which is already proven in the examples of
 such cities as Singapore, Zurich, and Oslo.To
 develop smart city technology, cities must have access to information 
on sustainability, resilience, and artificial intelligence to 
successfully analyze data and improve city life.Click To Tweet
What is a Smart City?
A smart city is a technologically advanced urban area.
 Generally, it is a digitalized version of a physical city. It is one of
 the newest forms of technology as it uses different kinds of electronic
 methods to collect data. It integrates all the different layers of a 
city’s infrastructure.
This includes sensors to detect people 
walking by the street, sensors to detect when it is dark outside our 
other sensors that might be necessary for effective technological 
performance around the city. For example, a light-detecting sensor 
enables a city to turn on the streetlights automatically when necessary.
 This technology is used by governments to make decisions regarding 
transportation and climate.
The concept of a smart city involves 
bringing together a number of fields of knowledge. It includes public 
administration and e-government. The latest developments in this field 
have made it possible for cities to create and deploy their own 
intelligent systems. Developing a sustainable smart city is an important
 part of a city’s development, so the concept of a sustainable smart 
city must be embraced.
IoT Solutions Role in Smart Cities Development
Internet
 of Things (IoT) solutions have played a key role in the development of 
sustainable smart cities. They help in reducing power consumption and 
costs, as well as play a significant role in preventing crime. They can 
be deployed in public places to provide real-time monitoring, analytics,
 and decision-making tools. This can also be used to track and predict 
crime scenes.
The IoT network allows cities to track and improve 
the safety of public transportation. The use of IoT sensors in public 
transport systems can provide a wealth of data about the journey of a 
passenger. With this information, smart public transportation operators 
can improve the traveling experience.
There are many advantages of
 using IoT in a smart infrastructure. For example, it can provide 
enhanced security and convenience. It can also be used to improve 
efficiency in data collection and management. The IoT in a city is the 
way to increase the quality of the urban lifestyle.
How do IoT Technologies Build Smart Cities?
IoT
 smart city solutions can be widely used in city infrastructure. For 
instance, smart fire sensors can alert citizens of fire and coordinate 
rescue robots, which will significantly improve the safety of city 
residents. Other IoT applications are also eco-friendly and 
power-efficient.
They can also monitor speed limits and other 
factors that affect the quality of life. And because IoT solutions use 
advanced sensors, they can also help develop sustainable commerce 
models. This makes it easier for cities to build smarter infrastructure 
and services.
Best Smart Cities Using IoT Devices
Currently,
 there are more and more sustainable smart cities emerging in the world.
 They focus on the optimization of air quality monitoring, renewable 
energy, green energy systems, optimization of traffic flow, waste 
management companies, and other sustainable smart solutions in urban 
areas. Cities can realize a lot of innovative infrastructure ideas using
 IoT, that is why IoT technologies are of great importance.
Singapore
In
 recent years, Singapore has sought to become one of the world’s first 
official sustainable smart cities to harness the power of the Internet 
of Things. With one of the oldest populations in Asia, Singapore is 
addressing senior living conditions in order to reduce the risk of 
accidents.
Increasing the number of autonomous cars on the road 
has reduced accidents and loneliness among senior citizens. The 
government has also installed surveillance cameras and widened sidewalks
 in certain areas. With these innovations, the government is taking the 
lead in making Singapore a smart city.
Singapore has many aspects 
that help make it a smarter place. Its people are more connected than 
ever, and the government is using digital technologies to promote a 
smart life. Using digital technology to improve public safety is a key 
element of this approach. A smart city enables citizens to access 
information from anywhere. Such highly advanced communication 
technologies facilitate the city’s digital infrastructure development 
and put Singapore in one line with the best IoT smart cities.
Singapore
 has a rapidly growing technology ecosystem. The land transport 
authority has recently expanded its autonomous vehicle pilot zones and 
is working to integrate active mobility with public transportation. By 
integrating a smart city with the existing transport system, people can 
live in an environment that is able to handle any situation that may 
arise. City officials want to make the city a “citizen-centric” one.
Additionally,
 Singapore’s government is highly concerned with the environmental 
situation and has already taken a lot of initiatives that push Singapore
 to the list of the world’s smartest cities. For example, Singapore has 
implemented a smart waste bin system. It is aimed at improving air 
quality and fitting the United Nations regulations on environmental 
policy.
What is more, Singapore has big plans for the future 
integration of smart city technologies. Some of the more innovative 
services are already in place. For example, the Singapore Police Force 
has a web-based electronic police center that helps citizens file police
 reports. The system also allows citizens to access information and 
other information they might need online.
Another initiative is 
the Singapore Power mobile app. It allows citizens to see their monthly 
bills and submit meter readings, and it also helps them audit their 
homes’ usage. With the help of IoT, Singapore can become a global 
leader, and with this understanding, the government allocates a lot of 
resources on realizing smart city projects.
Zurich
Zurich,
 being listed as the second smartest city is attempting to become the 
best in the world with a number of initiatives. The innovations team is 
working with the municipal government, SBB, and various electrical 
utilities in the Canton of Zurich. They are collaborating with a wide 
range of companies to make it easier for citizens to participate. With a
 lean approach, they are able to make the entire process transparent, 
which makes it a lot easier to implement.
Zurich takes a lot of 
initiatives focused on decreasing power consumption and optimizing 
digital security. Other initiatives include reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions, circular waste management, and implementing technology-based 
plans to keep the city safe and crime-free. All of these initiatives are
 possible due to the effective use of smart sensors.
Zurich 
supports innovative, responsible, and sustainable development. It seeks 
to improve public transport, increase energy efficiency, and reduce 
pollution. It also offers climate-neutral mobility. Zurich’s initiative 
is aimed at increasing the quality of life in the city.
Additionally,
 Zurich is pursuing innovative projects to overcome its challenges. The 
concept of smart cities is already a big challenge. Not only is it 
difficult to implement but it also requires a thorough understanding of 
people and society. This is why Zurich becomes a role model in the 
concept of Swiss smart cities.
Zurich has invested in fiber-optic 
networks and top-level infrastructure. In addition to this, Zurich’s 
smart streetlights can be a great example to other cities around the 
world. Such a creation of connected devices and networks will make 
Zurich more an attractive place to live in.
Sure thing, Zurich is 
not a pioneer in the smart city movement but it shows a really 
impressive development lastly. Its initiatives include the creation of 
“smart communities” that are part of larger metropolitan areas. Zurich’s
 smart communities will be able to provide the services that people 
need.
It will also allow the city to expand its public mobility in
 a resource-saving way. Zurich is planning to develop a mobility 
platform to serve its citizens and to help them navigate the city. With 
smart communities, Zurich will have safer streets and an easier way for a
 city to manage direct traffic.
Zurich’s transportation, energy, 
and water suppliers are working together to create a sustainable city. 
The city’s municipal government has taken a lead in this movement, with 
the integration of smart traffic lights, smart metering, smart grids, 
and other related projects. They are working with innovative companies 
to develop integrated solutions that not only increase efficiency and 
reduce costs but also promote a better quality of life for residents.

The
 Norwegian capital stands among the best smart cities in the world. It 
realizes a lot of smart city solutions, including solutions for urban 
traffic congestion, smart parking projects, lowering energy usage, and 
other urban planning initiatives. For example, the E-Street project in 
Oslo, Norway, is aimed at making the city’s streets more efficient and 
reducing energy consumption.
Some of these projects focus on 
building new, energy-efficient buildings, retrofitting existing 
buildings, and testing electric buses (school buses, public buses, 
etc.). In fact, the project helps the city to save over 70 percent of 
energy. The project will also introduce new technologies like solar 
panels and will include energy-efficient lamps and smart lighting.
The
 innovative technology that is being used in Oslo’s city plans is not 
limited to energy savings. The connected sensors in these streetlights 
also monitor the humidity and rain levels, enabling the city to optimize
 its waste collection operations. The city’s streets will be connected 
to digital bus stops, which will let citizens know when their bus will 
arrive. The system will also include a parking guide for smart cars.
Another
 initiative, called the Climate Dashboard, aims to help the city make an
 environmentally friendly effort. The climate dashboard will allow 
citizens to follow up on environmental initiatives’ progress. With the 
help of the Climate Dashboard, the city is taking the necessary steps to
 ensure its eco-friendly future.
Another initiative focuses on 
sustainable transportation. The region has a lot of public-private 
collaborations, and Oslo has several such partnerships. The city has a 
lot of potential for improvement. Its innovative programs include smart 
parking, automated streetlights, and bicycle rental points. Furthermore,
 it is planning to introduce a “Smart Oslo Pitch” competition that will 
encourage entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas and help improve the 
quality of life for its citizens.
The city is already working on a
 number of initiatives to make the city more inclusive. The city has 
already implemented six projects and has even made a map of its 
neighborhood. The project’s first phase focuses on making the city 
greener and more sustainable. Its six smart projects, meanwhile, aim to 
increase accessibility for residents and improve accessibility for 
businesses and the local population. These ideas will help make the city
 more accessible to all people.
What Makes Smart Cities Successful?
Organization and Planning
For
 a smart city initiative to be successful it needs to be 
well-thought-out and organized on different levels. The city of the 
future should address the issues of its residents. There are various 
issues to solve: crime, congestion, emergency fire response, waste 
management, active mobility options, police security, absence of 
essential utilities, public transportation, and low-quality housing and 
public administrations.
Given the severe rivalry for talent across
 urban areas, dissatisfied residents are probably going leave for a more
 winning environment. To succeed, city leaders should focus on the 
prosperity, sustainability, and other essential necessities of their 
inhabitants.
Community Involvement
First
 of all, identifying the community responsible for smart city 
development is a vital component of a smart city creation process. This 
will allow smart cities to secure the power of new information and 
technologies. It is important to identify the community’s attributes to 
create a smart city. What is more, it is incredibly important to study 
the social environment for effective smart systems management and 
integration.
Financial Plan
Investment
 management is another essential component of smart infrastructure 
success. The challenges are numerous, and overcoming these obstacles 
will require a systematic approach. In some cases, budget constraints 
may prevent cities from developing smart city initiatives. The city 
needs to invest in a variety of smart technologies, including AI, smart 
city applications, IoT, and smart tools as well as other smart city 
devices.
Established Regulations
In
 order to make a smart city, city officials must implement clear 
policies that improve the quality of life for their residents. To do 
this, smart cities should implement equitable policies that benefit all 
people. Small cities, particularly those in developing countries, must 
also have a public policy that protects the environment since more than 
half of them are facing problems with them.
By implementing 
innovative city services that allow effective data analysis, governments
 will be able to better serve their citizens and use collected data for 
the improvement of entire city life. By developing a sustainable 
strategy, smart cities will create new revenue streams and cut costs.
Conclusion
A
 recent report by the United Nations showed that five out of 10 people 
living in the world will sooner or later live in urban areas. Using 
these technologies, cities can improve energy consumption, energy 
distribution, and overall sustainability. Moreover, cloud-based IoT 
applications can help manage data in real-time and make quicker 
decisions. IoT can help cities automate many processes and provide 
better public safety.
A city can use IoT to monitor the  temperature of its citizens, which is crucial for a healthy and  sustainable environment. These services are the most beneficial solution  to the city environment and the residents. That is why the decision to  integrate IoT technologies into the city infrastructure is the decision  that has to be made for a better quality of life and comfort. Now it’s  time to take a step to the future of smart life.

As logistics and freight organizations become more digitized, enterprises will be able to collect increasing amounts of data surrounding their customers, supply chain, deliveries, fleet, drivers, and more. Leading logistics organizations are already harnessing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in transportation. While a lot of enterprises currently collect this data, which will only continue to increase in the future, this data is still massively underutilized. 
Route Planning with Predictive Analytics
Using the power of AI, enterprises can unlock advanced route planning that optimizes several real-world factors in a way that’s difficult or impossible for traditional route planning to do.
 AI-powered systems will enable better customer experiences, improved fleet management, and better overall business margins in the transportation sector.
Traditional route planning factors in transportation can typically only incorporate a few factors, which are still very naive rule-based factors. However, traditional ways can’t just be replaced overnight. The entire procedure of adapting to a new technology requires time and skills to be acquired.
To enable efficient route planning with AI, enterprises need to account for a wide variety of factors. Factors include the type that is to be delivered, customer preferences, traffic patterns, local road regulations, and changing routing behaviors in addition to subjective factors such as local knowledge of delivery personnel and other preferences.With predictive analytics, an AI-powered system can optimize real-world factors for route planning that results in a lower cost of deliveries, faster delivery times, reduced shipping costs, and better asset utilization. Predictive analytics use data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data. 
Benefits of Utilizing AI For Logistics and Transportation
In the future, AI-based systems will help unlock the true potential power of enterprise data. This will enable better customer experiences, improved fleet management, faster deliveries, lower safety incidents, and better overall business margins. AI enables a win-win scenario for all stakeholders in the logistics transportation ecosystem but requires some effort and investment to build and maintain. 
Recommendations For AI
As important as AI is, an underrated component of AI is data and data engineering. Data engineering is the aspect of data science that focuses on practical applications of data collection and analysis. Before jumping onto the AI hype train, ask yourself, are you collecting critical data about your business operations? Is the data effectively stored, organized, and easily accessible? 
At the end of the day, while AI is currently a trending tech buzzword, it’s only useful to solve an actual business problem. Assess what problems you want AI-based systems to solve, adopt them into your business goals, and use the proper metrics to measure efficiencies.

Creating eco-friendly last-mile delivery strategies is an important business and societal challenge. Here are some options supply chain leaders can explore.
By George Lawton
The recent UN climate report sounded an urgent alarm on global warming. With that, an important source of carbon emissions may receive more scrutiny — the last mile.
The transportation sector is one of the main causes of global carbon emission, and last-mile deliveries are solidly in that category. Greening the last mile is a critical endeavor for today’s supply chain leaders. Most importantly, creating concrete sustainability goals that include a more eco-friendly last mile is an important step in the fight against climate change. But companies with business models that prioritize sustainability can also win with customers. More sustainable last-mile delivery models can also potentially add to the bottom line through greater efficiencies and enhance a company’s brand image.
“Enough customers care about the climate now, so it begins to become a potent aspect of a brand’s identity,” said Peter Dering, CEO at Peak Designs, a camera bag company headquartered in San Francisco that has an environmental focus as its core mission, and co-founder of Climate Neutral.
Here are 10 potential ways companies can opt for more sustainable delivery methods and support a more eco-friendly last mile.
Measure your last-mile carbon footprint
Taking an inventory of your current carbon footprint can help you understand what sustainability goals your company should focus on.
Peak inventoried its footprint and found that sourcing virgin aluminum was its biggest contributor to carbon emissions. However, sourcing recycled aluminum is challenging, particularly for a small companies that use a fraction of what large companies do. So, its leaders decided to invest in stockpiling recycled aluminum far above their requirements. Although stockpiling creates costs to manage, it is cheaper than the corresponding carbon offsets, or the investments that help cancel out carbon emission generation, such as planting trees.
Focus on sustainability metrics
Discovering the pragmatic steps you can take to reduce your carbon footprint is a key aspect of a sustainability initiative. Aspects to focus on include sustainability metrics and carbon offsets, and that may require working with an organization that specializes in these areas.
Climate Neutral, a nonprofit green trade consortium, is one such organization. Its mission is for companies to become carbon-neutral as quickly as possible.Enough customers care about the climate now, so it begins to become a potent aspect of a brand’s identity.Peter DeringCEO, Peak Designs
Climate Neutral offers a carbon emission calculator to identify impact. Companies get certified by Climate Neutral through a process that involves measuring footprint and offsetting emissions.
Companies can work toward addressing past and present emissions through carbon removal efforts and avoidance credits, said Austin Whitman, CEO of Climate Neutral. This helps highlight the return on investment of aggressive investments in reduced air shipping, clean electric vehicles for ground transport and other sustainability efforts, he said.
Connect offsets to delivery
Investing in carbon offsets — such as planting trees or using solar or wind energy — can be an important move to making the last mile more eco-friendly.
Ware2Go, a UPS warehouse fulfillment company based in Atlanta, is investigating this route.
It has recently partnered with Pachama, a San Francisco-based startup that builds a technology-verified marketplace for forest carbon offsets. Pachama monitors reforestation projects using satellite imaging and AI to ensure those projects’ ability to offset emissions.
Ware2Go is working with Pachama in efforts to fund reforestation, protect old-growth forests and improve forest management, according to the company.
“All of our merchants are automatically enrolled at no cost to them, so every business that is fulfilling with Ware2Go is participating in the program,” said Patrick Cadic, chief revenue officer at Ware2Go at the time of writing.
This investment will also help Ware2Go justify investment in other sustainable delivery options and innovative solutions, he said.
Market the green delivery option
The exponential rise of online shopping has added to traffic congestion in urban centers and to carbon dioxide emissions, to name just two issues researchers have found. Choosing a fast delivery time exacerbates these problems. Fast deliveries — in particular, next-day delivery or same-day delivery options — are particularly bad for the planet, which customers may not realize.
For example, a group of researchers at MIT found that fast shipping not only increases costs by up to 68%, it also increases total carbon emissions by up to 15%.
Communicating that information and giving consumers a slower-speed choice may help decrease harmful carbon emissions.
Researchers on the “green button project” at MIT are investigating this issue in depth. Their work suggests that companies can influence shopping habits by empowering consumers with green choices.
The researchers found that environmental explanations of slower delivery worked better than merely offering financial incentives. For example, 30% of customers who didn’t opt for slower delivery merely for economic incentives said they would be willing to wait longer for home deliveries when given environmental incentives.
The most effective way to motivate customers to wait was explaining their fast delivery choices in terms of trees.
When the MIT researchers gave consumers the choice between saving a hundred trees or opting for faster shipping, 40% said they’d wait. Researchers found that using trees to explain environmental impact has the potential for companies to cut their last mile delivery carbon footprint by 25%. They also believe it has the potential to increase customer satisfaction since the concept translates environmental issues into terms that are easy to understand and gives consumers a simple way to make a pro-environmental choice.
Use zero-emission delivery fleets
Last-mile delivery has traditionally relied on fossil fuel-powered delivery vehicles — a notorious source of carbon dioxide emissions — and supply chain leaders are beginning to look for alternatives to these.
Although delivery vehicles compose only a small portion of the traffic in urban centers, they generate more than half of overall emissions for certain contaminants, according to University of California Institute of Transportation Studies researchers. The use of zero emission and near-zero emission vehicles in the last mile is one way to help fight that. One concern about electric vehicles has been their limited range and performance compared to gas vehicles. But since 95% of parcel deliveries require ranges under 100 miles, commercially available zero-emission vehicles could easily fulfill these ranges.
Some cities are already exploring bicycle, drone and robot deliveries. Electric vehicles fall in this category as well.
Move to micro-fulfillment
Experts believe that enterprises can improve their sustainability by staging goods closer to consumers and solving some of the urban delivery issues.
Micro-fulfillment centers in the form of local smaller warehouse facilities, automated lockers, and click-and-collect points could help reduce harmful emissions and traffic congestion, according to an Accenture study on creating a sustainable last mile. A micro-fulfillment strategy in cities could reduce vehicle-related emissions by 16%-26% by 2025.
Revisit supply chain management strategies
Another complementary strategy lies in finding ways to optimize overall supply chain management methods around logistics, including better aligning the last mile with the rest of the distribution network.
One major consumer packaged goods company redesigned its supply chain to reduce the overall miles traveled by 11%, said Michael Zimmerman, partner in the strategic operations practice of global management consulting firm Kearney, headquartered in Chicago. The change produced a 10% improvement on $250 million in supply chain costs and reduced the company’s carbon footprint by 6,700 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.
Pack deliveries more efficiently
Since inefficient packing — often as a result of the push for fast deliveries — requires more vehicles to go out on the road, looking for packing efficiencies is a critical aspect of last-mile sustainability.
Consumer packaged goods companies are also finding ways to optimize the packaging dimension that reduces the pallets used, Zimmerman said. This can allow them to fit more products on each truck, lowering the total number of trucks on the road.
Teams can further improve sustainability by considering how the final container is packaged for transit, said Tara Milburn, founder and CEO of Ethical Swag, a Certified B Corp located in Novia Scotia, that distributes promotional products. This includes making sure the box is no larger than needed and that you’ve opted for sustainable packaging.
“This can be a complex process for many companies because shipment packages come in all shapes and sizes,” Millburn said. “It takes careful thought and consideration to make sure each client’s package is thoughtfully assembled.”
Explore sustainable packaging options
The amount of cardboard and plastic trash that home deliveries generate is staggering.
For example, in 2019 alone Amazon created 465 million pounds of plastic packaging waste, according a report from Oceana, a nonprofit organization.
The report focused on Amazon since it’s the giant of e-commerce, but other companies contribute to the issue, albeit on a smaller scale, and can learn from some of the takeaways.
For example, 86% of customers worried about plastic pollution, and 87% wanted Amazon and other retail giants to take major steps to reduce plastic packaging, including offering plastic-free packaging at checkout. Clearly, creating a more sustainable last-mile delivery requires funneling investments toward new packaging approaches. Prioritizing sustainable packaging options is key.
Realize greening the last mile is complicated
By 2030, demand for last-mile deliveries is expected to grow by 78% and emissions from those are expected to grow by more than 30% in 100 cities across the globe, according to a 2020 study by the World Economic Forum.
However, by forming public-private partnerships to create infrastructure improvements, looking for opportunities to improve sustainability as quickly as possible and exploring a variety of strategies, those numbers can change and companies can help bring emissions and costs down significantly.

It’s estimated that about 50 percent of car trips in urban areas are three miles or less in length, making them a possible candidate for replacement with other modes. 
By Skip Descant
It stands to reason that moving more car trips in urban areas to micromobility modes will reduce congestion. New research quantifies this reduction, offering another tool for policymakers and infrastructure planners.
A study from Carnegie Mellon University zeroes in on how micromobility — namely e-bikes — can affect congestion in Seattle, finding that if even 10 percent of short car trips during peak afternoon travel were replaced with micromobility, more than 4,800 car trips would not happen, decreasing vehicle miles traveled by more than 7,300 miles a day, a 2.76 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
“The big takeaways are that micromobility could decrease congestion, especially on highly congested corridors. But you’re going to need wide-scale bike lane deployment,” said Corey Harper, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and one of the authors of the study.
It’s estimated that about 50 percent of car trips in urban areas are three miles or less in length, making them a possible candidate for replacement with other modes.
Americans are not huge cyclists. Only about 1 percent of trips in the United States are taken by biking, according to the 2017 National Household Travel Survey. But one of the many side effects of the COVID-19 pandemic was an increase in cycling in a number of metro areas. And micromobility advocates have been bullish about the growth potential for this transportation sector.
Speaking at the Micromobility World Conference last month, Travis VanderZanden, founder and CEO of Bird, said his company’s aim has always been to serve short trips.
“So far, it seems like we’ve been able to have a pretty good impact on some of these short-range trips. But there’s still a lot of work to be done,” said VanderZanden.
VanderZanden also stressed the need for more micromobility infrastructure to better serve these new forms of transportation.
“We need to continue to solve this chicken and egg problem for cities by showing them, hey, people are willing to get out of cars now. Let’s make sure the infrastructure follows suit. And that’s bike lanes. But it’s also more dedicated parking for micromobility as well,” said VanderZanden.
“Right now,” said Harper, “if you replaced a lot of short car trips with bikes, then these bike trips are going to interfere with private vehicles, because there’s not a lot of bike lanes.”
In Seattle, it’s estimated that 18 percent of short car trips could be replaced with micromobility, and during peak travel times, some 70 percent of trips in the Puget Sound region are made by private vehicles, according to the study.
The research could be used by metropolitan planning agencies, cycling advocates, transportation planners and others, said Harper.
“This quantifies the impacts more bike lanes could have in terms of energy use and getting more people out of cars and onto bikes,” he added.
It will take more than pedal power to solve the world’s climate crisis, say researchers, who note replacing a lot of short urban trips with micromobility would likely do more to improve congestion than to reduce energy usage. The reason is simple: Longer trips, made by cars and other vehicles, still account for the bulk of emissions associated with the transportation sector.
“So we’re going to do a whole lot more than just replace short trips with micromobility. We’re going to have to electrify vehicles, buses, trucks. We have to target longer trips with commuter trains, commuter buses, in order for cities to meet those climate change targets that the White House set out,” said Harper. “We’re going to have to do a lot more than just say, ‘Alright, everybody get on a bike.'”

 Mobility as a Service (MaaS) remains a trending term for media  platforms and app developers to use. However, David Hensher, Chinh Ho  and John Nelson suggest the term should be used more appropriately to  describe a fully integrated and sustainable system, rather than just an  enhanced travel planning app.                                                                                                              
Almost without exception, many media platforms post a growing amount of news items under the heading of Mobility as a Service or MaaS.  LinkedIn, for example, is replete with such material (including webinars) promoted in the name of MaaS. But how much of this news is really about MaaS? We had previously tried to clarify what MaaS is and  what MaaS is not with a benchmark definition, but it still seems as if the app developers (or more accurately the travel planner folks) and  many transport operators, continue to promote their new tools as MaaS. 
A  most recent one (there are too many to mention) is Scottish MaaS trial goes live (launched on 21 June). It is not MaaS. It is a multi-modal journey planner. The promo video  states that it is “travel made simple” and a ‘travel companion’. While  this is a nice idea and potentially represents a step-forward in terms  of meeting traveller needs with an integrated ticketing and payment  function, overly promoting such an app as MaaS suggests that many MaaS  promoters on social media don’t get, or refuse to get, what constitutes  MaaS and the four levels of MaaS integration.
To clarify what MaaS is, and is not, ITLS researchers, together with 
MaaS pioneers and advocators, have put forward a benchmark definition as
 follows[1]:
‘MaaS is a framework for delivering a portfolio of multi-modal 
mobility services that places the user at the centre of the offer. MaaS 
frameworks are ideally designed to achieve sustainable policy goals and 
objectives. MaaS is an integrated transport service brokered by an 
integrator through a digital platform. A digital platform provides 
information, booking, ticketing, payment (as PAYG and/or subscription 
plans), and feedback that improves the travel experience. The MaaS 
framework can operate at any spatial scale(i.e., urban or 
regional or global) and cover any combination of multi-modal and 
non-transport-related multi-service offerings, including the private car
 and parking, whether subsidised or not by the public sector. MaaS is 
not simply a digital version of a travel planner, nor a flexible 
transport service (such as Mobility on Demand), nor a single shared 
transport offering (such as car sharing). ‘Emerging MaaS’ best describes
 MaaS offered on a niche foundation. This relates to situations where 
MaaS is offered on a limited spatial scale, to a limited segment of 
society or focused on limited modes of transport. The MaaS framework 
becomes mainstream when the usage by travellers dominates a spatial 
scale and the framework encompasses a majority of the modes of 
transport. All the other variants that do not meet our definition might 
be referred to as ‘Aspiring MaaS’ given the normal usage of ‘aspiring’ 
having ‘hope’ or ‘ambitions’. (Hensher et al. 2021)
Let us try and simplify this position in a way that may be more 
persuasive in ensuring that MaaS is properly ascribed to, since if we 
continue to promote any mobility idea as MaaS, particularly the growth 
industry of travel planning apps, then the real fear is that we enter 
into a downward spiral of time wasted on debate and effort that amounts 
to nothing more than confusion, frustration and lack of progress on what
 can really make a difference to delivering sustainable (and 
commercially attractive) solutions and improved traveller satisfaction.
Critically, MaaS needs to show value in both sustainability and profitability  to have buy-in from both government/society and business. Without these  two critical value propositions, and buy-in from critical stakeholders  in the MaaS eco-system, MaaS will likely develop as a niche service, and  techno/app developers can (and will) lead the debates which may not  deliver real long term value for society. How exactly we achieve buy-in  from both business and government is yet unknown, but the evidence we  have amassed so far suggests that it is difficult and requires a lot of  collaboration and trust between stakeholders, which is far from assured. 
 Unless MaaS brokers/aggregators can negotiate with transportation  network companies (TNCs), and government, to use a cross-subsidy  strategy to fund MaaS services that deliver both socially acceptable  sustainability and commercial goals, MaaS is unlikely to ever be  profitable or societally sustainable. In most markets in general, any  unprofitable products and services would likely receive no significant  investment from businesses to obtain scalability unless there is a high  level of confidence in turning the corner in the (foreseeable) future.  MaaS is no different. Without the possibility of scalability, MaaS  becomes ‘another’ initiative in the government’s list of initiatives to  prioritise. The path to scalability currently seems to suffer from a  dominant focus on the next enhanced digital platform and very little  else.
So what is the value proposition likely to be that we should support?  If it is agreed that MaaS is unlikely to be commercial and thus is only  of value if it delivers on sustainability goals, then it is doubtful it  will go beyond what we can achieve already through the existing ways of  delivering transport.
 This is the big question. How can MaaS really  make a difference? It may be that an App developer offering better and  timely information remains relevant and convenient for some, but we ask  the promoters to stop calling this MaaS since it only improves travel  information, although this improvement is still valuable (and the  addition of other contextual / points of interest information is also  useful). But does it change travel behaviour enough to claim an impact  on sustainable goals? Collective evidence, we have to date, suggests  that a MaaS app will not change travel behaviour to deliver  sustainability outcomes, but a fully integrated MaaS system can in time  (Ho et al. 2021). Without the need to show complicated modelling  evidence, this early finding is easy to comprehend.
It remains a challenge to get key players in the intelligent mobility  space to recognise that offering a mixture of modes with the exact same levels of services such as travel times, reliability, and frequency  (which are the real drivers of traveller behavior) already offered outside of a MaaS eco-system, with PAYG financial discounts associated with some journey planning Apps, can hardly be claimed as added-value for travellers. This is why we would prefer if the great majority of App developers and transport suppliers and their advisers start talking about ‘Enhanced Travel Information Service’ or ETIS and not MaaS!

This is the era of drones, and these unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, increasingly are becoming an integral part of everyday life.
As drones evolve, industries and governments alike are finding new ways to make use of this emerging technology. TechNewsWorld spoke with several experts to find out how drones are being put into service, and what’s on the horizon for their future use.
One theme in all of their perspectives is that ultimately, drones aren’t simply flying machines; they’re also data gatherers and processors.
“At the end of the day, our drone industry’s product is data, not aircraft,” Reese Mozer, co-founder and CEO of American Robotics, explained to TechNewsWorld. “With true automation comes the ability to collect a new category of data not previously possible, and as a result a new category of valuable analytics and insights.”
Drones range in size from that of a large aircraft to those that fit in the palm of your hand. The services they can perform are of equal variety.
“Drones are aerial robots,” Richard Schwartz, president and CEO of Pensa Systems, told TechNewsWorld. “They are lightweight, agile, a hundred times cheaper than bulky ground-based robots, and able to ‘hop over’ — no pun intended — obstacles and changes in physical locations.
“Because of this, they have the potential to be a scalable industry and multisector solution, using autonomous perception — that is, where the computer is seeing and translates what it sees into actionable impact — to further automate tasks that are either tedious or difficult for people.”
Building Drones
One innovation in the drone world has been the development of new methods of building drones themselves, including in-home workshops or other small workstations in Aquiline Drones’ Agile Manufacturing Pod (AMP) model.
“AMP is a portable, high-tech workstation that can be installed in homes, businesses, battlefields, and other settings to address the growing demand for drone services in the country,” Barry Alexander, founder and CEO of Aquiline Drones, explained to TechNewsWorld.
“It is essentially a proprietary modular manufacturing process that transforms any 12-foot by 12-foot area into a mini manufactory center in less than one day.”
This mobile manufacturing system is changing not just the way drones are made, but the way people work, as well.
“All AMP operators receive detailed instructions and guidance through the AD Cloud, an AI system that streamlines inventory, quality control and shipping,” said Alexander. “Operators can then produce as many drones as they desire, knowing that it takes approximately eight hours to produce one drone.
“Once constructed, Aquiline Drones will then purchase AMP-produced drones directly from the operator, paying between $200 to $800 above the cost of production, depending on the particular drone model.”
Emergency Response
A variety of industries and businesses are finding ways to use the unique powers of drones, especially given their capacities to gather and process data. One of the major benefits of drones in a variety of business situations is that they are, simply, safer than using people.
“On the safety front, drones reduce the requirement to utilize helicopters and human beings from climbing on vertical structures to conduct inspections,” Dave Culler, senior vice president of strategic partnerships for PrecisionHawk, told TechNewsWorld.
“Also, once a critical issue is identified from a drone, the repair is very focused, minimizing the time requirement of someone being on the structure. The quality will only improve, and AI models will ensure the critical issues are discovered in minimal time.
“Drones are very environmentally-friendly, especially compared to a helicopter flying and carrying thousands of pounds of jet fuel,” explained Culler.
Because of their unique capabilities, drones have become a vital part of the work of first responders, providing information about disasters, crimes, and other events before any person is on the scene.
“Drones provide effective disaster and medical response, including the delivery of emergency supplies and equipment to victims in areas that are not safe to travel to by others,” said Alexander.
“They can be deployed ahead of police to provide first-person viewpoints of crimes in action, including live footage of the scene and images of criminals. In a ‘smart city’ initiative, AI-driven sensors designed to pick up abnormal sounds associated with crimes and danger can be positioned in key locations across a region to give police advance warnings thus, keeping them safer on the job.
“When seconds count in an emergency event, drones can be organized ahead of first responders, fire departments and EMTs to access the situation, provide a critical analysis of the scene, and deliver lifesaving supplies to victims that are not readily accessible by a human person in time.”

Deliveries, too, are being transformed by drone technology — a trend that’s likely to increase.
“Drones can perfectly complement other means of transportation, especially in rural or hard-to-reach areas,” Thomas Dreiling, a spokesperson for Wingcopter, explained to TechNewsWorld.
“In many cases, they can deliver goods on-demand, much faster, more efficiently and, in the case of electrically-powered drones such as the Wingcopter, more environmentally-friendly than trucks, vans, or helicopters.”
Autonomously Into the Future
Drone technology is evolving quickly. As they become more sophisticated, drones are expected to become a more prominent part of everyday life in the not-so-distant future.
“Drones will play an ever-growing role in our lives, be it for deliveries, for mapping/surveying or inspection purposes, or for precision agriculture,” explained Dreiling.
“Use cases with a clearly positive societal impact such as drone-based medical delivery networks that improve access to healthcare in rural, underserved communities will increase the public’s acceptance and lead the way for other applications.”
As they become more autonomous, drones will become more integrated into all facets of human life and activities.
“We’re only a few years off from having most drones flying autonomously, long distances and inspecting, delivering pizzas and providing medical supplies in minimal time,” predicted Culler.
“The U.S. military today can fly and monitor drones across the globe. The same will be true for commercial drone applications. Inspections can and will happen from distance locations.
“Drones will also autonomously integrate with other robotic capabilities, ensuring air and ground capture complete the full end-to-end inspection solution. Automation, machine learning, and AI will advance the quality of inspections and data, ensuring insight to action is at the speed of light.”

New Zealand’s micromobility sector
 is about blow up, with revenue expected to grow from $9.5 million in 
2020 to $2.4 billion by 2030. Paired with growth in EV adoption, a 
general desire to reduce carbon emissions, and navigating a post-Covid 
world, micromobility is increasingly looking like the future of 
transport.

 ‘Micromobility’ refers to small, lightweight vehicles that typically 
operate below the 25-30kmh mark, either as rentals or privately owned. 
Think Lime scooters or Onzo bikes, as well as the various e-bikes and 
e-scooters you can buy off the shelf.
  They are often used as ‘first mile/lastmile’ solutions in tandem with  public transport (for example to or from the home or office from the  train or bus station) or even a private car (to and from a car park).Current Time 0:00/Duration 0:30 WARWICK SMITH/STUFFPalmerston  North welcomes the arrival of e-scooters with mayor Grant Smith test  riding scooters of each of the three companies represented.
 Stuff spoke to Katherine Sandford, CEO of UBCO,
 about the micromobility industry in New Zealand, who said that 
micromobility has been largely driven by electric transportation, in 
particular the rise of the e-scooter.
 According to PS Market Research,
 the e-scooter has taken off due to the “additional comfort they offer 
over pedal-assisted bikes.” They also allow people to move faster and 
more conveniently, trading e-bikes and cars for public transport and 
e-scooters.
 Additionally, micromobility is a low-cost option, which appeals to a lot of New Zealanders.

 “With micromobility, users need not take the hassle of buying a vehicle
 and bearing vehicle maintenance, insurance, charging/refuelling, 
parking, and other expenses. The option of a low-cost commute thus 
motivates consumers to replace their walking phase with a suitable 
two-wheeler for first- and last-mile connectivity.”
 Sandford added that micromobility could also increase patronage in public transport by up to nine per cent by 2030, citing an NZTA study from 2021.

 “Cars and particularly electric cars will continue to be a valuable 
part of the total transport system, especially while public transport 
options are limited. What you use depends on the situation – whether 
you’re carrying a load of stuff, going between meetings or taking the 
kids to school. So we’ll need to make sure there are a range of 
sustainable options, as well as a high consideration of convenience.

 “People generally want to do the right thing, but if it requires too 
much effort or change in routine, then they’re far less likely to adopt a
 new approach.”

 Rising numbers startups in the sector show the current demand and 
potential for growth, mainly aiming to satisfy ‘last-mile’ connectivity.
 These include Lime, Neuron Mobility, Onzo and Beam Mobility.
  These are generally ‘dockless’ systems, which don’t require recharging  at a dedicated station when not in use, and can be both bikes and  scooters. They can be left anywhere and are usually unlocked via a  mobile application. While convenient, it means that dockless bikes  easily clutter up the streets, or even be dumped in a harbour… 
  If you’re considering investing or even starting your own micromobility  company, Sandford recommends being “obsessed” with solving your end-user’s problem.

 “New Zealanders have a real knack for getting to the heart of tricky 
problems by understanding what makes people tick and ticked off. Fail 
fast – test, rework and test again until you find users who will 
consistently pay for your product – then you know you have product 
market-fit and are ready to scale.”
 Dockless systems are generally preferred because they are cheaper to deploy, operate, and maintain.
 Ubco is operating in both private and commercial fields,
 selling bikes direct to customers online as well as trialling a 
business model where it supplies a vehicle, manages all servicing and 
maintenance, and ensures up-time to an agreed service level, in return 
for a monthly fee.
  “Ultimately this type of model will be rolled out to consumers, but in  the meantime, we’re making it easy for them to order online, unpack and  configure the product at home, and then simply register the vehicle for  on-road usage through VTNZ.”

While Phoenix travel guides may not mention this, taking a ride in Waymo’s self-driving car should be at the forefront of that list. Travel the city via a fully autonomous vehicle you can book simply with an app on your phone.
Waymo, Google’s platform for driverless vehicles, provides fully autonomous cars seven days a week all around Phoenix. Dubbed ‘the World’s Most Experienced Driver’ by Alphabet AI, Waymo has driven over 20 billion miles so far, with the sole mission to make travelling easier and safer. In 2020, Alphabet expanded the tech to commercial trucks. 
Waymo calls itself a self-driving technology company rather than a self-driving car company. Their fleet of thousands of self-driving cars is powered with sensors like lidar, enabling driver-free operations and 360-degree perception technology to identify obstacles. 
Waymo, back in October 2020, announced its plan of launching fully driverless vehicles to the public. It is wholly focused on full autonomy. “We’re building systems that operate without any reliance on human drivers. Either the system can complete the entire trip, or it cannot,” the team at Waymo explained. 
In this article, we break down how Waymo leverages AI/ML to create their dominating technology. 
Territory Marking & Prediction
Before operating in a new area, the Waymo Driver maps the territory with a high detailing rate. This includes noting the stop signs or the curbs, and the platform adopts these into custom maps equipped with real-time sensor data. This information is later mixed with real-time details to gauge how the road users might behave and drive accordingly. 
Advanced Sensors
Waymo has claimed to have built the most advanced sensors and perception systems with quality data. The system dataset contains more than 20 million autonomously driven miles and five generations of development. 
Its fifth-generation Driver comprises complementary sensors that include radar, lidar, and cameras that allow it to see 360 degrees around the vehicle. This considers the time of the day, bad weather conditions like rain or fog, and the variety of road users such as those double-parked vehicles whose riders can hop out at any second or the scooters cutting across traffic through a red light.
Waymo Blog Post A dense and highly detailed 3D view of its surroundings as generated by the system’s lidar
These sensors allow the vehicle to navigate the city streets accurately and track objects around, especially while taking turns or changing lanes. “Because of the long-range and high density provided by our sensors, the Waymo Driver can detect with high accuracy, and intelligently reason about small objects and movement at distances – such as spotting a truck door slowly opening in the flow of traffic as a person gets ready to hop out and deliver some packages,” according to Waymo’s blog post.
Waymo’s compute platform allows the Driver to process vast amounts of data and run real-time inference on large ML models. This will enable it to react immediately without additional human input, like when an emergency vehicle is approaching or when a dog runs out into the street. They even do this without needing a cell signal to operate.
Software and Training Structure
Waymo’s driving software is based on years of AI research, their Waymo Open Dataset Initiative, and research team Google Brain. The engineers working at Waymo operate in coordination with the Google Brain team to apply deep nets to the car’s pedestrian detection system. 
The team has created a robust, generalisable tech stack based on their operation in multiple environments and cities. The Waymo Driver has learnt to behave assertively and merge into traffic based on this experience. 
Waymo has invested in creating training softwares for the Waymo Driver. The Simulation City is software to test the autonomous vehicles and assess their performance for the cities Waymo is present in. It creates realistic conditions like spring showers, solar glare, or dimming light for the technology to experience; the researchers further learn from the system’s reactions.

Waymo blog post: an illustration of how the Simulation City draws a random outcome from a statistical distribution of the real world. 
The Waymo Driver itself is trained with a highly nuanced understanding of city roads with driving experience of more than 20 million miles on public roads and 20 million miles in simulation. It can adapt to the local driving conditions accurately, given this training.
For instance, in San Francisco, the system has learnt that the residents often drive slower on steep slopes and adapt to change its speed depending on traffic flow. Waymo Driver makes similar calculations while approaching crosswalks or lower visibility areas.
Tensorflow Ecosystem
Waymo has adopted the TensorFlow ecosystem and the data centres of Google, such as TPUs, for training its neural networks. Their rigorous testing on simulations and training cycles allows it to enhance its ML and autonomous system.
SurfelGAN 
The platform is leveraging AI to generate camera images to simulate sensor data gathered through its self-driving vehicles.  
In a recent paper, the researchers introduced the technique – SurfelGAN. This uses texture-mapped surface elements for reconstructing scenes and camera viewpoints to handle positions and orientations. This is a considerably more accessible and more data-driven path to simulate sensor data. The AI generates and preserves data based on real-world lidar sensors and camera feeds. This data is regarding the semantics, 3D geometry, and object appearances on the scene used to render a simulated scene through the reconstruction. 
Currently, Waymo is the only company operating a fully autonomous public ride-hailing service in the U.S. They have partnered with many car manufacturers like Jaguar Land Rover or Volvo to integrate the self-driving technology into their vehicles and with OEMs to expose their Driver to more places and people.

How and why semi-autonomous e-scooters are defining the future path of mobility?
Over the years, the automobile industry has seen a significant rise. With advances in artificial intelligence and autonomous technology, automakers are rapidly turning to driverless vehicles racing to develop autonomous cars. Not only autonomous vehicles but automobiles are also making efforts towards sustainable transportation. The development of e-scooters is a decisive stride towards long-term sustainability. Electric scooters define as the future of urban mobility. They are eco-friendly, noise-free, and pollution-free. As these scooters are already starting to gain traction, many e-scooter makers are now building semi-autonomous e-scooters that can drive autonomously with the least human intervention.
Understanding Semi-Autonomous Vehicles
Semi-autonomous vehicles are those vehicles that require the least human intervention. They typically use advanced driver assistant technologies to minimize the effort required to manoeuvre the vehicle.
Concerns around enhanced safety and security are relentlessly powering the customers’ demand for semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicle technologies. The adoption of these technologies may differ in different regions. The economically advanced countries, or developing countries, have already adopted semi-autonomous and autonomous technologies. For example, Blind Spot Detection (BSD), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Adaptive Front Lights (AFL), Intelligent Park Assist (IPA) and Lane Keep Assist (LKA).
Semi-Autonomous E-scooters
Electric scooters, dockless, shared bikes and other vehicle types are significantly reducing the physical footprint needed to move people from one place to another, over relatively short distances. These vehicle services are known as micro-mobility, and these services have resonated with consumers, as evinced by their rapid adoption over just the last several months.
As electric scooters are becoming ubiquitous in the modern transportation ecosystem, giving them some sort of autonomy makes a considerable change in the e-scooter landscape.
In August 2019, Beijing-based e-scooter maker Segway Ninebot unveiled a new e-scooter that can drive autonomously to its charging stations. The e-scooter, dubbed as KickScooter T60, has reportedly been said to be controlled remotely from the cloud. In a chat with Reuters, Ninebot chairman and CEO Gao Lufeng explained that “AI-driven e-scooters could lower operators’ costs of maintenance and improve the economics of scooter sharing.”
In 2018, more than 85,000 dockless electric scooters hit streets in the United States. These e- scooters were rented for 38.5 million trips, making them the most prevalent form of shared micro-mobility, according to the National Association of City Transportation. This increasing growth and popularity of these scooters indicate the future of electric scooters is here to stay.
Flo Mobility, a Bengaluru-based two-wheeler autonomous vehicle developer, is harnessing the power of autonomous technology. The company is building semi-autonomous e-scooters, utilizing computer vision capabilities, artificial intelligence for obstacle identification, robotics and the Internet of Things sub-systems.
Giving Autonomy to E-Scooters
Key players in the electric scooter scenario understand the value of autonomous technologies that are worth pursuing. Tortoise, an autonomous delivery company, builds technology that coalesces driverless and remote-controlled features. These features can be integrated into any vehicle type – e-scooter, and shared, dockless vehicles. The purpose behind this is to allow rentable scooters and bikes that are currently being scattered around cities to self-deploy where needed to more readily match supply to demand, simplifying retrieval, charging, and replacement. Autonomous vehicles that move without direct human intervention will significantly ease the major logistical burden of companies. They will also reduce clutter on streets and sidewalks for cities.
Some of the top e-scooter companies and startups in the world are Lime, Bird, Tier, Bounce, Voi Technology, Ather Energy, Wheels, Wind Mobility, Dott, Scoot, Hero Electric, Etergo, and others.

Alphabet’s Google cut fuel use and traffic delays by 10 per cent to 20 per cent at four locations in Israel by using artificial intelligence to optimise signal lights and it next plans to test the software in Rio de Janeiro, the company said on Wednesday (Oct 6).
The early-phase research project is among new software initiatives inside Google to combat climate change. Some employees as well as advocacy groups have called on the company, the world’s third-most valuable, to more urgently use its influence to combat the crisis.
While Google has not addressed critics’ calls to stop selling technology to oil companies or funding lawmakers who deny global warming, it has prioritised sustainability features.
Google plans in the coming weeks to allow its Nest thermostat users to buy renewable energy credits for US$10 a month to offset emissions from heating and cooling. Credits will come from projects in Texas including Bethel Wind Farm and Roseland Solar. A majority of the funds will go toward credit purchases and utility-bill payment costs, Google said, without elaborating on the remainder.
For no charge across the United States, Nest users soon can automatically shift heating and cooling to times when energy is cleaner.
New informational panels alongside search results show emissions or other environmental ratings of flights globally and cars and home appliances in the United States. To stem misinformation, English, Spanish and French queries mentioning “climate change” starting this month will feature explanations from the United Nations.
Based on early results in Israel’s Haifa and Beer-Sheva, Rio de Janeiro’s municipal traffic authority expressed high hopes for the AI to better time traffic signal changes. It told Reuters the system should be introduced within months with locations announced soon.
Aleksandar Stevanovic, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, said simulations show AI could smooth traffic flow. But he questioned whether a tech company without traffic engineering expertise ultimately could bring such software to reality.
“Every year there is someone new claiming we can do wonders,” he said.

Across Australia and around the globe, Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) are already making road travel safer, more efficient and more sustainable. Such systems are only becoming more and more relevant as population grows and the number of vehicles on the roads increases, with various ITS technologies offering solutions to decrease congestion, increase efficiency and mobility, and even save lives.
Fundamentally, ITS involves integrating information and communication technologies into transport systems to optimize operations. ITS encompass a broad range of systems and technologies, with varying levels of complexity and automation.
While smart systems can be applied to any form of transport, the term ITS is most frequently used in reference to road transport. The ‘currency’ of any ITS is its data, which is used to improve the transport system’s operations, often in real time.
As such, ITS employs a variety of wired or wireless technologies to collect, transmit, communicate and interpret data, with many also including automated control functions.
ITS infrastructure may involve technologies integrated into road networks (e.g. roadside sensors), within the vehicles themselves, or both. Essentially, ITS enhances connections between road users, vehicles, road infrastructure and transport system operators.
ITS solutions are generally applied to do one or more of the following:
Improve the mobility of people or goodsIncrease safetyReduce traffic congestion and increase transport efficiencyInform road users of conditionsRespond effectively to incidents and emergenciesIncrease the resiliency of the transport system in case of changed conditions or unforeseen disruptionsReduce air pollution or improve energy efficiencyAutomate billing processesAchieve policy objectives (such as demand management or transport priority)
Its infrastructure in action
ITS fulfill various vital functions on our roads, reaping significant benefits for road users and operators, as well as for our broader society and economy.
Traffic management
ITS traffic management is concerned with the overall management of traffic on a road. The ITS detects traffic situations and deploys traffic control strategies. Technology is applied to traffic signalling systems, traffic safety, and route and congestion management.
For example, the busiest roads around Melbourne, including the M80 Ring Road, Tullamarine, West Gate and Monash freeways, Eastlink and Citylink, use coordinated dynamic ramp metering to measure and regulate the number of vehicles entering and exiting in real time.
This enables each road to handle the maximum number of vehicles while maintaining traffic flow, reducing travel times and preventing safety issues associated with congestion.
Controlling traffic signals to only allow a certain number of vehicles to merge onto a road at a time helps break up groups of vehicles that might otherwise be competing for space, reducing the likelihood of collisions. Ramp metering signals that become operational during peak times have also been deployed as part of Sydney’s $600 million M4 Smart Motorway project.
Similarly, ITS such as the Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS) employ in-pavement detectors and other sensors at busy intersections to monitor demand for right-of-way and shifts in direction of demand.
Traffic signals then adapt accordingly, resulting in a smoother flow of traffic and minimising wait times. The SCATS Priority Engine also allows essential vehicles (such as emergency services) to be prioritised through traffic lights.
In Queensland, Hold the Red, an innovative intersection crash avoidance system trialled at four intersections in Brisbane and the Gold Coast, demonstrates the potential of ITS to prevent traffic incidents and enhance safety. The system uses radar to predict when a vehicle approaching the intersection is going to run a red light.
When this occurs, the system extends the all-red phases of lights at the intersection by two seconds, preventing other vehicles or pedestrians from entering the intersection where they could collide with the offending vehicle.
Traveller information
A common function of ITS technology is to better inform road users about road, environment and traffic conditions. These services enable road users to plan the most efficient route, avoid delays and quickly become aware of any changed conditions, potential hazards or emergency situations.
For instance, signs may display current travel times or advise of incidents or lane closures, or real-time information about conditions might be conveyed via highway advisory radio or reflected in GPS data.
Real-time traffic information signs and variable message signs are employed on a variety of roads around Australia, while certain busy car parks use parking guidance systems to advise of parking availability.
For example, the Parramatta Parking Finder helps support people with accessibility issues by providing information about accessible parking spaces around the Parramatta CBD including photos of the space and a rating out of five for the size of the space, hoist suitability and kerb ramp access.
Some of the potential benefits of ITS integrated with connected and semi-autonomous vehicles have been demonstrated by a trial undertaken by the Victorian Department of Transport on Eastlink, which involved the operational deployment of semi-AVs and cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS).
The project developed a DSRC messaging platform that delivered real-time road warnings in a high-speed environment, with high reliability and precision (to location and lane), without interfering with the existing tolling system.
Emergency management and response
The real-time monitoring capabilities of ITS can greatly reduce emergency response times, saving lives, preventing secondary incidents and reducing disruptions.
For instance, if a collision occurs, the relevant authorities are alerted, and the nearest emergency vehicle is located and dispatched to the scene.
Other drivers on the road can be alerted through dynamic signage and signals may change to prevent too many vehicles entering the area of the accident until it is safe to do so.
In South Australia, on the section of the North-South Corridor between Torrens Road and River Torrens, a Thermal Video Incident Detection System detects slowing, stopped or wrong direction vehicles within 5-15 seconds, fast-tracking incident response actions.
These include notifying drivers of lane closures and congestion using variable message signs and monitoring the situation with CCTV pan-tilt-zoom cameras.
Meanwhile, the Queensland Police Service employs drones and motorcycles to expedite serious crash scene clearance times, allowing traffic managers to estimate the duration and severity of congestion impacts and use existing ITS technologies to help manage congestion and prevent secondary incidents.
Using drone technology to map crash scenes, the Forensic Crash Unit has reduced scene mapping time by 50 per cent, reducing road closure times and traffic congestion, while also improving the quality of evidence captured at scenes.
In Brisbane, a structural health monitoring system has been developed to detect damage to the iconic old Sir Leo Hielscher Bridge (the Gateway Bridge) in real time, before it can affect public safety. These are just some of the ways in which ITS are currently transforming Australian road travel, with much more to come.
As the field of ITS continues to develop rapidly, the deployment of smart systems on our roads can help address significant social, economic and environmental issues.
With the costs of congestion predicted to rise to as much as $40 billion by 2030, and over a thousand lives still lost on our roads each year, we cannot afford to miss this opportunity to reap significant benefits at a relatively low cost, leveraging data to revolutionise road transport.

						Waymo will start by mapping the city in preparation to deploy its fully self-driving vehicles.
											
					
Alphabet Inc’s autonomous driving arm Waymo,  which spun out of Google’s self-driving car project, is deploying its  autonomous vehicles in New York City. Beginning tomorrow, Waymo’s  mapping vehicles start mapping the city in preparation for a more  widespread deployment of fully-autonomous vehicles.
As
 one of the most densely populated cities in the world, New York poses 
difficult challenges for Waymo’s self-driving vehicles. The city’s 
streets are clogged with cars, pedestrians, bicyclists and delivery 
vehicles. 
Waymo plans to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service in major U.S. cities called “Waymo One“,  which is similar to Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing providers. More  recently, Waymo has been testing its autonomous vehicles in San  Francisco. 
“Autonomous vehicles hold the 
promise to dramatically improve traffic flow and expand access to 
convenient and affordable transportation for millions of New Yorkers,” 
said newly elected NYC mayor Eric Adams. “I’m excited to welcome Waymo 
to New York so that one day we can have safe autonomous technology on 
our streets.”
To successfully navigate in  this challenging environment, the first steps for Waymo are to fully map  the streets of New York City, since the company’s fleet of autonomous  vehicles relies on high-definition maps with centimeter-level accuracy for safe navigation.  These HD maps allow Waymo’s vehicles to navigate in places even where  GPS signals are spotty, such as in tunnels or between skyscrapers.
With
 the backing of Google over the years, Waymo has emerged as a leading 
developer of self-driving technology. The company’s fleet of autonomous 
vehicles has traveled over 20 million miles on public roads
 in cities across the U.S., with billions of more miles in computer 
simulation to perfect its autonomous driving platform that Waymo calls 
the “Waymo Driver.”
For the time being, 
Waymo’s mapping vehicles in New York will be manually operated by 
autonomous specialists at all times, the company said.
Testing  its vehicle in New York City will allow Waymo will give Waymo  opportunities to learn more about how its Waymo Driver handles urban  driving in snow, rain and other winter weather conditions. By assessing  the way Waymo vehicles perform in inclimate weather, Waymo will be able  to make improvements to its software based on real world scenarios, then  apply these learnings across its entire fleet.
Waymo’s
 New York fleet, which will start with five Chrysler Pacifica minivans 
outfitted with hardware to support autonomous driving and mapping 
capabilities, will primarily operate south of Central Park. Waymo said 
its areas of operation will extend down through the city to the 
Financial District and the southern end of Manhattan, as well as out to a
 small section of New Jersey through the Lincoln Tunnel, which connects 
New York to New Jersey across the Hudson River.
Waymo
 will also be driving its zero-emission Jaguar I-PACEs electric SUVs 
equipped with its latest technology on the same streets in Manhattan. 
The company said the insights gathered will help the Waymo Driver improve its ability to perceive and predict the actions of other road users in dense urban areas.
“The  more information we gather about the way our city moves, the closer we  get to creating a more efficient, sustainable, and safe mobility  network.” said Tech:NYC Executive Director Julie Samuels. “NYC is  excited to welcome Waymo to New York to help us learn how our streets —  from bike and bus lanes to highways and walkways — really work.”
In August, the Waymo One service opened to a select group of “trusted testers” in San Francisco.
 The company was recently approved to begin picking up passengers in its
 driverless vehicles for the first time, after years of extensive 
testing using safety drivers behind the wheel.
Waymo’s
 Trusted Tester pilot is a research-focused program that invites San 
Francisco residents to participate and help the company shape the future
 of fully autonomous ride-hailing. Waymo takes valuable feedback from 
its trusted testers to continuously improve its service. 
Prior to opening Waymo One to its trusted testers, the company was picking up its own employees in the city.
Just  like Uber and Lyft, the Waymo One service has a smartphone app where  customers can summon one of the company’s self-driving vehicles. Once  seated and bucked up, riders press the trip start button to begin their  trip. A monitor installed in the backseat of each vehicle shows the  vehicle’s perception systems in real time and riders get an expanded  look at what the self-driving vehicle “sees” as it navigates  autonomously in the city.
Riders also have a
 pull over button in case a passenger needs to cut their trip short. If a
 rider presses the button, the Waymo vehicles will pull over in a safe 
location and let them out.
Prior to 
launching the Waymo One service in San Francisco for select riders, the 
company has been testing its technology in the Phoenix Metro Area since 
2016, mapping streets and improving its self-driving software for the 
Waymo One ride-hailing service.
In September, Waymo and Cruise LLC, the autonomous driving unit of automaker General Motors, were
 issued permits by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to 
deploy their commercial self-driving vehicles in San Francisco and pick up paying customers.
The  permits pave the way for a more broader deployment of the Waymo One  autonomous ride-hailing services in the San Francisco Bay Area and in  other major cities like New York.

 A pause in one of the largest transit systems in the U.S. inspired an award-winning pilot project to improve public transportation. 
 By Steve Mazur

Throughout America’s history, cities that have invested in a reliable and robust network of roads, bridges and public transportation have been key to the growth of the nation’s economy.
Take Chicago, for example. The city ranks third in economic output in the country. Chicago is home to one of the best and largest public transit systems, second only to New York City’s.
Before the coronavirus pandemic, the Chicago Transit Authority reported bus and rail ridership totaled 455.7 million rides in 2019 (237.3 million bus rides and 218.4 million rail rides). In 2020, ridership plummeted amid the pandemic, particularly during March, April and May.
By the end of 2020, the CTA reported bus and rail ridership had risen to 197.5 million (121.5 million bus rides and 76.0 million rail rides). While this reflects a 57.6 percent average drop in ridership from 2019, it is a steady climb from its lowest point during lockdowns, when most city buses and trains were empty.
Restoring ridership to pre-pandemic levels has presented a major challenge for cities across the country, and Chicago is no exception. According to the CTA, 1.6 million bus and train rides are taken on an average weekday across the regional CTA transit system that serves the greater metropolitan region, inclusive of the city and 35 suburbs. Certain routes operate around-the-clock.
Because it is viewed as the circulatory system driving the economic vitality of Chicago, the CTA recognized the urgent need for a way to collect and analyze vehicle capacity in order to optimize routes, increase rider comfort and improve the passenger experience —all cornerstones to bringing riders back.
Chicago Gets Real-Time Data to Improve Transit Service 
As is the case for many transit agencies, much of the CTA’s data on transit vehicle capacity was incomplete, not available in real time or based on historic averages that may or may not reflect current realities, especially in the face of changing public health guidelines.
Without accurate real-time occupancy data and demand forecasts, the CTA had no insight into when and where to adjust service to ensure efficiency and reliability, appropriate social distancing, and shorter wait times.
To leverage its existing data and collect new data through advanced technology, the CTA turned to City Tech Collaborative, a Chicago-based urban solutions accelerator, which spearheaded a passenger-counting pilot project to understand vehicle occupancy in real time. The pilot was deployed on 10 buses from March to August along the CTA’s 79th Street bus route, one of the agency’s busiest, measuring the efficacy of various passenger-counting technologies.
The pilot served several purposes:
Capturing demand and using data from existing bus video assetsUsing data management tools to support CTA operationsApplying analytics and predictive models for proactive demand management
Building on the CTA’s existing measures and passenger-counting technology to keep bus and train service timely, efficient and safe, City Tech and an ecosystem of partners implemented video analytics, onboard cameras and routers to provide real-time insights into occupancy across multiple vehicles.
The pilot project recently received the IoT Deployment of the Year Award from IoT World Today, demonstrating the value of IoT technology in helping the CTA proactively meet route ridership demand; reduce passenger crowding and wait times; and provide a safe, socially distanced rider experience.
How to Streamline Technology Within Transit Agencies
A forthcoming report from the CTA will show how this model holds great potential for solving current challenges within core functions of society, as well as for building a solid foundation for future operations that prioritize the greater good.
Over the years, transit agencies have gradually added different applications and systems to their fleets of vehicles, such as:
Fare collection and payment terminal backhaulComputer-aided dispatch and automatic vehicle location (CAD/AVL)High-speed passenger internet accessPassenger countersClosed-circuit security camerasRemote engine diagnostics and fuel consumptionVehicle telematics, including information on speed and idle timeDigital maps, signage and advertising
However, implementing these applications and systems in a cost-effective way has been challenging. The municipal authority may have started with GPS navigation and vehicle tracking CAD/AVL systems, then later added onboard and in-terminal payment systems that needed backhaul to the central office. Then came passenger Wi-Fi, digital signage, security cameras and more.
The result for many transit agencies was a multitude of systems that do not integrate with one another and do not use the same internet connectivity methods and cellular carriers.
For municipalities already burdened with managing large fleets while maintaining an IT infrastructure on a tight budget, the challenges can stack up. With even more hardware, software and connectivity to maintain and manage, the risk of system failure only increases. The better answer is to consolidate all vehicle connectivity through a single, robust connection platform.
As unpredictability becomes the new norm, the future of transit belongs to agencies, operators and authorities that can leverage smart, secure and cost-efficient connectivity to improve the rider experience, lower costs, and improve safety and performance. In doing so, they invest in the continued economic growth of their cities as well as the American economy.

Multiple companies are working on new aerial modes of transportation, be they taxis that fly, drones that drive, or cars that drive and fly. What most of these vehicles have in common is that they’re intended for just a few people to ride in at once, like airborne Ubers. But a New York-based startup is thinking bigger, quite literally: Kelekona is developing an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle that will be able to transport 40 people at once.
The aircraft’s design is sleek and futuristic, with a flat shape not unlike a UFO. But for all the apparent flare of the design, Kelekona’s founder, Braeden Kelekona, actually has practicality on the brain; he told Digital Trends, “We have a really small airspace in New York. It never made sense to us to create a small aircraft that was only able to carry up to six people. You have to have the kind of mass transit we rely on here in the city. It makes sense to try to move as many people as possible in one aircraft, so that we’re not hogging airspace.”
He’s got a point. There’s a lot more space in the sky than on the ground, obviously, but flight paths need to be carefully planned and contained within specific areas, particularly in and near big cities. If flying taxis became affordable enough for people to use them the way we use Uber and Lyft today, there would quickly be all sorts of issues with traffic and congestion, both in the sky and with takeoff and landing space on the ground. So why not take a scaled approach from the beginning?
Speaking of affordability, Kelekona says that’s a priority, too. It may play out differently, especially in the technology’s early stages, but the intention is for tickets on the drone bus to cost the same as a train ticket for an equivalent distance. The first route, from Manhattan to the Hamptons, will reportedly have a 30-minute flight time and an $85 ticket price.
Other intended routes include Los Angeles to San Francisco, New York City to Washington DC, and London to Paris—all in an hour, which is comparable to the time it takes for a regular flight right now. One of the differences, ideally, will be that the eVTOLs will be able to land and take off closer to city centers, given that they won’t require long runways.
For this same reason, the company also envisions a streamlined approach to connecting warehouses; its aircraft will be able to carry 12 to 24 shipping containers, or a 10,000-pound cargo payload.
Moving that much weight, plus the weight of the aircraft itself, will demand a lot of battery power. The aircraft’s body will be made of 3D printed composite and aluminum and equipped with eight thrust vectoring fans with propellors whose pitch can change for the different stages of flight: vertical takeoff, forward flight, and landing. All of this will be built around a giant modular battery pack.
“Instead of building an interesting airframe and then trying to figure out how to put the battery into that aircraft, we started with the battery first and put things on top of it,” Kelekona said. The battery pack will have 3.6 megawatt hours of capacity, and will be built for easy swapping out with new iterations as battery technology continues to improve. The aircraft’s energy requirements will likely be the biggest challenge Kelekona faces in its design, production, and launch; at present, the aircraft is still in the computer simulation phase.
A British company called GKN Aerospace is developing a similar concept. Announced in February, Skybus would fit 30 to 50 passengers, and is intended for “mass transit over extremely congested routes.” Despite being made for vertical takeoff and landing, though, the aircraft design has large wings on either side; this would make it more challenging to find adaptable space in urban areas.

-There are an estimated 975,000 telematics insurance policies active in the UK, according to the latest figures from TheBritish Insurance Brokers’ Association (2018) out of approximately 33 million registered cars.
-Telematics car insurance is a way to track and score someone’s driving and thus decide how much to charge you for car insurance.
-This is particularly important for young drivers who would otherwise face high or unaffordable car insurance premiums.
-Young drivers, careful drivers and low mileage drivers can save up to 60% at renewal by installing a telematics product in their car, which reports the quality of their driving back to the insurance provider via GPS.  In fact, it is predicted 88% of new cars will carry integrated telematics within five years.
– insurethebox proactively communicates with its policyholders who display risky driving behaviours, providing them with the information they need to improve their driving. Amongst its communications is their award-winning Speed Reduction Programme,  which has seen upwards of 86,000 drivers reduce their speed by 22%, leading to a 6% reduction in accident frequency amongst its customers – helping to prevent an estimated 1,191 accidents and a further 50 serious injuries in the past 5 years
-Warren Hetz, UK CEO of Aioi Nissay Dowa Europe, parent company of insurethebox comments: “Our telematics products have long-provided an opportunity for drivers to improve their driving behaviour and earn rewards by providing a level of insight unavailable with traditional insurance. As a business, we observe the benefits of safer driving by our customers on a daily basis, and through this partnership with one of the UK’s pioneers in the insurance comparison space, we endeavour to expand our reach and provide these benefits to more drivers, of all ages.”
-A recent report linked further development in connected car technologies, based on current market trends, with an estimated 72,000 jobs in the industry and £2.7bn gross value added to the economy by 2035

Self-driving vehicles won’t be widely viable commercially until their AI guidance systems are better than human drivers and can adjust to unpredictable road circumstances.
By Esther Ajao

When electric car giant Tesla recently introduced a beta of it latest full self-driving software then withdrew it, the abrupt reversal encapsulated the stop-start state of autonomous vehicle technology.
In a tweet on Oct. 23 about the withdrawal of the system, Tesla CEO and founder Elon Musk said it’s impossible at this point to test all configurations of a fully self-driving vehicle.
That dilemma is at the heart of the fitful progress on autonomous vehicle technology by major automakers such as Ford, General Motors and Hyundai, and tech giants including Apple, Google’s Waymo subsidiary and Amazon’s Zoox robotaxi subsidiary.
The industry must also overcome daunting challenges in ensuring safety.
While Tesla cars now have only limited autonomous capabilities, the company has made significant advancements, including putting cars on the road with limited self-driving features.
But some experts say Tesla’s chief limitations stem from a sensor suite that is not quite diverse enough. And different iterations of that problem also afflict other developers of autonomous vehicle technology.
Tesla relies on mainly cameras and software to perform all aspects of sensing the environment surrounding the car, leaving its level of autonomy at what is known in the industry as level 2, meaning the driver’s hands must always be on the wheel. Others in the industry that are developing level 3 or 4 technology (vehicles that don’t require limited help from the driver or don’t require a safety driver) are using a combination of cameras, software, lidar, radar and updateable HD maps.
“The advantage to adding these additional sensor modalities is that it provides redundancy across environmental conditions … and road types, and provide[s] an alternative method to distinguish certain roadway elements and actors,” said Matt Arcaro, an analyst at IDC.
Advances in autonomous vehicle technology
A prominent vendor in this area is Waymo. The Google subsidiary runs a self-driving taxi service in a section of Phoenix.
The vendor is also working on using the technology in other areas such as trucking, logistics and personal vehicles. Recently Waymo and GM’s Cruise division were the first autonomous vehicle technology vendors to obtain autonomous vehicle permits in California that would allow them to transport passengers.
Other promising projects involve traditional and new automotive manufacturers working on autonomous technology for robotaxis and personal vehicles.
For example, in 2019 Volkswagen said it would join Ford in investing in AI vendor Argo AI to introduce autonomous vehicle technology in the U.S. and Europe. The companies committed to spending more than $4 billion through 2023 to develop their self-driving service.
Another involves Intel subsidiary Mobileye and SIXT, a provider of mobility services in Germany; the vendors plan to offer robotaxis in Munich next year.
Amazon’s Zoox is designing autonomous vehicles from the ground up. The Zoox strategy is distinguished by its unique model, which is not designed like a car and doesn’t have a front or a back end or even a steering wheel.
The safety issue with autonomous vehicles
Despite the advances in the technology and interest in it from the public and enterprises, the autonomous vehicle industry is still up against many challenges, chief among them safety.
Although the industry is making progress in trying to make sure the technology is safe, regulation that could enforce safety requirements is largely absent, and it is mostly unclear still how local authorities will administer laws and regulations governing the use of autonomous vehicles.
Some states have enacted legislation for autonomous vehicles. Nevada requires manufacturers to meet detailed testing and safety rules; maintain a $5 million insurance policy to test vehicles on public roads; and, as of now, place a safety driver on board.
“If it’s vague out there that you’re relying on each individual provider to come up with their own definition of safety, that’s not the right way to do it,” Arcaro said.
And if autonomous vehicles are not as safe or even safer than human drivers, then there’s no point to them, said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Guidehouse.
Abuelsamid noted that while human drivers are criticized for being responsible for most crashes, people are good at driving and most of the time they drive, they don’t crash.
“We have not yet proven that autonomous vehicles can do the same, especially in the more challenging conditions,” he said. “We will undoubtedly have more crashes and more fatalities with autonomous vehicles because it’s impossible to make a system that complex perfect. But if we make it better than humans, then we’ll make progress.”
The uses of autonomous vehicle technology
Another challenge with the technology is figuring out where it’s useful.
Vendors such as Waymo, Uber and Motional — a joint venture between Hyundai and autonomous vehicle technology vendor Aptiv — are using the technology to develop robotaxis.
However, the goal and challenge for businesses is to find wide applications for the technology that can help them make money.
One industry that’s crying out for autonomous vehicles is trucking, which is suffering from a widespread shortage of drivers. An autonomous vehicle out on the highway is much simpler than guiding a vehicle autonomously in the city.
Waymo’s Via system uses cameras, software, lidar and radar configured to the specific requirements of truck driving. Startup vendor Aurora has put autonomous trucks on the road with backup human drivers. However, Aurora hopes to remove the drivers by 2023 when It fully launches its trucking business.
While there appears to be a real need for autonomous vehicles in the trucking business, Arcaro said other sectors are interested too, but self-driving is not like “turning on a light switch.”
“A lot of enterprises are a little skeptical because of initial timelines, but they’re also open to the technology,” Arcaro said.
Challenges for automated driving systems
Part of the reason that enterprises are still skeptical is because while some models are being tested, autonomous vehicle technology is still firmly in the testing phase.
Driving is an extremely difficult task for AI technology to understand, according to Abuelsamid.[Driving] takes a lot of nuance and nuance is something that computers and software are actually not good at.Sam AbuelsamidAnalyst, Guidehouse
“It takes a lot of nuance, and nuance is something that computers and software are actually not good at,” he said.
One reason is because AI is not as adaptable as the human brain and can fail in unpredictable ways.
The task of an automated driving system is broken down into four major steps:
The first step is sensing and perception, using a software system on top of a sensor array including cameras, radar, lidar and ultrasonic sensors. The sensors look at the world around the vehicle to detect what’s around it — in much the same way humans use their five senses to understand objects and distinguish them from each other.
The next step is to make sense of what all the different objects around the vehicle are. After that, the technology must be able to predict what the objects — including pedestrians, bicyclists, other vehicles and roadway items — might do within three to five seconds.
After the prediction, the next step is to plan a path for a vehicle to drive through that environment.
The final step is control. This is where the system sends signals to the steering and brakes and accelerator to make the car or truck go where it needs to.
“Perception is really hard for software,” Abuelsamid said. “AI systems can actually be fooled by subtle changes.”
One of the thorniest problems for autonomous vehicle technology is the prediction phase. While it might be easy for the autonomous vehicle to understand what other vehicles could do, pedestrians are relatively unpredictable and can easily change their minds at any moment.
“So, it has taken longer to create autonomous vehicles that can operate reliably in the kinds of environments with which humans have few problems,” Abuelsamid said.
For engineers, it’s about being able to manage and deploy a system that can support not only 99% of what is predictable, but also the small fraction that is unpredictable, Arcaro said.
“That last one percent is very difficult,” he continued. “That’s what’s keeping cars off the road today.”
The possible workaround
Some vendors are already finding ways around these problems and taking multiple pathways, Abuelsamid said.
They are deploying multiple algorithms instead of just one for perception. Rather than having software rely on cameras, lidar or radar, developers are using them all together. In some cases, vendors use both a deterministic approach and a probabilistic approach in their development of autonomous vehicles.
The deterministic approach is traditional and rules-based, Abuelsamid said. This is when an input signal to the algorithm will always yield the same result and the algorithm’s path is fully traceable.
“This is a well understood and reliable but sometimes limited approach,” Abuelsamid said
The probabilistic or AI approach uses complex models with many parameters that are often determined by the algorithm itself with a training process in which known, labeled data is fed to the algorithm.
The subsets within this category includes machine learning or neural networks. The algorithms will usually produce a probable answer about the likelihood that an object is a pedestrian or a vehicle According to Abuelsamid, the systems tend to be brittle and can sometimes give the wrong response in unexpected ways.
Making algorithms reliable
Most developers are now combining both approaches and breaking their software down into smaller chunks so that even if a specific algorithm can’t be traced, the problem can be isolated.
“By using all of those together, you can mix and match them in different ways so that you can verify what you think the system can verify … and have a more accurate result,” Abuelsamid continued. “Having that redundancy built in really turned out to be really important to have a safe and reliable system.”
Another way vendors are trying to attack this problem is by focusing on one industry. While some vendors zero in on the robotaxi industry, others are looking at the delivery industry.
As some focus on trucking on highways because it’s simpler than driving in the city and doesn’t contain many intersections, others are reining in the scope of their version of autonomous vehicle technology by geography, location or weather conditions.
“What we’re seeing now are companies that are limiting the problem set in some way, and having a limited design domain,” Abuelsamid said.
One autonomous vehicle vendor that has been somewhat successful in constraining the problem set is Motional. Motional transports passengers in Las Vegas through a partnership with Lyft. The company said it has conducted more than 100,000 public rides with two safety drivers in the front seat.
Earlier this year, Motional began testing driverless vehicles in Las Vegas after a two-year safety evaluation period and testing self-driving taxis with a safety driver. The company says it will launch a driverless service in 2023 through its partnership with Lyft, without a safety driver.
The Motional method
Meanwhile, Motional is still working to ensure its technology can handle unpredictable situations without a safety driver.
The vendor is using a machine learning-first approach and a continuous learning framework, said Sammy Omari, vice president of engineering and head of autonomy.
The continuous learning framework automatically detects unusual situations or objects, produces training data automatically in the Motional system and enables engineers and data scientists to retrain quickly and redeploy if the performance evaluation is good enough in simulation.
“This automatic loop allows us to get better, build a better autonomy and handle these kinds of rare situations better with every single mile we drive,” Omari said.
Motional also uses the continuous learning framework to mine for unexpected situations and determine if its prediction system is responding correctly.
If the prediction system does not respond correctly, Omari said, that data is put into the training data that is used to train the model or system. In some cases, the data may also be placed into the model validation set and used to re-create simulation scenarios.
One challenge Motional faces with the continuous learning approach is that it’s working with a large volume of data, as well as hundreds of cars that are out on the road every day.
Processing all that data, pushing it into the cloud and mining for relevant scenarios to create the training and retraining data is also challenging. Another hurdle to overcome is to keep the costs of doing all that for each vehicle under control.
“If you want to pull the safety driver out, you need to have the confidence that you have the right behavior of hundreds or thousands and millions of files,” Omari said.

The world, as we know it today, bears no resemblance whatsoever to the yesteryears. Advancements in technology have disrupted every possible industry and the automotive sector is no stranger to it. There has been an increasing change in the way people look at transportation. In fact, the very term and concept is being shifted from ‘transportation’ to ‘mobility.’ Where traditional transportation was a “system-centric” concept, modern mobility is completely “user-centric,” recognizing the fact that transportation must be responsive to the needs and preferences of commuters and society. Let’s find out why cities should rethink parking as ride-hailing services grows.
Ride-Hailing Services on the Rise
The new concept of shared-use mobility which lies at the centre of New Mobility Services (NMS) allows users access to various modes of transportation – bicycles, motorbikes, and cars – on a short-term and on-demand basis.
Mobility-as-a-service has emerged as a thriving concept with several push forces and enablers responsible for its popularity – one of the main push forces being a millennial aversion to car ownership. And what’s more, is that one of the main reasons the Gen-Z is against car ownership is the stress related to parking.
And the key enablers of ride-hailing services are smartphone applications and smart parking technologies such as IoT working in tandem to connect paying passengers with drivers who offer rides for a certain fee (for their private vehicles).
These ride-hailing services are easy to use and understand. Via a user-friendly smartphone application, the user simply needs to input their drop-off destination (with the pick-up destination either automatically entered through their phone’s GPS or manually entered on the map)and opt for the vehicle type (mini, micro, sedan, etc.) and the ride type (full or share) that best suits their needs and budget and book their ride.
Since these ride-hailing services recommend vehicles that are lurking nearby the pick-up location, the driver generally arrives within minutes of the booking. All that is now left to do is enjoy the ride and make the payment on arrival. How hassle-free is that!
How Cities are Coping with the Revenue Loss
Ever since the concept of mobility-as-a-service has emerged, there has been a bi-directional relationship between it and parking. And why not! After all, one of the top reasons cited for favouring ride-hailing services over car ownership is the increasing stress, hassle, and time and money loss involved in finding a vacant parking spot.
Ride-hailing does alter the parking demand. No longer is parking viewed as a necessary evil, with the degree of its necessity constantly decreasing. With ride-hailing services, people can easily access destinations of their choice without requiring an accompanying parking space. As a result, the demand for parking spaces is seeing a fall. This, in turn, has naturally led to revenue loss for the parking industry.
Cities are compelled to reduce the supply of parking spots and to look for alternative ways of allocating existing, unused parking infrastructure towards other needs and land uses. The diminished value and use of parking infrastructure offer the opportunity to put them to more in-demand and purposeful uses – parks, plazas, and similar elements – that make a city more lively and habitable.
Moreover, the low demand for parking spots owing to lesser driving trips and declining car ownership has proven to be insightful, allowing cities to rethink and better manage curb space – allocating more space for walking and bicycling, and most importantly, monetizing car trips (both private vehicles and ride-sharing vehicles) to cover up the losses incurred. For example – several airports have started charging ride-hailing vehicles a pick-up and drop-off fee for the curb space allotted to them.
Even the rise in mobility services such as ride-hailing can have their downsides – cab-sharing drivers wandering around with no passengers (dead-heading), unnecessary traffic congestions, and decline of sustainable travel options such as walking and bicycling. However, the root of the issue lies in the misuse of spaces – no proper space seems to be available for walking and bicycling.
Hence, the need of the hour is to make cities livable on a human scale with increased space for more sustainable transportation options and to allow technology to adapt to it – a truth more and more cities are waking up to.

Every service has a last mile – that final, physical meeting between consumer and provider. We tend to equate the “last-mile” concept with retail, with the delivery vans that move from distribution center to doorstep.
But healthcare has its last mile – and its last-mile frictions, too. That can mean scheduling the appointments, getting in the car, making one’s way to the doctor or provider – oftentimes dedicating a huge swath of the day to the task.
It’s no secret that the pandemic has forced us all to go online for daily interactions, and that telehealth has been widely adopted. But much of healthcare – such as the preventive efforts that can catch illnesses before they become life-threatening – is tangible, requiring needles, vials, labs and technicians.
We tend to skip appointments for the needed checkups, the blood draws and the other diagnostic tests that are so essential to treatment.
There’s a way to solve the last-mile gap here, as Sprinter Health co-founders Cameron Behar (CTO) and Max Cohen (CEO) told Karen Webster: Bring lab services and testing into the home environment – on demand.
“A lot can be done to solve the problem of access in healthcare,” said Cohen, who posited some key questions about access: “How can we try and get these critical diagnostics, especially these new generations of tests, to patients in a way that’s affordable, accessible, flexible – driving a great patient experience?”
To that end, Sprinter Health announced earlier this month that it has come out of stealth mode with a $33 million investment via Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from General Catalyst, Accel, Google Ventures (GV) and other leading investors.
At a high level, the company said, Sprinter Health addresses the last mile in healthcare by making access to a range of tests and vitals checks as simple as ordering food to be delivered to the home.
In terms of the mechanics, “sprinters” – defined by Cohen and Behar as “tech-savvy phlebotomists” – conduct a range of at-home lab work services at a patient’s home, spanning blood draws, vitals checks, urine sample collection or COVID-19 checks.
The duo said that its technology uses real-time messaging to keep patients apprised about sprinters’ progress. They utilize a “checklist,” said Behar, to complete as services are performed.
Cohen and Behar, with stints at Google and Facebook, come from technology backgrounds, and both had fathers who were doctors. And Cohen, with a long history of suffering from an undiagnosed herniated disk, had firsthand experience with the problems that untreated conditions can cause.
“There’s some amazing technology coming out, but the problem is that it’s not getting in the hands of providers fast enough,” said Cohen. Or providers may have technology in hand, but patients lack access. Individuals may be homebound, or working parents may be unable to schedule time to get to the lab and have blood taken.
That’s a problem in a world where 70% of medical decisions start with a diagnosis, which in turn starts with a lab test. To get a sense of how the tech-enabled, on-demand model can solve for some of the frictions in the last mile of healthcare, Cohen pointed to pre-chemotherapy lab draws.
Cancer patients who travel for treatment have to visit the provider after having blood drawn the day before the treatment. They may be sent home before getting chemo if their white blood cell counts are not satisfactory, he said. But with in-home testing, said Cohen, “you get a text message that we’re on the way, you get a picture of who’s going to be showing up. We come in, and we’re in and out of the house. In under six minutes, we can get that test out” to be examined and confirmed by a physician that same day – paving the way for a timely chemotherapy session.
As Behar and Cohen explained, Sprinter Health can be viewed as an infrastructure play into the healthcare system, serving as connective tissue between patients and providers – at $79 a visit, which is cost-effective compared to in-office visits.
“We’re interested in creating something that helps both the health system to fill that chair, and the patient who doesn’t have to come in and miss work all day for something that ends up not even happening,” Cohen told Webster.
Getting to Scale
The company, which had a $4.6 million funding round in place before the Series A, has been teaming with specialty labs and remains in the early stages of partnering with several health systems as well, forging both a direct-to-consumer and partner-based ecosystem.
Looking ahead, the firm will expand geographically beyond California into Texas, Florida and other states. As the company scales, the duo said, it will look for a subset of the phlebotomist population that is comfortable with technology, with an eye on the fact that certification (to conduct the tests) can vary from state to state. A further goal is to have clusters of patients within cities and towns, which makes the sprinters’ journeys most cost-effective. Eventual payment models will include patient payments (the current model), co-pay and partner pay, said Cohen.
As Behar pointed out, though there has been tremendous growth in the telehealth space, “we know that they’re fundamentally going to be limited by the number of services they can offer with actual hands in the home. We’re hoping to be those kinds of clinical extenders for services like theirs – so they can actually help diagnose an ear infection by looking in your ear. They can actually look in your eyes and get those necessary diagnostics beyond blood draws.”

The VoloDrone in actionVolocopterVIEW 3 IMAGES
Better known for its work developing audacious 18-rotor flying taxis to solve congestion in city centers, Volocopter is adapting its expertise in electric aviation for the purposes of moving heavy cargo. Its giant VoloDrone has now completed its very first public flight, demonstrating how it can safely transport large loads with the help of cargo bikes and play a key role in an all-electric multi-mode delivery system.
Since introducing the VoloDrone in 2019, Volocopter has carried out regular test flights in closed airfields around Germany. Like the Volocopter itself, the giant drone uses 18 rotors, a battery and electric motors to hoist itself into the air, using a rail attachment system in between its landing gear to carry payloads of up to 200 kg (440 lb) over a 40-km (24-mile) range.
On Tuesday, the VoloDrone carried out its first simulated delivery in the public arena, with the exercise undertaken together with logistics firm DB Schenker. This took place as part of ITS World Congress 2021 in Hamburg, and began with the team securing a load to the VoloDrone’s undercarriage.
The aircraft then took off, reaching an altitude of 22 m (72 ft) and carrying the load over a three-minute flight to a nearby carpark, where it came down to land safely. From there, electric cargo bikes were used to transfer the load to its destination beneath a nearby decking.
“This first public VoloDrone flight is a strong sign for Volocopter´s leading position in the UAM (urban air mobility) industry,” says Florian Reuter, CEO of Volocopter. “We are the only UAM company offering solutions for passengers and goods that are flying fully scaled and publicly around the world. Our VoloDrone will make existing logistics processes more robust, efficient, and sustainable. DB Schenker is an invaluable partner in our endeavor to untap the massive potential of our VoloDrone’s logistics use cases.”
As it continues carrying out test flights of the VoloDrone along with its passenger aircraft, Volocopter is working on the infrastructure side of things to support the operations of these vehicles. These could take the shape of so-called VoloPort networks where the vehicles can land, swap batteries and pick up people and cargo. The company says today it is planning to launch these sometime in the next two or three years, though there’ll be regulations and a certification process for it to navigate before a proper lift-off.

Transportation systems traditionally favour suburban, upwardly mobile users over those from lower-income groups and neighbourhoods.Emerging technology – AI in particular – can help to address this issue.Safe, equitable transportation is within our reach, but we still have a lot of work to do.
Amidst our current reckoning with structural racism, gender bias and unequal access to education and economic opportunity, the transportation industry has a responsibility to acknowledge its own contributions to these inequities. We also have an opportunity to begin to address them – through more considered choices going forward, and, excitingly, with the help of new technology. If these solutions also enhance safety and lower risk for all road users, and if they produce fewer emissions while using our planet’s resources more efficiently, we as a society will have achieved a rare triple-win.
New transit models will democratize safe transportation moving forward. Historically, transit design – and the interstate system in particular – has catered to suburban, upwardly mobile groups, while exacerbating the socioeconomic divide and limiting access to opportunity for those most in need. A recent Harvard studydemonstrated that transportation is the single largest determinant of social mobility. Lack of access can lead to less opportunity, more dependence on (often subpar) public transportation, and longer commute times. Ideally, transit networks should open up a city to all those who live within its proximity, not create mobility and economic hurdles.
Although the link between social mobility and access to transportation is troubling, even more so is how disproportionately low-income communities experience the effects of traffic-related fatalities; for example, those walking in lower-income metropolitan areas have twice the fatality rates of those walking in other neighbourhoods. Transit design in low-income communities is often not optimized for safety to the same extent as in more affluent communities. For instance, low-income communities often lack safe sidewalks and biking infrastructure, while also suffering from higher traffic volumes and higher-speed roadways. This safety disparity costs lives and is one of the most critical problems the transportation industry needs to address: bringing safe mobility to everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status.
Have you read?
When I began exploring autonomous vehicles more than a decade ago as a graduate student at Stanford University, I was excited about the challenges involved. Robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, cars, behavioural economics, psychology and more, all combined into two deep questions: first, how can we solve this incredibly complex technical problem; and second, how can we rethink transportation in cities if people don’t have to drive their own cars?
As I learned more about the needs of people in cities, another topic surfaced, too: the extent of the discrepancy in people’s ability to get from point A to point B. In aggregate, taxi drivers (of all races) preferentially pick up white passengers. Residents of underserved communities often have to spend hours commuting on multiple bus routes or biking along streets with cars zipping by at more than 40 miles per hour. Sometimes there are no sidewalks.
These hurdles make people’s lives harder. Through this lens, developing autonomous vehicles is even more than an exciting technical, economic, safety and environmental challenge; it’s a people issue, too. How can we find ways for everyone – regardless of their socioeconomic status or where they live in a city – to safely and efficiently go where they want?

Often when confronted with massive societal-level problems like these, we turn to the government for answers or solutions. No doubt, they have a critical role to play in almost all pieces of the puzzle. But changing laws, societal norms, and decades-old programmes can take a long time at best, and sometimes there are so many stakeholders, different opinions, and inability (or unwillingness) to pay, that genuine change feels out of reach. So it’s exciting when new technologies and associated business models emerge that can play a part in solving the hardest problems.
AI comes with its own challenges – but it absolutely can and will play a role in bringing safe, clean, and affordable transportation models to our roadways. Most public transit systems require significant capital investments in infrastructure and are typically designed to accommodate the greatest need (which, itself, is subject to opinion and bias). The challenge, then, is that services like trains and bus lines are restricted to just the number of stops and areas they can serve. As a city grows and evolves, the public transit systems often remain the same – becoming inaccessible to those who rely on it the most.
Amidst the rigidity of public transportation, we have the so-called last-mile problem: a situation where travelers are often not able to reach their exact destination, but are able to get within a few miles or so. Taxis, ridehailing, scooters, biking and walking are all possible solutions, but there can be financial, safety, or practical barriers associated with these. Many individuals purchase a car specifically to avoid public transportation, or don’t have access to it in the first place.

Demand for mobility-as-a-service has grown steadily over the past decade, especially in cities. This model brings many benefits, and at its best, can be genuinely complimentary to public transportation – but it has also left some people behind. Traditional ridehailing services can be unpredictable, especially with surge pricing and the recent shortage of drivers.
While modern-day ridehailing services have partially democratized the personal chauffeur, there are overhead costs that are passed on to the riders: for example, the expenses to pay drivers a living wage or the cost to cover deadheading (the term for when a vehicle is underutilized and drives around without charging for its miles). And while most drivers are safe and courteous with clean and well-maintained vehicles, unfortunately, that’s not always the case.MOBILITY
What is the World Economic Forum doing about mobility?
Show
With new technologies, we can build a more affordable and inclusive transportation system for even more of our communities. Our vehicles will be meaningfully safer than their human-driven counterparts. Over time, they will cost much less to use. They’ll create less pollution and use fewer resources, because they’re utilized all day and night long. Within their geofence, they won’t discriminate based on race or socioeconomic status. They’ll be reliably clean and well maintained. And they’ll be a pleasure to ride in, having been designed for exactly that.
The potential societal benefits are tremendous, but we still have a long and capital-intensive road ahead. Along this journey, there will be challenges; we certainly won’t solve everything for everyone right away. But we couldn’t be more excited to help address some of society’s oldest issues by dismantling historic transportation hurdles and bringing safe, clean and enjoyable transportation to everyone.

The trusty delivery van may be the most common form of last mile delivery in cities around the world, but its position atop the throne is now being challenged by an unlikely competitor: the humble electric cargo bicycle.
Cargo e-bikes are similar to most electric bicycles in that they feature an assist motor and battery to help the rider travel faster and farther. But unlike most electric bicycles, cargo e-bikes have longer, more robust frames designed to carry significantly larger loads and sometimes even additional passengers.
A new study has found that in urban areas, electric cargo bicycles make deliveries 60% faster than delivery vans.
While delivery vans may be capable of carrying more packages, they are much less efficient at actually making deliveries.
The study found that electric cargo bikes were capable of making 10 deliveries per hour on average in urban areas, while delivery vans recorded just 6 deliveries in the same period.
The major factor was the increased average speed of delivery e-bikes. They were able to utilize bicycle lanes and thus avoid getting bogged down in traffic. Larger delivery vans don’t have the same luxury, ultimately spending much more time waiting in traffic.
The study also found that cargo electric bicycles didn’t just get deliveries done faster, they also performed the job much more cleanly.
Compared to diesel vans, the cargo e-bikes cut emissions by 90%. Even compared to electric vans, cargo e-bikes had 30% fewer emissions.
While electric delivery vans are slowly becoming more commonplace, they still can’t compete with cargo e-bikes on efficiency or emissions.
They’re a huge improvement over fossil fuel-powered vans, but they use more energy to make deliveries and they get bogged down in traffic just the same.
The speed and efficiency advantages of electric cargo bikes have been exploited by a number of industries.
E-bike maker Tern recently teamed up with Dutch-X to combine the latter’s NYC delivery service with the former’s heavy duty electric cargo bikes.
Third party logistics companies such as UPS, FedEx and DHL have employed cargo e-bikes to increase the speed and efficiency of package deliveries in urban areas.
Hospitals have used cargo e-bikes as mini-ambulances to more quickly deliver EMTs and their life-saving first aid to emergency sites.
And cargo e-bikes are even being used by entrepreneurs to operate food trucks and ice-cream vans on smaller, cheaper and more sustainable platforms.
Electrek’s Take
I file this one in the ‘duh’ category.
Cargo e-bikes simply make so much sense. I’ve always had a thing for e-bikes that can carry more than one person, and cargo e-bikes combine that shared fun factor with extreme utility for carrying cargo/groceries/supplies/deliveries/etc.
They have the ability to replace so many types of vehicles.
Think you need a minivan to move apartments? I’ve done it on a cargo e-bike.
Think you need a truck to make a lumber run to your local home improvement store? I’ve done it on a cargo e-bike.
Think you need an SUV to haul all the kids to school? I’ve done it on a cargo e-bike.
Think you need a van to pick up a new bike? Mikey’s done it on a cargo e-bike.
There’s just so much utility to be had with a cargo electric bike. What’s not to like?!

A smart city has billions of connected devices and systems. This includes smart street lighting, pedestrian management, road management, waste management, air/noise quality monitoring, smart medical systems etc. Enormous volumes of data will be generated for security, productivity and the quality of life of the citizens. A unified data management framework is imperative for the smooth functioning of a smart city. However, storing and processing such massive amounts of data via the internet will put tremendous pressure on networks and make a dent in the city’s funds. The best solution to this would be to store data locally for easy and immediate access. This is usually done with edge computing.
Understanding Edge Computing
Unlike the standard internet model that relies heavily upon cloud technology services provided by Google, Microsoft, etc., edge computing is a complementary model where the processing of information and its storage is done at the very edge of the network. This means that the information under edge computing is stored as close as possible to the end-points of a network and the devices it is servicing.
This method of processing and storage of data lets organizations render services even when there is no internet connectivity and enabling localized data processing.
Since edge computing makes it possible to develop applications without an internet connection, the installed multiple edge servers will form a network, enabling apps and services to run locally at the edge as opposed to it running on a central cloud platform. As a result, autonomous operations can be performed even when backhaul coverage is lost and lower latency will be required since applications are located nearer to the data source. An open platform will be freely available for third-party developers to develop new applications.
The Need for Edge Computing for Smarter Cities
Smart city development pilots and projects have been replaced with more wide-scale deployments. The concept of a smart city has the IoT (Internet of Things) as a foundation – a network of connected devices offering easy and real-time data exchange for the efficient management of services.
Common examples of IoT deployment include tracking of buses, traffic light and signage management, control of street lighting, refuse monitoring, air quality control, etc.
There are several operational benefits to such deployments. However, too many applications lead to the formation of a large number of data streams, generating the risk of network overloading issues. If these data streams are forced to remain in connection with cloud-based data centres.
The wireless network on which the connectivity of the data sensors depends upon – 5G – is still in a precarious state, even in developed countries. 5G may be the panacea to all network infrastructural problems, but there are only a few widespread commercial deployments of it as of now. There are few proper use cases that justify its costs.
The technology of edge computing can lead not only to operational cost savings but also to an unlimited range of smart apps that can be managed through a single platform, as opposed to siloing it across management devices.
Edge Computing in Everyday Life
Here’s how edge computing technology can improve things in our daily lives:
Street Lights
Smart street lights are growing in popularity, as a result of which there is a rising demand for networking, computing, and storage resources. What smart streetlights need is a highly scalable system that can facilitate easy migration, fast deployment, and high resource utilization. Many cities are replacing their sodium street lights with LED-powered ones. Edge computing provides lighting controls and a means for deploying a universal platform on which other smart apps can also be developed.
Security CCTV Cameras
Today’s smart cameras can be made ‘conscious’ using edge computing to recognize objects and faces. Low-cost and straightforward wireless IP cameras on the market today from which footage can be stored locally in edge for easy and immediate access. This would help save on backhaul costs.
Connected Parking Meters
Edge computing is also being used to deploy smart parking meters, where such systems can be monitored on demand. The data will be transmitted to a central database only in case of a fault, for easy local access.
High-Bandwidth Messaging Services
Edge computing can help provide a high-bandwidth messaging platform that can run without a connection to the internet on standard smartphones and tablets. City workers can use this high-resilient local area network for quick exchange of information.
While smart cities pose a challenge with the vast volumes of data that they will generate and the billions of smart devices that will need to stay connected to each other at all times. Thankfully, edge computing can effectively deal with these problems by offering smooth operation without internet connectivity, enhancing security as the processes are limited to the “edge,” lowering operating costs, and reducing risk with compliances.

The National Science Foundation (NSF), in partnership with the Department of Energy, has awarded a $1 million Stage 2 Civic Innovation Challenge grant to a team led by A. Russell Chandler III Chair and Professor Pascal Van Hentenryck to pilot an On-Demand Multimodal Transit System (ODMTS) in Atlanta. The goal of the project is to make public transportation in Atlanta faster, more convenient, and more equitable for the city’s residents, especially in underserved communities.
According to Van Hentenryck, who also leads the Socially Aware Mobility Lab, mass transit has a significant first- and last-mile problem: Most people will only walk a quarter of a mile to and from public transportation. If the distance exceeds this threshold, ridership decreases by more than 90%. To address this, Van Hentenryck’s team has created an ODMTS, which uses small on-demand vehicles, in addition to buses and light rail, to take riders to and from their destinations. The on-demand vehicles act as feeders to and from the fixed routes, allowing the transit system to be essentially door-to-door.
Van Hentenryck, a world leader in the fields of artificial intelligence, data science, and operations research, began to tackle the first- and last-mile problems in mobility eight years ago in Canberra, Australia. He then conducted another successful case study in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In both midsized cities, the multi-modal approach resulted in a significant reduction in both cost and passenger wait times. In 2018, Van Hentenryck joined ISyE, shifted his focus to Atlanta, and began a collaboration with the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA). This winter, after more than three years of preparation, the team plans to pilot ODMTS in Atlanta areas with limited public transportation.
While ODMTS will improve the performance and efficiency of public transportation for everyone in Atlanta, the main objective is to provide cost-effective transportation to underserved communities and connect residents in underserved communities to jobs, healthcare, education, and healthy food. The ODMTS pilot will run in MARTA’s four jurisdictions: Clayton, DeKalb, and Fulton counties, and the City of Atlanta.
“It is almost impossible to do this with a traditional system, because these areas are very large and sparsely populated,” said Van Hentenryck. “It is not feasible to put buses in these areas, because they would run empty most of the time, and they require significant capital expenditures. On-demand vehicles, however, are inexpensive to operate and can reach a larger population, because they can be deployed as needed rather than following a set route.”
Though this is not the team’s first pilot, tackling a city like Atlanta is no small feat. Most of the algorithms used in Canberra and Ann Arbor had to be completely rewritten to account for Atlanta’s size and rail system, a component not part of the previous pilots. This creates a four-level system — trains, buses, on-demand vehicles, and walking — to get passengers to and from their locations.
“Atlanta is also a complicated city because it has multiple job centers. In addition to downtown, there are centers in Midtown, Gwinnett, Alpharetta, Buckhead, and near the airport,” said Van Hentenryck. “This makes for a much more complex design since we are taking people from their homes to one of many locations for work.”
Tickets will cost the same as the traditional MARTA system, just $2.50 each way, and riders will be able to purchase fare using the Breeze system. The team is also using a combination of machine learning and optimization techniques to predict rider behavior and ensure the system can scale accordingly.
“If we decrease transit time by 40%, more people will adopt transit because now it is much faster and more convenient than it used to be,” explained Van Hentenryck. “This will increase the demand, so it is important that we size the system correctly to account for this.”
ODMTS will also help decrease traffic congestion in Atlanta and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by enabling more people to use public transportation in place of personal vehicles. The addition of on-demand vehicles will also create jobs since additional drivers will be necessary to operate them. No existing bus routes will be eliminated during the pilot.
Collaboration Leads to Success
“MARTA’s leadership is very forward thinking, and they are working to determine the future of public transportation,” said Van Hentenryck. “They have been extremely collaborative throughout the process and provided us with vast amounts of data and insights to drive the process.”
“We are grateful to the National Science Foundation for this grant and proud to partner with Georgia Tech,” said MARTA Deputy General Manager Collie Greenwood. “Exploring first- and last-mile connectivity options is important in providing transit service that meets the needs of everyone in metro Atlanta.” 
In addition to Van Hentenryck, the Georgia Tech team that will pilot ODMTS in Atlanta includes Professor Subhrajit “Subhro” Guhathakurta in the School of City and Regional Planning, Executive Director for Partnership and Inclusive Innovation Debra Lam, Associate Professor Christopher Le Dantec in the School of Interactive Computing, and Frederick Law Olmsted Associate Professor Kari Watkins in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
The research team will partner directly with residents in pilot communities, as well as with the transportation advocacy organization Atlanta Bicycle Coalition, to ensure transit services and access address the real-world needs of underserved locations.
“Our long history of working directly with Atlanta communities, and with local partners like the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition, will help us embed local expertise into the design of last-mile transit service for under-served locations in the city,” said Le Dantec.
The Stage 2 Civic Innovation Challenge grant is the latest in a series of awards to bring ODMTS to Atlanta. The team received the NSF Leap HI (Leading Engineering for America’s Prosperity, Health, and Infrastructure) grant in 2019 in collaboration with the School of Civil Engineering, School of Urban Planning, MARTA, the Atlanta Regional Commission, and the City of Atlanta to scale the algorithms used in Canberra and Ann Arbor with hopes to eventually pilot the program in Atlanta. They were then awarded a Stage 1 Civic Innovation Challenge planning grant in January 2021 to model the mobility patterns in Atlanta in preparation for a pilot in Stage 2.
“Professor Van Hentenryck deserves much credit for having the foresight to bring multidisciplinary, applied research and external partners together to catalyze innovative responses to regional and urban mobility,” Lam said. “We are excited to explore how this can be modeled for other communities for greater economic and social growth.”
Of the 52 teams selected for Stage 1, only 17 were chosen to move forward with pilot projects in Stage 2. They will have 12 months to complete and evaluate their projects.
“We applaud the efforts of all the teams who worked tirelessly to build partnerships between researchers and community stakeholders” said NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. “We are excited to see the teams selected for the next phase begin their pilot projects and plant seeds of innovation across the country. This program demonstrates the value of research-community partnerships in rapidly translating cutting-edge science into community-based innovation, and we look forward to seeing its positive impact across urban and rural communities.”
Van Hentenryck is eager to implement the pilot. “For me, this is the most successful research that you can have,” he said. “We started more than three years ago with an idea and now we get to make a difference in the lives of people.”
About the Socially Aware Mobility Project
The Socially Aware Mobility project is poised to have tremendous impact on the Metro Atlanta area, revolutionizing and modernizing the transit system for the 21st century. Funded in part by a grant by the National Science Foundation, the project aims to bring equitable accessibility, decreased congestion, and increased mobility to all users of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA). Through optimization and machine learning, the project will create a scalable, On-Demand Multimodal Transit System model, which will be validated through implementation in the Atlanta region. By providing solutions to increase mobility while simultaneously decreasing congestion, the project stands to have significant impact on how Atlantans navigate around the community.

If you are looking to expand your sales territory and have not yet put Latin America on your bill of lading, you’re missing a golden opportunity. Latin America offers the fastest-growing regional e-commerce marketplace in the world.
You do not think so? Well, think again. Last year, the total retail e-commerce sales to the LATAM region grew 36.7 percent to $84.95 billion. That is still growing this year.
Among the larger individual economies in the region, Argentina was the fastest growing, with a retail e-commerce increase rate of 79 percent. Brazil’s e-commerce growth rate was 35 percent, while Mexico’s was 27 percent.
“Normally, our holiday rush begins in November. Last year it started in July, and basically never ended,” said A.J. Hernandez, president and CEO of international business-to-consumer shipping firm SkyPostal.
The pandemic increased shipping volumes to Christmas levels in July all over the world as well as throughout Latin America. With the approach of summer, Hernandez sees a continued growth trend as the region works to vaccinate the population.
“I do not believe that there will be a leveling off now that people are more comfortable with online shopping,” he predicted.
Marketing Basics
Hernandez, whose firm is widely recognized as the industry leader in Latin American shipping and delivery logistics, noted that Latin America is, in addition to being a rapidly growing e-commerce market, one of the world’s most complex economic regions.
South America consists of 33 individual countries and an additional 15 dependencies and territories. Populations range in size, with Brazil the largest at 212.6 million people. The Falkland Islands comprise the smallest with just less than 3,500 people.
Most of these countries support their own currencies and have their own taxation and customs authorities. They have their own postal systems, too. But they are widely regarded as unreliable. So you will have to be a bit creative in handling the last mile of delivery.
“U.S.-based companies have to understand the local flavor. The last-mile delivery is key to success. This means partnering with local delivery service providers as well as hiring local leaders,” Ray Wang, a principal analyst at Constellation Research, told the E-Commerce Times.
Latin America has seen the acceleration of digital all across the board. The e-commerce market has seen five years of accelerated transformation in one year, Wang offered about the existing potential for sales growth.
“In Latin America, we have seen innovations in last-mile delivery services, more use of buy online pick up at the curb, and even improvements in payments and apps,” he added.
E-Commerce Market Maker
The pandemic introduced many people to online shopping as it became a necessity. Prior to the pandemic, adoption was not as high in the region as it was in the U.S., Canada, Asia, and Europe, according to Hernandez.
But the pandemic changed the e-commerce landscape considerably in Latin America. The market growth elsewhere as a percentage was not as impressive, since those regions already had higher adoption rates. Yet their volume increases were just as high.
Product offerings are ripe for the picking among Latin American consumers. Many categories of products are globally sought after. Then there are “niche” or hard-to-get items that are not as easy to get as in other markets, Hernandez noted.
That makes an opening that U.S.-based vendors should take. Successful marketers do not need to overdo e-commerce technology. Rather, they should utilize tech to better facilitate the logistical challenges.
For instance, U.S.-based vendors should identify products that are not readily available in the local markets or are very costly. They find a way to make these products available for shoppers supported by a strong logistics network to manage the deliveries, suggested Hernandez.
“Fifty-two million people in that region are expected to make their first online purchase during the pandemic, which could create an increase of up to 30 percent in online consumers in some Latin American countries,” said Hernandez.
What’s more, the Latin American market is expected to grow more than eight percent and reach a market value of $200 billion, he added.
Overcoming Obstacles
U.S.-based marketers and vendors need to be proactive to enter this marketplace. Obstacles do exist but are not insurmountable.
For instance, the number of consumers venturing online to shop lack physical bank accounts. That is a key challenge, remarked Constellation Research’s Wang.
“One opportunity is to leverage the mobile operators who can extend credit on the phone bill or improve sign up of microcredit services,” he offered.
Past issues involving e-commerce for consumers in the Latin America region have long existed, added Hernandez. But a shift in consumer attitudes in starting to improve the damaged online trust factor.
Build Trust or No Sale
Before the pandemic, Latin American consumers fell on the wrong side of the trust barrier. Many feared putting their credit card information online. That also included American citizens reticent to do business with Latin America for fear of credit card fraud.
Covid-19’s arrival shut local stores. Latin American consumers had no choice but to change their trust issues. Now, a new level of confidence is evident that will sustain the region’s growth in e-commerce even after the pandemic has lifted.
“Positive experiences with online shopping have done a lot to erode the underlying mistrust that has always been prevalent in Latin America,” Hernandez said.
Whether it was concern about having a credit card number stolen, or never receiving ordered products, those issues are less of a barrier. Now that Latin American consumers have tried it and found that it works, they trust the process, he added.
Challenges and Technology
The biggest challenge businesses face when expanding to Latin American consumers is that each country has its own set of rules. It is important that businesses work with experts who are familiar with the region to help them avoid the pitfalls that have caused other businesses to fail, recommended Hernandez.
Also, do not sell logistics short. Logistics is as much about delivering data as it is about delivering packages.
Sellers want data. They want to know where their packages are when they are delivered, and if there are any challenges.
“Online visibility is critical, as are data services, to help sellers provide critical information necessary to import goods such as tax ID numbers and HS Codes,” he explained.
In addition, the technology used to correct errors in the initial shipment data and validating postal codes is also critical to success.
Navigating the Shipping and Selling Lanes
The growth in e-commerce and logistical capabilities needed will still require merchants’ keen attentiveness in tapping into the overall Latin American retail economy. To successfully navigate that course, U.S.-based merchants use specialists in Latin American logistics to handle their shipping.
For example, SkyPostal is actually an IT company focused on package delivery. It provides its clients API-based solutions that coordinate their own checkout systems with all the necessary delivery data. The company also offers services in the U.S., Canada, and Europe through partners with similar expertise.
Rather than struggle with setting up a fine-tuned web presence for selling your wares to Latin America’s consumers, consider using an already existing online sales marketplace with built-in selling expertise.
Mercado Libre, known as the “Amazon of Latin America,” has operations in 18 countries throughout the region, is the fourth largest online marketplace in the world, and the largest in Latin America in terms of visits per month. Its top markets are Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico.
Another option for handling localized shipping is ShipStation; which has a partnership with Mercado Libre. That could be a big help to U.S.-based SMBs looking to break into selling to the Latin American marketplace with a package deal.
ShipStation offers shipping software and also has partnerships with more than 300 leading shopping cart, carriers, and fulfillment services. These include FedEx, UPS, the United States Postal Service, Amazon, Shopify, and BigCommerce.

Chinese
 technology company Baidu Inc. is one of the world’s leading developers 
of autonomous driving technology with its open Apollo platform. In 
addition to developing an entire mobility ecosystem in China around self-driving vehicles,
 the company is working directly with three of China’s biggest 
automakers to install its autonomous driving hardware during the 
production phase, as opposed to modifying the vehicles after assembly. 
The
 vehicles are being mass produced by the three of China leading 
automakers, GAC, WM Motor and SAIC Group, to serve as robotaxis for 
Baidu’s “Apollo Go” ride-hailing service.
On Oct 26, Baidu launched the third of these “Apollo Moon”  robotaxis based on an electric SUV from AION, the new electric  sub-brand of Chinese automaker GAC which launched in 2018. The EV comes  with Baidu’s factory-installed autonomous driving system and is referred  to by Baidu as the “Apollo Moon AION version”.
The
 Apollo Moon AION SUV is built on the latest version of GAC’s GEP (GAC 
Electric Platform), which is designed for purely electric vehicles. It 
will accelerate the application of L4 autonomous driving and drive the 
era of shared mobility, according to Baidu.
“The  launch of Apollo Moon is an important breakthrough signifying the  powerful linkage between China’s leading autonomous driving technology  and the most advanced smart vehicle platform, marking a landmark step in  the field of robotaxi ride-hailing services globally,” said Li Zhenyu,  senior vice-president at Baidu.
The AION 
robotaxi is the third production vehicle from three different automakers
 that Baidu has added its autonomous driving hardware to. The other two 
are the Apollo Moon Arcfox from automaker BAIC Group’s electric sub 
brand Arcfox, which was released in June, and the Apollo Moon WM Motor, 
which is based on the W6 SUV from chinese automaker WM Motor. The W6 was
 officially launched on Oct 19.
The W6 from
 WM Motor is equipped with 12 cameras, 5 millimeter-wave radars and 12 
ultrasonic radars with L2+ autonomous driving capabilities. Baidu says 
its Apollo platform supports autonomous driving in dense urban areas as 
well as highway driving. 
Integrating 
Baidu’s Apollo autonomous driving technology in a production vehicle 
involved an R&D investment of 3 billion yuan ($469.91 million), 
according to Chinese news outlet Gasgoo. The platform features both autonomous driving software and hardware integration.
The
 Apollo Moon AION includes a customer-built LiDAR unit, a fully 
redundant design for added safety. If any sensors fail, the entire 
vehicle still executes autonomous driving commands and delivers 
passengers to a safe dropoff location.
Since  its based on a dedicated EV platform that supports better hardware  integration, the Apollo Moon AION features lower manufacturing cost per  car than that of the former-generation cars, while its overall  autonomous driving capabilities have been improved.
Baidu’s  Apollo Moon vehicles also use its “ANP-Robotaxi” architecture, which  can reduce the weight of autonomous vehicle hardware. The platform can  be used to share intelligent driving vehicle data with other Apollo Moon  vehicles to create a closed-loop information ecosystem that allows for  level-4 autonomous driving, which has not yet been achieved by the  industry. 
Apollo Moon also includes a 
precise failure detector and degradable processing algorithms, 
5G-powered remote monitoring services and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology.
Baidu plans to work with other automakers in the future to install its autonomous driving system in a higher number of vehicles at the factory. Baidu plans to have its Apollo intelligent driving solutions available in more than one million vehicles in the next three to five years, said Li Zhenyu, senior corporate vice president at Baidu, during a presentation in April at Auto Shanghai 2021.
Baidu’s Approach to Self-Driving Differs From Tesla and Waymo in the U.S.
Baidu’s  approach in the development of its self-driving technology differs from  that of Tesla and Alphabet’s autonomous driving division Waymo, which  spun out of Google’s self-driving car project. 
Speaking
 at the Emerging Engineering International Forum 2021, hosted by Peking 
University last week, Baidu CEO Robin Li spoke about the engineering 
mindset that drives Baidu’s business.
In 
his speech, Li shared his thoughts on how competitors like Waymo and 
Tesla approach the development of autonomous driving technology compared
 to Baidu. 
According to Li, Waymo’s  approach is a “scientific one”, aiming to achieve L5 first, then  expanding, scaling and commercializing the technology. Tesla however,  has taken an “engineering approach”, by gradually making incremental  advances in its self-driving technology. Baidu has instead prioritized  expanding the driving range of self-driving vehicles, by perfecting the  technology in a smaller geo-fenced area before expanded to a wider  region.
Li said in his speech that its 
impossible to deploy a self-driving car on the road and immediately be 
able to drive all 5 million kilometers of road in China. He says there 
are many factors that need to be tested and considered prior to 
achieving the highest level of safety for autonomous vehicles. 
By
 practicing the operation of self-driving cars in smaller areas where 
the conditions are more conducive to testing, Baidu argues that its able
 to gradually learn and improve its autonomous driving capabilities 
before expanding to a wider geographical area.
Baidu
 is often referred to as the “Google of China”, has been working to 
deploy commercial autonomous driving technology at scale as part of its 
open Apollo platform since 2017. The Apollo platform is designed to 
speed up the development of self-driving technology through 
collaboration with industry partners.
Since
 its launch, Apollo’s development work has grown significantly. Baidu is
 working with over 200 industry partners as part of Apollo, including 
automakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen, and hardware manufacturers Intel
 and Nvidia.
The Apollo platform is often 
referred to as the “Android of the Automotive Industry.” It’s the 
largest open-source autonomous driving platform in the world, according 
to Baidu. 
Baidu called the integration of 
its autonomous driving technology in the three Apollo Moon robotaxis “a 
monumental milestone in the large-scale commercialization of fully 
autonomous ride-hailing services in China.”
During
 the company’s annual Baidu World 2021 conference in August, Li unveiled
 his vision for mobility of the future in the form of a futuristic 
“robocar” designed to make autonomous vehicles more accessible to the 
broader public. 
The robocar features automated gull-wing doors and a transparent glass roof to  make the interior feel more spacious for passengers. Each vehicle  includes a suite of external sensors for safe navigation on public  streets. Baidu says its robocar is capable of level 5 autonomous  driving, meaning that no human intervention is ever required.
The  over design of the robocar is bold and differs from traditional vehicle  designs, with no steering wheel, pedals or other controls for a human  operator.

 Autonomous tech could lead to deaths at the hands of robots. But is continuing to let humans drive even worse? 
By Rani Molla
LaBystLast year saw a jump in the number of car fatalities, even as the pandemic kept many Americans off the roads. The number of deaths per 100 million miles driven grew 24 percent from a year earlier. It was the biggest single-year rise on record — and 2021 is on track to be just as bad. At the same time, the promise of autonomous cars has never been closer. Waymo and Tesla are continually improving their autonomous capabilities, drawing the tantalizing prospect of markedly less human suffering ever nearer. But getting to that future is complicated.
The decision to switch to autonomous vehicles presents a very modern take on an old ethical dilemma: the famed trolley problem.
This thought experiment involves a trolley car driver on a collision course with a group of pedestrians. The driver can do nothing and kill several people on the track ahead or take action, switching tracks so that just one person dies. These days, doing nothing means that about 1.3 million people will die each year globally in regular car accidents, the leading cause of death in people under 30. Switching tracks would involve more rapidly developing and adopting autonomous vehicles that could eventually prevent thousands of deaths per day. The problem is that the technology has a long way to go before it can drive people safely on its own in everyday conditions. In the meantime, it could lead to deaths at the hands of robots, if not humans.
Waymo and Tesla are at the forefront of the driverless car push and thus have a front seat to this dilemma. Both have similar goals — to safely transport people in autonomous vehicles — but they are operating with wildly different strategies.
Waymo, which shares a parent company with Google, is slowly and methodically rolling out its autonomous vehicles in the form of a robo-taxi service. The company boasts it has logged well over 20 million miles of autonomous driving without a single death. But currently, regular people can only ride in one of several hundred Waymo vehicles, in sunny Phoenix. Last week, the company got permission to launch its taxi service (with a human monitor behind the wheel) in a second city — San Francisco — where hills, weather, and traffic complicate the task. The company eventually plans to launch in other cities and license its automated driver technology to car manufacturers. But Waymo doesn’t know when that will happen because, as its co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana told Kara Swisher at the September 2021 Code Conference, the company is “in the process of learning.”
“It’s, I would say, the engineering challenge of our generation. That’s what’s taking it so long,” Mawakana said. “Safety takes time.”
In the meantime, people will continue to die in car accidents, with 94 percent of fatal car crashes caused by human error.
Tesla, on the other hand, has rolled out autonomous features much more quickly. In September, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that drivers with a record of safe driving and who paid for the feature could request permission to beta test its “Full Self-Driving” technology. It includes more advanced driver assistance featuresthan Autopilot, Tesla’s existing semi-autonomous feature, which helps drivers steer, brake, and accelerate within a lane.The company claims that the hardware — but not the software, which is still being tested — in new Teslas is capable of “full self-driving in almost all circumstances” and is “designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat.” According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there are currently no fully automated or self-driving cars for sale, and such technology is years away.
The head of the National Transportation Safety Board has said that Tesla should fix existing safety deficiencies before rolling out the new tech. Meanwhile, other Tesla critics say that names like “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving” cause people to place more faith in the technology than they should, erroneously taking their hands off the wheel or not paying attention.
This dissonance has resulted in tragedy. In August, the NHTSA opened a formal investigation into Autopilot after crashes involving Teslas and emergency vehicles (12 so far). The agency has also opened special investigations into accidents suspected to have happened while advanced driver assistance systems were engaged and which have resulted in 12 deaths.
Musk maintains that, despite the deaths, these cars are 10 times safer than regular cars.
“Even if you, for argument’s sake, reduce fatalities by 90 percent with autonomy, the 10 percent that do die with autonomy are still gonna sue you,” Musk told Swisher at Code. “The 90 percent that are living don’t even know that that’s the reason they’re alive.”
There’s some truth to that. By taking humans out of the equation, autonomous cars have the potential to save lives and alleviate incalculable social and economic losses. As NHTSA put it, “Fully automated vehicles that can see more and act faster than human drivers could greatly reduce errors, the resulting crashes, and their toll.”
The key is getting to that future quickly without jeopardizing it by causing the very harm you’re attempting to stop.
Two roads traveled
If the goal is to get autonomous driving assistance to the masses, Tesla is closer. If the goal is to have cars that safely drive themselves, Waymo is winning.
“Tesla is doing high-altitude flights or near-space flights, and Waymo is landing on the moon,” Mike Ramsey, vice president at research firm Gartner, told Recode. “One is trying to achieve something that’s far harder to do than the other. But that’s not to say that the high-altitude flights can’t keep getting higher and higher.”
In other words, while Tesla probably won’t be delivering a fully autonomous vehicle anytime soon — despite its misleading naming — it could incrementally get better and better assistance features that would eventually lead to true self-driving capabilities.
Tesla vehicles are considered to be at level 2 on the engineering society SAE International’s automation scale. That means Tesla’s system requiresconstant driver supervision, even if the assistance features are handling some of the steering and braking. Waymo vehicles are level 4, meaning the car can drive itself under limited geographic conditions and doesn’t need driver supervision. However, the technology that powers them is not ready for mass-market use outside of its test areas.
Waymo’s hardware is much more robust than Tesla’s. It uses several redundant sensor systems, including lidar, radar, and cameras, to create a real-time picture of where it’s operating. The company also maps areas ahead of time by having human drivers manually drive the vehicles through them. Meanwhile, Tesla vehicles rely exclusively on cameras and ultrasonic sensors.
“The more sensors you have, it adds to the complexity of the system, but it also makes it way safer,” Ramsey said.
Cameras aren’t as accurate at gauging distance as lidar or radar, andtheir ability to map an area can be impaired by everyday hazards like snow, dust, or darkness. However, cameras are a lot cheaper, and that matters when it comes to getting this technology into consumers’ hands.
You can purchase a souped-up Model 3 Tesla for around $75,000. However, experts don’t think Tesla vehicles could be fully autonomous with their current hardware, and will likely need to incorporate other technology like lidar to get there. We don’t know the exact price of Waymo vehicles — which are Chrysler Pacificas and Jaguar I-Paces outfitted with Waymo’s sensors and autonomous driver tech — but the company’s former CEO previously said it “cost no more than a moderately equipped Mercedes S-Class,” which has a price tag of about $180,000. Waymo says its costs have come down significantly with the latest generation.
But by selling its vehicles to the general public, Tesla is able to collect lots of real-world driving data that will be useful in helping solve autonomous driving challenges. Raj Rajkumar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and an autonomous vehicle pioneer, calls Tesla’s data collection an “incredible advantage” but warns that data is “part of the answer, but it’s not the entire answer.” Still, he thinks Waymo ought to collect more of it from regular drivers in regular conditions.
“We should be driving them whenever they can drive themselves and, when they do not, humans drive themselves,” Rajkumar said. “And for a time we collect experience. We understand what works, what does not work, and we refine.”
Tesla’s relatively wide reach also means rolling out a truly autonomous vehicle, when they eventually make one, will be a lot easier.
“Tesla’s strategy is interesting because, if it works, it could be a lot more scalable. They could launch a lot faster in other cities than their competitors could,” Tasha Keeney, an analyst at Ark Invest, which has a large stake in Tesla, said. Keeney said a faster rollout of autonomous vehicles will hasten a safer driving future, but it won’t be without cost.
“Are computers better than humans at driving? I think yes,” she said. “Will there be mistakes along the way? Yes.”
What’s next for autonomous vehicles?
Experts estimate that we could have level 3 or 4 cars for sale within the next 10 years. But in the meantime, it’s important not to overlook the benefits that the pursuit of autonomous cars has already wrought. Cars will soon be able to reliably take over in some instances, say, on the highway — where the lanes are clearly marked and the rules are pretty clear — but humans might take over on city streets.
Already a number of advanced driver assistance features are showing up on regular vehicles. Automatic emergency braking, technology that automatically slows or stops the car before it hits an object, has been shown to reduce injuries and fatalities and will be standard on most vehicles sold in the US next year. Consumers can expect more of these features to spill over from the quest for autonomous vehicles in the next few years.
“We should all stop thinking in terms of something magical will happen and all of a sudden cars will become self-driving,” Rajkumar said. Rather, the shift will happen feature by feature, after many tests and improvements. “That last change will be so incremental you won’t be able to realize it happened over the last five to 10 years.”
When cars do become fully autonomous, there are also benefits beyond safe driving. Keeney said autonomous technology would also greatly reduce the cost of travel because of cars’ increased utilization as taxis, without the expense of a driver. “It’ll give a lot of people access to very inexpensive point-to-point travel, which could totally change our lives and how we get around.”
In the meantime, perhaps the path forward for self-driving cars isn’t a binary choice at all. We’ll likely see a spectrum of improvements from many car companies as they incorporate more and more driver assistance features. And although in the near term the tech might not be the self-driving future we were promised, it will be better than nothing.
“We should not lose sight of the benefits the technology can bring,” Rajkumar said. “It takes time, but we’ll eventually get there.”

Bike share equity remains an uphill battle in impoverished neighborhoods and communities populated primarily by low-income residents and people of color. However, neither catering to affluent, white men nor community apathy and indifference are necessarily to blame. The reasons are complicated, but progress is happening, and more inroads are on the horizon.
Bike sharing is a communal transportation service in which bikes are made available for short-term use. Typically, the bikes are picked up at one location and returned to another. The average fee, according to ScienceDirect, can be about $4.29 for a two-hour trip, but fees vary depending on the operator, the amount of use time, and the city. A two-hour ride in Washington D.C., for example, may cost $10 or more, according to Moneycrashers.
A movement is born
The fluctuating costs, variables like late turn-in fees, and the tendency for bike share systems to be located in more affluent communities or near tourist attractions, has pegged these services as a recreational amenity for the privileged. There is now an intentional movement to diversify and reframe bike share programs as a public transit service for everyone.
“It is important to be able to access essential services — to travel to a grocery store, a COVID vaccination site, school, or work. If you don’t have transportation, if you don’t have access to a reliable bus system or a car because you cannot afford it, you’re limited in your work, school or life options,” says Kiran Herbert, local program writer and content manager for PeopleforBikes, and a founding partner of Better Bike Share Partnership (BBSP).
BBSP is a collaboration that funds bike-equity initiatives in low-income and BIPOC communities. Since 2015, BBSP has funded 76 grants, totaling over $1.5 million, according to Herbert.
“Bike shares allow for mobility and freedom to participate in our society, and live a life you choose,” she continued.
Herbert was referring to making bike share systems accessible in all neighborhoods, particularly those areas where bike-share options can enhance or fill in public transit gaps. However, bike share equity exceeds operators actively placing bike share systems in underserved neighborhoods; access also includes affordability
The Detroit Solution
In Detroit, the MoGo Bike Share System offers a discounted access pass for low-income riders. The access pass is an annual membership that allows riders year-long, daily bike usage. The cost for people who receive some type of childcare or public assistance is $5 for the entire year. The usual fee is $95.
“We really didn’t want the price for bike share to be a barrier for anyone who needed transportation or even just to run errands, especially in a city like Detroit where so many people don’t have access to cars or maybe cannot afford other forms of transportation,” said Adriel Thornton, MoGo’s executive director.
Other cities, like Chicago and Philadelphia, offer similarly discounted annual passes and cash payment options in addition to credit or debit cards.
To increase accessibility, MoGo at one time partnered with CVS, Family Dollar and 7-Eleven stores, where people who lacked credit or debit cards could pay cash to purchase annual memberships. When that option ended, MoGo began accepting cash for certain bike share services utilizing Cash App.
In 2018, MoGo collaborated with the Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT) to offer MoGo memberships to individuals who were already purchasing weekly, biweekly, or monthly bus passes. Ninety percent of people using the DDOTXMoGo pass were non-white and used the pass to get to and from work, and to connect to public transportation. Eighty-one percent had an income of less than $25,000 per year. MoGo hopes to expand upon this pilot by providing free transfers between bike share and transit, reducing the transportation costs for single trips.
Funding for equity
To cover the cost of equity programs, bike share operators are often helped by city and foundation funding from organizations like BBSP. Nathan McNeil, research associate at Portland State University’s Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning, wonders what will happen when those funds run out.
“A lot of the equity programs depend on small pots of money here and there. They are rarely built into the long-term funding streams of the system. Bike share isn’t like transit, in that we don’t tend to have large subsidies or taxes that go toward supporting it. That needs to change if bike share is going to become a substantial part of these communities and cities in general,” McNeil said.
While McNeil’s concern may be valid, Noa Banayan, director of federal affairs for PeopleForBikes, is optimistic. “Bike share and micro-mobility are new at a federal level. That’s allowed it some flexibility in terms of how funding moves to the states, cities and towns,” Banayan said. Greater flexibility increases the categories, such as carbon reduction, transit and equity, through which bike-share programs can qualify for funding.
“Congress is set to pass a five-year funding bill called Connecting America’s Active Transportation Act. In addition to prioritizing funding for marginalized communities, the bill — if passed — will increase support for networked bike lanes and supportive infrastructure,” Banayan continued.
Infrastructure improvements needed
While affordability has been one challenge for underserved communities, the physical condition of city infrastructure in disinvested neighborhoods is another. Streets and sidewalks may be in disrepair, bike lanes and signage may not be available, and some neighborhoods are often sandwiched between major roads and highways, which present challenges for residents who want to ride, but fear for their safety.
“There are things that have been unequitable about transportation that bleed into bike share,” says Hebert. “We build highways through a lot of these neighborhoods, which make it really hard to put in bike lanes and [make it] dangerous to bike at all. . . . We know that traffic violence is also higher in those neighborhoods, so all those factors have kind of made it so that bike shares are concentrated in areas with those who already have the most privilege,” Herbert said.
Yalinette Rivera works as a team leader for Chicago-based Northwest Side Housing Center (NWSHC), which services the middle-to-working class, predominantly Latino Belmont-Cragin neighborhood. She agrees traffic violence can dissuade people from biking.
“I actually got into an incident where I was riding between a moving car on one side, and a parked car on the other. When the driver unexpectedly merged where I was riding, I collided with the parked car. I’ll just be upfront, I haven’t had a good experience biking in the area since then,” Rivera said.
She says she  primarily takes buses now, but looks forward to the addition of bike lanes in her community sometime in July. “I see a lot of youth and elderly people using bikes as transportation. They need to be able to move around safely,” Rivera said.
According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), 843 bicyclists were killed in car crashes with motor vehicles in 2019. To prevent traffic violence or accidents, marginalized communities need bike-friendly and traffic-calming infrastructure, like updated signage, decreased speed limits, narrower car lanes, curb extensions, and networked bike lanes and circuits that connect riders to transit depots, schools, stores, and other routine destinations — sometimes without ever having to share the road with cars.
The City of Philadelphia currently has 200 miles of bike lanes and 360 miles of circuit trails for urban and suburban bike transit, and is developing a citywide network of bike-friendly streets as a part of a comprehensive, $3.7 million federally funded program. The linked lanes and circuits will also promote safer passages for bicyclists. One-third of the city’s bike share systems are in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, according to McNeil.
What the numbers tell us
In 2017, McNeil surveyed communities of color in Chicago’s Bronzeville and New York City’s Bed Stuy neighborhoods to gauge their interest in bike share programs. Bike shares had been negatively associated with neighborhood gentrification, inability to afford cars, and other inaccuracies. The survey showed 73 percent of the respondents were not concerned about those things at all and saw a need for bike share programs.
To combat misinformation, bike-share equity programs often utilize bike-share ambassadors — people who mirror their constituents — to make others aware of what bike shares are and how to use them. Working with bike-share operators, these programs often set up bike rides so first-time riders can experience the service firsthand, often free of charge.
As for Chicago’s Belmont-Cragin neighborhood, where over 27,000 young people under the age of 18 reside, they welcome bike-share programs.
“We have no El station in our community. The El doesn’t go west enough, so we are a 15-minute bus ride from the El to Belmont-Cragin. We’re left without transit options for our young folks. Biking and scooters have become the primary mode of transit,” says NWSHC executive director James Rudyk.
In 2018, the NWSHC surveyed area youth to identify issues affecting the neighborhood.
Lack of public transportation options and biking infrastructure were major concerns. The community currently has no bike-share systems, but as a result of a youth-led advocacy, they have worked with the Chicago Department of Transportation, Active Transportation Alliance (a nonprofit that advocates for bike safety), various city aldermen, Divvy Bike Share System, and BBSP to achieve some major transportation goals.
Equitable outcomes
By the end of July, the city plans to add five miles of bike lanes. Through BBSP’s Living Lab funding initiative, NWSHC will also purchase 100 Divvy for Everyone, $5-discounted annual membership passes, so residents will be able to afford to participate in the bike share when the bike stations are available.
NWSHC has also been pegged by Divvy to pilot a program that streamlines a stringent verification process from detailed paperwork and online submissions, to signing a waiver and purchasing the pass, according to Jose Cuebas, a NWSHC youth organizer.
Regarding local access to Chicago’s Divvy Bike Share System, Cuebas said,
“I don’t know why they didn’t put Divvys on the northwest side or the south side until last year. Maybe they don’t see the ridership among people [there], but that’s simply not true. We see people riding bikes every day. We see kids riding their bikes and others riding to work or riding to school, so we need options as well.”

The Re:Move electric cargo mover prototype in actionPolestarVIEW 4 IMAGES
Earlier this year, Volvo-owned Polestar signaled its intentions to move beyond electric cars and into other forms of clean transport, introducing an electric transporter concept for carrying goods around urban areas. The company has now turned up to IAA 2021 in Germany with a fully-functioning prototype, which carries with it a few new details around how a production version of the so-called urban “sled” will work.
The Re:Move electric cargo mover concept was first revealed back in March and featured a highly practical flatbed design just begging to be loaded up with boxes, bags or other cargo. While originally listed as 600 lb (275 kg), the payload capacity has now been pared back to 396 lb (180 kg), though the Re:Move maintains a slim profile designed to suit most bike lanes, measuring just 750 mm (30 in) across.
Made from recyclable aluminum, the Re:Move’s chassis is fitted with an electric tilting mechanism to lean into corners and allow for a tight turning circle of less than 7 m (23 ft). A damped rear swing arm should make the ride a little less jarring for the people and items onboard, and disc brakes also feature for greater stopping power.
A 2.2-kWh battery pack powers the whole operation, with the Re:Move limited to a maximum speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph) in line with the electric bicycle laws of many jurisdictions. Always-on front lighting, brake lights, a horn and optional indicators are also onboard for the purposes of safety.
The Re:Move is the result of a collaboration between Polestar, e-bike-maker Cake, aluminum manufacturer Hydro, Wallpaper magazine, and industrial designer Konstantin Grcic. There are no figures offered on range at this point, nor on price or availability, but the designers are positioning the Re:Move as a cleaner alternative to delivery vans in cities, or even as a cargo transportation solution in rural areas.
“The passion and expertise our partners have brought to this project shows the power of great design,” says Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar CEO. “Electrifying vehicles is the start point, not the end game. Our engineers have proven that this kind of open collaboration will accelerate innovation and the shift to truly sustainable mobility.”

There are many data sets available to fleet managers, so implementing some best practices will help you maximize the functionality of your telematics systems and engage in useful data management.
Telematics can provide incredible insights to fleet managers about the productivity and safety of their drivers and fleet.
Furthermore, telematics systems that incorporate machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) can even help fleet managers predict potential issues to make impactful business decisions.
There are many data sets available to fleet managers, so implementing some best practices will help you maximize the functionality of your telematics systems and engage in useful data management.
Here are some dos and don’ts of telematics to help fleet managers stay on the right track.
DO
Implement a driver coaching systemThe data gathered from telematics systems illustrates certain modifications that could improve driver behavior. Implementing these modifications will result in a reduction of losses and increased safety on the roads.
A driver coaching program is both a written and verbal safety policy that clearly states driver expectations and performance. Encourage consistent communication with employees and establish a system for employees to provide feedback, address concerns or get their questions answered in a swift and easy manner.
Master the system you’re usingThe best way to get the most out of your telematics system is to take the time to learn it.
You may uncover beneficial use-cases for your particular industry that you may not have without knowing the full capabilities. Lean on your telematics provider’s training resources.
They should have an extensive learning/help center and provide role-based training sessions and courses so that your drivers and admins only need to learn what matters to their day-to-day use of the platform.
These courses can be offered live online or recorded for on-demand use. Take the time to learn your telematics program and about the various metrics you can measure and leverage.
Clearly define and communicate the key metrics that you want to trackPay attention to details but avoid obsessing over each tiny data point.
Telematics can provide fleet managers with a great deal of data, so it’s imperative to have goals and an overall operational plan. This could include benchmarks in driver productivity and efficiency, safety, fleet maintenance and any other business-related goals.
By spotlighting data that makes sense for your relevant objectives, it will allow you to adjust and make decisions that move the needle in a meaningful way for your set criteria.
Further to this point, be intentional with your internal communication plan and be transparent in sharing with employees which key performance indicators will be measured when they are hired. Have managers and team leads set clear expectations upfront regarding productivity and safety.
Fleet managers can garner driver buy-in for safety coaching programs and performance feedback reviews by consistently communicating with employees and establishing an efficient and easy system for employees to provide feedback, address concerns and have questions answered.
Another communication approach would be to start small and only focus on the most impactful metrics at first. Initially tracking only important data points— such as idling rates, delivery times and basic driving behaviors — can prevent drivers from feeling overwhelmed and heavily monitored when adopting a new telematics system, and fleet managers can always expand upon the initial list of tracked metrics as time goes on.
DON’T
Rely on telematics as the only way to evaluate employees and identify bad driversYes, it is important to carefully analyze the collected data, but do not use this as thesole form of driver evaluation. This could lead to distrust between managers and employees.
There may have been extenuating circumstances, such as traffic delays or road accidents, that caused a reduction in driver efficiency, so make sure to review the entire situation before labeling someone as a bad driver.
As discussed in the “dos,” a holistic approach to employee evaluation is rooted in open communication. By having conversations with customers, coworkers and – most importantly – the driver in question, you will gain a more accurate representation of an employee’s performance.
Be hard on employees when adopting your telematics softwareIt is natural for employees to be resistant or feel overwhelmed when a company implements new technologies.
Do not expect employees to embrace the system immediately. Give them time to feel it out, which will in time improve their overall performance. You also do not want to hide any information from employees. Instead, implement a user-friendly system and capitalize on transparency with employees. Hiding important information or eluding arduous questions will not lead to desired driver results.

The American public transit system seems to be in shambles. Citizens have steadily abandoned public transport in favour of private vehicles. An ongoing debate about the state of public transport cites numerous factors, including lack of funds. However, it is not just the government that is to be blamed for the decline in the usage of public transport.
The State of the American Public Transit System
Several means of public transport exist in US cities like Washington DC, New York City, Boston, Seattle Chicago, and San Francisco. While cities like Houston has an excellent public transport system,  many places suffer from traffic congestion problems because there are no mass transit solutions.
Since 2012, public transport ridership has increased in New York but has declined in many other cities. The major reason is that mass transit systems are plagued with safety and operational problems. Passengers getting held up because of trains breaking down is no longer something out of the ordinary.  Moreover, places like the New York subway stations have noticed an increase in passenger violence and theft.
To understand the declining state of the American public transit system, one needs to look into how public transport systems were maintained by the government in the past.
At the turn of the 20th century, once private automobiles became popular, instead of improving services to stay competitive, the U.S transit agency downgraded service to cut costs.
This neglect drove away many riders, creating a notion that public transport is a welfare system for those who cannot afford to drive. This notion created a vicious cycle where only those who couldn’t afford private vehicles used public transport and the government offered minimal funds for maintenance.
The downside to viewing public transport as a welfare system is that it prevents the system from charging a fee high enough to provide efficient service. Moreover, American citizens prioritize trains and buses with higher reach over frequency. They want the American public transit system to cater to every block, instead of fewer trains which arrive frequently.
However, those who understand public transport agree that it is better to have fewer lines with frequent trains instead of many trains which leave once every few hours.
What Other Cities Got Right About Public Transit
Canada is geographically spread out just like the US but still manages to have a well-functioning public transport system in its major cities. This is because Canadian policymakers believe in having a transport system which focuses on frequency rather than reach and invest funds accordingly.
The fundamental difference between the transit in European and American cities is the infrastructure of the transport. Post the Second World War, automobiles became a symbol of reconstruction. Europe developed elaborate plans to diminish historic neighbourhoods to make way for wider roads and parking spaces.
The US did the same, but the difference was that European suburbs were designed in a way that made transit use viable whereas the early US suburbs like New York were built along highways and had an underdeveloped transit service.
The primary idea differentiating transit systems in the US from other countries in the developed world is the amount of importance and attention given to public transportation. If viewed as a welfare system, public transport will continue to be deprived of adequate funds for maintenance.
Public transport reduces carbon gas emissions and consumption of fuel, making it great for the environment. With a burgeoning population, public transport also tackles the problem of limited parking spaces.
Being the largest economy in the world, the US will have to invest in improving the public transport system for its citizens.

The continent of Europe has been making strides in harnessing smart technologies alongside implementing traffic regulations to improve urban mobility. A Sustainable Mobility Report published in March 2020 by the European Cyclists’ Federation (ECF) concluded that France has the most effective off-street parking regulations in all of Europe. The report titled ‘Making Buildings Fit for Sustainable Mobility’ came to this conclusion after investigating a total of 56 off-street parking regulations for both cars and bicycles across 31 European cities.
Sustainable Mobility Report
The report also stated that France is the only country in Europe to have implemented maximum car parking norms as opposed to minimum parking requirements. They achieved this by restricting the number of car parking slots that can be built per housing unit. The ECF found that a theory that has gained merit in academic research circles is, that minimum availability of car parking promotes vehicular ownership and its use. Households own and use more cars and evade public transport if there is ample access to off-street parking.
Minimum parking requirements (MPRs) lead to an over-supply of parking spaces that negatively impact living costs and construction costs. Minimum car parking impositions have turned out to be detrimental to sustainable mobility.
Other than France, the cities of Berlin in Germany and Tyrol in Austria were found to have the most effective and sustainable parking legislations regionally. Whereas, Hungary, Lithuania, Slovenia, and The Netherlands stood out for providing citizens with sustainable parking solutions and facilities on a national level.
Sustainable parking practices encourage more efficient use of parking space in areas where mobility is problematic. These practices also include technology-driven solutions like ride-hailing, ride-sharing, smart parking, etc. to reduce demand for parking.
Since after this report was published, the ECF has been insisting that all national and local authorities in Europe impose a similar maximum parking policy instead of minimum parking restrictions (MPRs) and the corresponding mobility management services.
ECF’s senior policy officer who is also the report’s lead author declared that there is a need to make buildings more sustainable in terms of mobility and energy-efficiency. Doing away with minimum car parking regulations and installing maximum car limits is critical for delivering on the aforementioned objectives.
In Conclusion 
It can be said without a shred of doubt that a lot can be learned by the examples in parking regulations set by France. Furthermore, The ECF report is a first of its kind attempt at rigorously collecting, contrasting and ranking parking norms across Europe. Findings from this report will feed into making our surroundings more sustainable.

The last mile’s always there, always a challenge, always urgent – and never more so than when eCommerce explodes.
The prime mover advantage, of course, goes to the “King Kong” of eCommerce, which would be Amazon. You’ve likely experienced the compressed delivery times Amazon has been able to offer – what used to be two days’ delivery is now one – and in some cases, you can get what you want in a matter of hours.
A slew of other companies, across a slew of other verticals, have been pushing through their own innovative last-mile efforts to satisfy customers’ expectations, honed by the “Amazon effect,” that they can get what we want, pretty much when they want.
Amazon, of course, has not in any way been resting on logistics laurels. The firm has been extending its fulfillment footprint by leaps and bounds. As detailed by CFO Brian Olsavsky on its earnings call, the firm has increased its capacity by 50 percent through Amazon Logistics.
Logistics, he said, has been “a large area of investment – not only fulfillment centers, but also two elements of transportation, what we call the middle mile, where we’re putting sort centers, Amazon Air, line haul, trailers … think of all the intermediate movements between our warehouses and our final delivery stations.” The last mile includes the delivery service network, where “we see … the ability to control the whole flow of products from the warehouse to the end customer.” A majority of units, the company has said, are flowing through Amazon Logistics.
Groceries And Retail, By Air  
In the bid to modernize, streamline and speed delivery, we’re seeing efforts by other large, mainstream retailers to use high tech to gain an edge in reaching the customer at the doorstep across novel means.
As has been announced this month, Kroger and Drone Express have entered a pilot program to offer grocery delivery by drone in the Midwestern U.S. In terms of mechanics, package delivery is made to the location of a customer’s smartphone, not simply a street address, in some cases within a quarter of an hour. The company is providing bundled offerings such as baby care, or a “s’mores” bundle (with the ingredients for that particular snack). Walmart has had its own drone program in place, as reported in this space earlier in the year.
None of this is to say that more traditional players have been sitting still. FedEx late last year bought ShopRunner, an eCommerce platform, to shore up its eCommerce presence. That platform, the firms said upon news of the deal, connects millions of consumers to more than 100 brands with free two-day shipping and free returns.
(And, of course, delivery aggregators are still cementing their own presence with restaurants and other merchants.)
It would make sense that smaller enterprises would want to gain the scale and efficiencies that their larger brethren enjoy. And in another example, Shopify’s management said on the conference call with analysts that demand for its own fulfillment efforts has been strong. Shopify Shipping, according to management, said that its volume in the first quarter was roughly the same as the fourth quarter. The fulfillment network, the company has said, is geared toward firms that sell in the U.S. and have fewer than 200 SKUs. Those fulfillment centers pick, pack and ship products on behalf of the smaller merchants.
As the digital shift continues, it seems, there are many paths toward transforming the last mile.

 With public and private partners, Pittsburgh’s city government is the first in the country to launch a digital system coordinating local transit options. It represents the local entrance to an international sustainability-minded movement. 
 By Sophie Burkholder / STAFF 
Pittsburgh will soon be a national leader in mobility tech.
Earlier this month, the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure launched a two-year initiative called Move PGH, a comprehensive program convening private and public transportation options both physical and online to help Pittsburghers get where they need to go. Partners of the program include electric scooter rental company Spin, moped rental company Scoobi, local bike share system Healthy Ride, Waze Carpool and Transit, among others.
Move PGH centers around a robust app, powered by Transit, and 50 new physical mobility hubs across the city. While Transit has operated its services in Pittsburgh since 2013 and currently has over 40,000 users in the area, this new and improved digital hub will add even more transportation options to its current offerings.
Citing the recent growth of car ridesharing as well as shared bike and scooter systems, Move PGH underscores the need for a central place to find availability and pricing across all transportation options. Though Pittsburgh has been ranked as having the 15th best public transit system in the country and currently has 134,717 workers living within a half mile of transit, Port Authority has actually cut several services and routes over the last decade and saw sharp revenue drops during the pandemic.
Those cuts, paired with Pittsburgh’s hilly topography that can make walking or biking more difficult, mean that the 20% of residents without a car still struggle to get to work, the grocery store or other essential destinations. Transportation problems are inherently equity ones too, as over 65% of Pittsburgh’s low-income households don’t have access to a private car according to Move PGH.
One solution that’s gained popularity in recent years is what’s called Mobility as a Service, aka MaaS, which is the use of a digital platform to allows passengers to plan and pay for transportation across a wide range of public and private options. Such services could eventually make individual vehicle ownership obsolete.
“Mobility as a Service, ultimately, is about making sure people have access to the transportation services that can help them get around, easily, affordably, sustainably, when they need them,” said Transit Communications Lead Stephen Miller. “And so the City of Pittsburgh’s approach here was to really look at Mobility as a Service as a way to get these private companies and the public services that are available to really connect together and make sure that people in Pittsburgh have a way to access all of these together, rather than everybody kind of doing their own thing.”
While already a popular approach in Europe — with Helsinki planning to eliminate the need for personal cars by 2025 — Pittsburgh is the first city to adopt this approach in the United States. But Miller wasn’t surprised to see the local community pioneer this program. Unlike larger cities that often have a variety of extensive public transportation options, midsize cities like Pittsburgh have become more dominated by cars, giving local governments more urgency in connecting residents to alternative choices.
“It’s really forced a lot of cities and transit agencies in these types of midsize cities to think really creatively about how they can improve their services, and how they can be really thoughtful and creative about shifting trips to more sustainable options,” Miller said.
There are unique technical considerations as Mobility as a Service becomes widespread. A growing standard used in the field is the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), which several public transportation options, including Port Authority, have adopted as a way to share information with navigation apps like Transit or Google Maps. Meanwhile, many bikeshare companies use General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) while ride-hailing and taxi companies use General On-Demand Feed Specification (GOFS).
These differences aren’t a problem, Miller said: “Because each mode of transportation has different needs, it makes total sense that there would be different data standards for transit, scooters/bikeshare, and on-demand services.”
“Ultimately, all of these mobility pieces should be able to speak the same language and connect together so people can easily make these trips.”STEPHEN MILLER, TRANSIT
But there’s a challenge in making sure these standards are adopted broadly within the transportation field.
“Ultimately, all of these mobility pieces should be able to speak the same language and connect together so people can easily make these trips,” he said.
Beyond making transportation more accessible to residents, Mobility as a Service has the potential to significantly reduce emissions — a critical and persistent issue for Pittsburgh, which the American Lung Association recently ranked as the ninth worst city in the country for air quality.
Part of those pollution issues are undoubtedly associated with the heavy use of cars here. A September 2019 report from mobility analytics company INRIX showed that 23% of car trips in Pittsburgh were less than one mile, while 50% were less than three miles.
Miller sees Move PGH and future work in Mobility as a Service as a way of resolving that classic last-mile problem in transportation.
“Those are distances that are easily covered by either walking or biking or electric scooters or public transit,” he said. “And so making sure that we build up these options and make them easy enough to access for people so they’re not just grabbing the car keys to go a mile down the road is really important to shifting those trips to more sustainable modes.”

With a near monopoly on delivery, Amazon is understandably keen to make the job easier. The latest idea that may or may not eventually see the light of day is a new patent for a system where delivery vans would carry items almost to their destination, then send out and direct ground drones to do the final drop-off.
Amazon and other companies like UPS are already experimenting with drones that fly or drive to deliver everything from packages to pizza to medicine. But the humble delivery van doesn’t need to worry about being rendered redundant just yet – it turns out that drones are terribly inefficient on their own.
So in the new patent, Amazon describes how it would pair them with delivery vans to make both more efficient. First, a “primary vehicle” (read a van, truck, car etc) would be loaded up with items to be delivered, as well as secondary vehicles – either flying drones, small ground vehicles, or both. The idea is that the van would drive to the destination, park in the street, then send the smaller vehicle to drop the parcel at the doorstep or wherever it needs to go.
But here’s the clever bit – rather than load out each drone with its own sensors and pathfinding hardware, that can be outsourced to equipment back in the van. Cameras, radar, sonar, LiDAR, or other location sensors can analyze the best path for the drone to take, then beam the instructions to it wirelessly over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or the like.
The secondary vehicle could be equipped with some kind of marking, like a QR code or a logo, that the van’s camera can track as the drone moves around. If need be, it can then recalculate new paths or speeds to help the drone get around obstacles. After the drop-off has been made, the van can then instruct the drone on how to get back.
As with most patents, there are plenty of variations on this general scenario – the primary vehicle could be a van, truck, car, etc, and either autonomous or driven by humans. The secondary drone could crawl along on wheels or have legs like a Boston Dynamics robot, and may or may not have its own sensors. Entire fleets of these robots could service a neighborhood under the watchful eye of a single van.
Also like most patents, there’s no guarantee this system will ever actually get off the ground. But Amazon and other companies always want to be patenting new innovations, no matter how pie-in-the-sky, if just to keep the competition from stealing the best ideas. If everything in Amazon’s imagined patented future were to come to pass, we might have drones launching from airships, trains and huge hives, recharging at lamp posts, and dropping parcels with parachutes.

 Integrating on-demand microtransit options into existing services allows agencies to better serve communities with affordable, convenient public transit, promoting economic mobility. 
By Kellie Meilleur
Nearly 70 percent of all Americans who depend on the bus for their transportation needs make less than $50,000 per year. This, according to a report by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), validates that lower-income individuals rely more heavily on public transportation than those who are earn higher incomes. 
Across the nation, more and more transit agencies and cities are turning to on-demand microtransit service to expand and improve public transportation options for low-income residents. 
What exactly is microtransit? Simply, microtransit is dynamic routing. It takes mobile smartphone apps and puts them to use to create an efficient mode of transport that adapts with each passenger’s trip needs. At the click of a button, passengers can book a trip that will take them on the quickest route to their desired destination.  
A distinctive aspect of microtransit, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, is that it is “a privately owned and operated shared transportation system that can offer fixed routes and schedules, as well as flexible routes and on-demand scheduling. The vehicles generally include vans and buses.” 
Microtransit can be easily accessible and highly efficient anda ‘no-brainer’ for many lower income individuals who can’t afford to own a car and have therefore been greatly underserved by traditional transit networks.
When COVID-19 first hit, a majority of higher income earners began working from home and using their personal vehicles for necessary travel. On the far end of the spectrum, millions of lower-income Americans didn’t have the same luxury or opportunity. They needed to get to and from their jobs and other destinations, despite sweeping changes in how transportation options had changed and disadvantaged many since the pandemic.  
That’s where microtransit in its many forms came into play, and in a big way. 
Many transit agencies, anxious to serve their most underserved customers and plug the gap between traditional fixed-route transportation and more individual transportation options, are offering riders fast and convenient ways to book their trips.  
Microtransit has proven to be a mobility lifeline. Amid the many shutdowns we have all experienced, on-demand transit has pivoted to serve specific community needs, such as food delivery to our most vulnerable community members and transporting hospital and other frontline workers to their jobs, even in the overnight hours. In fact, APTA’s data shows that dynamic, on-demand public transit has proven to be a mobility lifeline for those in low-income areas during this crisis.
Transit industry expert, thought leader and influencer Paul Comfort recently hosted a podcast segment on his show, Comfort’s Corner, about the role of microtransit for equity and inclusion. As a thought leader in the public transportation space, Comfort sees public transportation’s role as one to improve equity and inclusion for those who need it most.First, it was for the elderly and those with mobility challenges, and now, it’s for those who are underserved.
Comfort believes that microtransit is the hottest trend to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. When the pandemic hit, transportation providers made major changes to their service based on changing ridership demand and to adhere to health and safety requirements. This included altering transit routes and changing the frequency of trips. These changes immediately impacted those who had no other means of getting from point A to point B. The silver lining is that microtransit has been the solution to the transit shortage problem. Comfort explains that “microtransit fills the transit gaps, and it ensures that no one gets left behind.”  
The great news is that the stop-gap solution that microtransit provides is here to stay. Significant data across several U.S. cities has recently been gathered suggesting that microtransit has been a vital public resource for lower-income individuals since the start of the pandemic. This information, along with insights shared by transit thought leaders like Comfort, help the transportation industry to look ahead to the long-term need for microtransit as part of the equity and inclusion solution. 
By joining the microtransit movement and integrating on-demand options into existing public transit infrastructure, transit providers across the country can better serve their communities with affordable, convenient public transportation and promote economic mobility for all.

The Ioniq 5 robotaxi is expected to start ride-hailing duty in 2023HyundaiVIEW 6 IMAGES
Hyundai launched the first vehicle in its new all-electric Ioniq brand back in February, the almost-true-to-concept Ioniq 5 hatchback. And now the company has partnered with autonomous vehicle company Motional to put the shapely EV to work as a robotaxi.
The Ioniq 5 is based on Hyundai’s Electric-Global Modular Platform, with its 118-in (3,000-mm) wheelbase making for a relatively large cabin so that occupants can stretch out and enjoy the journey. The vehicle comes in several battery and motor configurations, and it’s not clear which setup will be used for the robotaxi variant at this stage.
But, by way of an example, the vehicle could run on a 72.6-kWh long-range battery pack for a per-charge WLTP range of up to 298-miles (480-km), and roll with a single-motor RWD option that puts out 258 lb-ft (350 Nm) of torque and zips from standstill to 62 mph (100 km/h) in 7.4 seconds.
Not that such things will be important to ride-hailing passengers, who are promised “a spacious, comfortable place to work, relax, or socialize during their driverless ride.” And should customers wish to amend the route along the way, or make additional stops, the vehicle will be equipped with rider-focused interfaces to allow for communication with onboard navigation systems.
The partnership is looking to make the Ioniq 5 robotaxi a Level 4 autonomous vehicle, which will use its suite of more than 30 sensors mounted around the vehicle to navigate without the need for a safety driver behind the steering wheel. This sensor suite of cameras, radars and LiDAR will monitor the world around the vehicle at up to 300 m (984 ft) away, and feed data into Motional’s driverless technology suite.
Numerous redundancies are being built into the setup to ensure smooth operation and passenger safety during autonomous driving, though Motional technicians will be able to remotely take control should the vehicle get into trouble.
The robotaxi is expected to undergo many months of rigorous testing in simulated environments, on closed courses, and on public roads, before accepting it’s first passenger, with Motional saying that the “testing is only completed once we’re confident our robotaxis are safer than a human driver.”
Motional has teamed up with ride-hailing service Lyft, and will begin ferrying passengers in Ioniq 5 robotaxis from 2023 across major US cities. But before then, the vehicle will make its public debut at the IAA Mobility in Munich expo, which runs from September 7-12.

Dominos, FedEx, Kroger, Walmart, Alibaba, JD.com, and Meituan all use rolling robots today.[1] Previously, ARK estimated that a sidewalk robots could deliver food orders for as little as 6 cents per mile, 20 times less than the cost of human delivery. Although local regulations may slow down the rollout of sidewalk robot systems, slightly larger robots that can integrate with traffic could pick up the slack. According to ARK’s latest research, integrated traffic robots similar to those from Nuro could deliver food for less than 40 cents per trip, six times less than the cost of a personal trip to the grocery store, as shown below.

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon.
Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, based on data sourced from Internal Revenue Service
If every household in the US were to use robot delivery for groceries, today’s average of 1.6 trips per week per household would translate into a $4 billion market opportunity.[2] Moreover, the cost and convenience could encourage customers to order groceries in smaller batches at higher frequency. If customers were to order fresh groceries five times a week, for example, ARK estimates the robot grocery delivery market could expand to $12 billion a year, paling in comparison to the roughly $70 billion cost of all household grocery deliveries in the US, accounting for personal car transportation costs and the “unpaid labor” associated with such trips, as shown below.

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon.
Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, based on data sourced from Internal Revenue Service, Nuro, The Food Industry Association, AAA, Bureau of Labor Statistics
ARK estimates that robot delivery of groceries would commercialize roughly $40 billion in unpaid wages, converting previously unmeasured economic activity into paid services. In addition, roughly $6 billion in gasoline demand would disappear as electric robots increasingly replace gas powered cars, eliminating roughly 18 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, the equivalent of that associated with 4 million cars on the road.[3]
ARK believes that the use cases for robot delivery will extend past groceries. Dominos would create a $500 million opportunity, for example, if robots were deliver its pizzas.[4] Ground robot delivery networks also could work alongside delivery drones, reshaping consumer behavior by providing inexpensive and convenient ways to receive groceries, take-out food, and other household essentials. Home designs probably would change as well. If customers were to order fresh groceries more often, refrigerators probably would shrink in size and pantry closets would be repurposed. While these changes probably will take time to penetrate households, ARK estimates that the total available market (TAM) associated with collapsing the costs of last mile delivery and transforming how consumers buy, store, and consume food will be roughly $30 billion in the US alone.[5]

In urban areas, both big and small, parking systems are a headache for both commuters and city governments. Most resident parking, pay, and display systems are either overcrowded or not adequately located. One of the best ways to tackle both these issues is by using park and ride systems in urban areas.
What Are “Park and Ride” systems?
Thousands of residents use private transport to travel to work, make grocery runs, or catch up with friends. All these activities are necessary but end up crowding the roads, mainly if everyone uses a separate car. While carpooling is a viable solution, it won’t work entirely if different people have the same route but various destinations in mind.
That is where a system like Park and Ride systems can reduce the number of vehicles on the road. Under Park and Ride systems, commuters park their private cars in designated parking spots, which are well connected with public transport hubs. They then use public transportation to cover the remaining distance to their destination.
This intermodal parking and transport system is already being practiced in thousands of cities in various countries. In places where “Park and Ride” has been systematically implemented, it has helped reduce traffic congestions, thus improving public transport usage and better organizing parking systems.
Advantages of Park and Ride systems
Some salient features of every park and ride system are as follows.
Park and ride systems improve urban mobility to a large extent. As several private vehicles are not used simultaneously, traffic congestion reduces, which in turn, reduces commute time. The system also encourages public transport usage and generates more revenue for city governments.Carpooling, an effective way to reduce both pollution and traffic congestion in urban areas, becomes the most popular when well-planned park and ride locations are introduced throughout a city. As people do not have to struggle with finding a fellow rider the whole way to a destination, they also embrace traveling with a friend or a family member more readily.Even people from suburban areas benefit from a park and ride system as residents traveling to the city center need not waste fuel commuting hundreds of miles each day. They can instead drive to a park and ride lot and use public transit from there to enter the city. This advantage, however, is apparent only when the park and ride lots are also situated on the outskirts of a town.
Any park and ride location is best when located away from sites of heavy congestion. While easily accessible, these areas should not be located very close to places that remain heavily crowded, especially during peak hours. These locations should also be well connected with public transport networks so that they are incentivizing enough for all commuters. Once a municipality decides to construct a park and ride lot, steps must be taken for proper implementation and maintenance. It must be kept clean and should not be overly expensive.
Considering the host of advantages this system offers and the relatively small investment, it demands, park and ride lots are a future-proof way of reducing traffic congestion in urban areas. They also make cities more pleasant for both commuters and tourists, and when planned carefully, they have very few downsides. For cities looking to turn smart, park and ride is a must-adopt system.

Imagine a robot riding the elevator up your tower block, knocking on your door, and delivering the package you ordered an hour earlier: That’s the future of e-commerce in China. 
Tech giant Alibaba Group sees a fleet of robots as a fast, reliable and relatively cheap way to fulfill the burgeoning demand for online shopping across China, the world’s largest consumption market. 
In a big step towards hitting this goal, Alibaba is deploying 1,000 delivery bots across Chinese university campuses and urban communities this year. The bots, called Xiaomanlv or “small donkey” in Mandarin, can deliver about 50 packages at a time and as many as 500 boxes in one day, covering 100 kilometers on a single charge.
The bots pick up parcels at a local courier drop-off point and make their way to your building, trundling along sidewalks and in bicycle lanes. To be sure, they can’t navigate a flight of stairs yet, but the technology is steadily improving. 
In the future, the bots could gradually replace forklifts in factories, dispose of medical waste in hospitals and even move luggage around airports.
The idea is that these bots will “learn” how to navigate obstacles safely in low-speed minor roads and cul-de-sacs, such as serving a college campus or within a housing estate. Damo Academy will analyze insights gathered from these early models and then upgrade the bots to be safe to maneuver even on public roads.  
“In three to five years, we hope to make progress in autonomous driving in faster speed scenarios and make deliveries over longer distances,” said Wang Gang, head of Damo Autonomous Driving Lab in Hangzhou, in an interview with Alizila.Play VideoDelivery bots fan out on a university campus to deliver parcels
Last-mile delivery has always been the knotty problem of e-commerce. It’s costly, time-consuming and largely unmapped. This final leg in a journey that stretches from the manufacturer to the buyer can flummox human couriers. Delivery people can get lost trying to find a flat in a tower block or navigate a large housing estate. 
Alibaba’s robots will be able to make the trip without deviations or smoke breaks. Alibaba’s algorithm plots the fastest route for the robot to your door. 
The robot can predict the intended movement of passengers and vehicles up to 5 to 10 seconds in the future and safely avoid collisions. In test runs, 99.9999% of the time, the Xiaomanlv’s auto-driving algorithm manages without human intervention. For industry experts, this is known on a scale of Levels 0 to 5, as Level 4 meaning a high degree of automation.
The very top of the automation spectrum, Level 5, seems like a distant nirvana for autonomous-driving experts, given the reams of traffic data needed to make the robots and self-driving cars safe to travel on busy public roads. 
Level 4 is sufficient to solve the last-mile conundrum of e-commerce. More importantly, the robot’s positioning technology allows it to operate even where there’s weak or no GPS signal, making it a reliable deliveryman even outside China’s supercities.
China’s e-commerce market is the largest in the world and its growth has stimulated the swift development of logistics to fulfill customers’ orders. The coronavirus pandemic has also accelerated the shift in consumption from offline to online and heightened customers’ demand for contactless delivery of packages.  
Package deliveries topped 830 billion in mainland China last year, nine times the volume of 2013, according to China’s Post Office.
At the same time, there are fewer able-bodied couriers in China, one of the fastest aging populations globally. The World Health Organization expects the percentage of people over 60 years old in China to hit 28% by 2040.“We do not have enough labor to deliver so many packages to consumers … it’s impossible without automated technologies. So, this is why Xiaomanlv is very important,” said Damo Academy’s Wang, who is a key man in Alibaba’s drive to develop the bots. He spent over a decade researching artificial intelligence as an academic and now wants to put theory into practice. 
“I hope to build AI products that can have practical application and a big social impact, rather than academic impact,” said Wang. “Alibaba’s Damo Academy’s objective is to develop products that can be used – so this aligns well with my motivation.”
As consumers demand faster and more flexible delivery schedules, e-commerce companies are racing to rewire their logistics networks. The Hangzhou-headquartered group offers customers in China one-hour delivery, half-day delivery and next-day delivery. 
“Nowadays, consumers have higher expectations such as delivery to their building so that they do not have to walk for miles to get their package,” said Wang.  
Damo Academy is working closely with Alibaba’s logistics arm Cainiao to deploy the bots, known in the industry as autonomous mobile robots. 
Delivery companies such as FedEx and UPS still handle most packages globally. However, a few retailers are exploring more cutting-edge solutions such as drone deliveries. That said, there are relatively few drones in circulation, given the high level of regulatory clearance needed. Delivery robots, or bots, on the other hand hold more promise in terms of mass deployment. 
Big breakthroughs in the field of autonomous driving have largely depended on that lightning bulb moment when one or two engineers find inspiration from years of research. Many companies are still developing prototypes when it comes to autonomous driving, particularly when it comes to carrying passengers.  
Alibaba’s approach is to build steadily on the insights gleaned from the bots already in action, increasing the likelihood of developing a more mature and useful algorithm rather than relying on engineers in the lab.  
Wang believes that Alibaba’s algorithm is strong enough not to need expensive, high-definition sensors that some companies’ prototypes need to navigate.
“So, we can lean more on our algorithm to achieve a low-cost, mass deployment of the robots,” said Wang.

Artificial Intelligence. Machine Vision. Big Data. There’s a lot of buzz around advanced technology being applied in nearly every sector from construction and field services, to trucking and logistics. Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai recently said the development of AI was more profound for humans than fire and electricity. 
But let’s talk about the bottom line: how can these technologies, when used together, create opportunities to most effectively drive down costs and generate revenue?
Going beyond video
The most advanced machine vision algorithms can be trained to detect just about anything the human eye can see. Fleets have used this capability to optimize safety training and driver retention, and also collect evidence that can help lower liability costs in traffic incidents and reduce insurance premiums.
But this technology excels when data, machine vision (MV), and artificial intelligence (AI) are used in concert (MV+AI) to provide a more holistic context to events. As an example, a collision happened when a fleet vehicle collided with a car while both vehicles were merging onto the freeway, making it difficult to establish the sequence of events just based on video.
When combining the metadata from the video feed with the ECM data from the vehicle, and predictive data from a MV stream, the usage of turn signals and acceleration/deceleration by the driver were related to the event.
This data, combined with the video, helped establish that the carrier’s driver did not cause of the collision. When we solve patterns like this, we are able to further use machine learning and artificial intelligence to extend this sort of pattern analysis to other similar, unrelated events at large scale to automatically establish their contexts.
Identifying customer needs
MV+AI can also detect otherwise innocuous elements in an environment that, when combined with customer data, reveal opportunities for fleets to expand services to existing clients or even generate new customer leads.
These can arise not only during a driver’s route but at the point of dispatch or delivery. A waste disposal company that uses MV+AI could detect when a customer’s bins are overflowing and automatically suggest additional collection service that the disposal company can provide within the customer’s budget.
The company could also detect overflowing bins at locations along its regular routes and, combined with mapping data, reveal potential new customer leads or upsell opportunities. As an example, intelligent video can help identify specific areas where overgrown trees need to be trimmed away from power lines. Another example, related to municipal services and safety, is detecting broken traffic lights, faded lane markings, or missing traffic signs.
Predicting events
Ever since the invention of the fuel gauge, monitoring the mechanics of vehicles has been a key part of optimizing vehicle management and reducing costs.
But now we can go a step further. Pairing data from vehicle monitoring systems connected to the engine control module with a predictive AI means fleets can anticipate and prepare for maintenance. Optimizing maintenance operations also helps to prevent risks such as an engine failing while operating at 60 mph on a freeway, which can create a dangerous situation for all drivers on the road.
The further ahead fleets can plan repairs, the better position they are in to minimize the costs and disruption to operations. And the less time a service vehicle is in the shop, the more time it can spend in the field serving clients and generating revenue.
Reducing internal silos
Using all three – MV, AI, and data – together and concurrently across a fleet unlocks the true value of these technologies.
Having a single pane of control across company departments allows for the reduction in internal silos and reduces the risk that one priority for the company is optimized at the expense of others. In fact, using data in isolation can become detrimental.
An example that comes up time and again is the importance of compliance and safety departments using the same technology and data to make decisions in real-time. Drivers, for example, are limited in the number of consecutive hours they spend behind the wheel for compliance reasons. If fleets only optimized for compliance, a siloed system would just select the next available driver, rather than the next available driver with an appropriate safety rating.
Neglecting to look at complete data can be a major pitfall for companies and can result in leaving money on the table or increasing rather than reducing operational risks.
The future of data
Data is often the biggest asset a company has, and we anticipate that in the future more companies will use it as a source of revenue itself.
All operational companies, whether freight or otherwise, have something in their data that would be useful to other segments in their industry.  The data on the maintenance costs of a 5,000-vehicle fleet could, for example, provide valuable lead generation insights to a maintenance company. The safety data of drivers in different geographic areas would allow insurance companies to more accurately assess the risk scores of potential clients in the region.
In the future, smart cities will include this type of data, too. A fleet’s route data on hazards or traffic would be crucial for local governments when it comes to city planning or providing services such as waste or tree removal. Fleets might eventually be buying anonymized data from other fleets as a way to share intelligence on equipment that both use and uncover patterns that help optimize their use and lifespan.
Provided that the proper steps are taken to de-identify data, the future points to more robust data marketplaces where companies and even fleets turn their data into a valuable revenue generator.
As MV+AI and data capabilities become more commonplace and widespread, the fleets that can use it most efficiently to capture revenue and break down silos will have the edge.

 Pittsburgh is a hub for AV development, and local companies are keeping sustainability in mind. But researchers and city officials still have concerns about the disruptive technology’s unknowns. 
By Sophie Burkholder
Though political fights and Tesla have pushed electric vehicles to the forefront of automobile industry news this year, one of Pittsburgh’s leading tech sectors could also be a key player in making transportation more sustainable than ever before.
Autonomous vehicles have a long history in Pittsburgh, starting with Carnegie Mellon University’s winning team in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. Since then, several companies in the sector have built their headquarters here, continually bringing jobs, wealth and engineering prowess to the area. Pittsburgh, for its part, has welcomed the new technology, starting with Mayor Bill Peduto’s early work in allowing Uber to test its initial fleet of autonomous cars.
While a full commercial launch of the technology is still yet to come, recent announcements from two area companies indicate that momentum is building. But for all of the new convenience and efficiency these cars might offer, their environmental advantages are somewhat more nuanced than those of electric vehicles, leaving some to wonder how they will operate in a world that is de-emphasizing the trend of automobile transportation in the name of climate change.
Pittsburgh pollution
The main environmental benefit that autonomous vehicles offer is their efficiency: “Autonomous vehicles, in general, operate more optimally,” Neil Donahue, the director of CMU’s Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education and Research told Technical.ly. “They’re less lead-footy.”
More efficient driving means more efficient fuel usage, which should reduce vehicle emissions. That should mean cars will have less wear and tear over time and last longer, reducing both physical and energy waste that can come from automobile manufacturing. While Donahue acknowledged that the reductions would be less immediate than those seen with a switch to electric cars, he noted that even a small change can make a major difference to the region’s air quality.
“Autonomous vehicles, in general, operate more optimally. They’re less lead-footy.”NEIL DONAHUE, STEINBRENNER INSTITUTE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
A research publication from June of last year led by CMU Associate Research Professor in Mechanical Engineering Albert Presto showed just how much local traffic emissions contribute to air pollution in Pittsburgh. He and his coauthors found that during the morning rush hour period after stay-at-home orders were put in place last spring, carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide levels decreased by about 50% — which was also the approximate percent decrease in traffic levels during that time. Notably, other major polluters in the area like the U.S. Steel-owned Mon Valley Works steel mills operated at the same production levels throughout this time period, as they were deemed an essential service.
Such a dramatic decrease in toxic emissions is uniquely significant to Pittsburgh, Donahue said. The region’s long recovery from the pollution of its industrial past paired with a topography defined by hills and valleys means that harmful particulates tend to linger and concentrate more here, and this study shows that vehicle emissions are responsible for a worrying amount of that.
Donahue sees all of this as a compelling reason to ensure all autonomous vehicles are electric, particularly as traditional car companies have started shifting to that technology.
“It matters where the electricity comes from,” he said, noting that many power plants still rely on fossil fuels. “But they are real wins in terms of the local air pollution.”
But ensuring that electric future happens isn’t always as simple as strapping autonomous technology onto an existing electric vehicle. The weight and energy requirements of the sensors and monitors needed already limit the range of traditional fuel-powered cars, and would likely require more frequent battery charging in electric models. Still, recent research from CMU has shown that the increased efficiency of the technology and certain design choices to reduce drag can make any difference in the driving range for electric autonomous vehicles negligible.
Pittsburgh plans
Local companies are keeping that in mind. Argo AI, which recently announced a new partnership to launch its first product with Ford and Lyft at the end of this year, has plans to develop an autonomous version of the electric microbus Volkswagen ID.Buzz for launch by 2025.
“Looking further out, we would expect all of our vehicles that we’d work with to be electric going forward,” Argo AI Director of Communications Alan Hall said. For now, tests of the company’s autonomous technology are done on older 2016 or 2017 hybrid car models.
Aurora, another local autonomous vehicle company that just shared plans to go public through a SPAC, also sees electrification as a goal for its technology.
“The Aurora Driver is designed to work across all vehicle platforms, including EVs, and we’re working with a range of vehicles readily available from our partners,” a spokesperson for the company said via email.
Even larger vehicle-focused companies like autonomous trucking firm Locomation, which has offices in the Strip District’s Robotics Row, want to see an electrified future for its technology, though the challenge there is much greater in terms of distance traveled and vehicle weight. Pointing to recent reports on the increasing availability of electric passenger cars, Locomation VP of Policy and Strategy Finch Fulton said “you’re seeing a lot of improvements on charging speed, charging capacity, and the range of vehicles.”
While that shows promise for smaller autonomous vehicles, Fulton — who formerly worked for the Department of Transportation — added that “the Department of Energy estimates that for Class 8 multi-motor vehicles, those will not be technically and economically feasible until 2030 or 2032.” But when that technology becomes available, it will undoubtedly address concerns around vehicles that still use diesel, which is known to produce higher levels of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides than gasoline-powered vehicles.
Locomation is also looking for ways to reduce the kinds of emissions that are unique to long-distance trucking, Fulton said. When human truck drivers need to take a break for sleep, they often do so in small cabins within the trucks, which typically need to use energy to be heated or cooled depending on the weather. But autonomous trucks wouldn’t have that problem — no one in the cabin to keep comfortable — and removing or reducing idling from even one truck could save up to 1,200 gallons of diesel and 24,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emitted per year, according to a report from the North American Council for Freight Efficiency.
Automated trucks would also benefit from speed control and smooth driving efficiency that smaller autonomous vehicles have. The negative impact on the environment would likely be less if trucks were programmed to go at a slower, more efficient and steady speed. Trucks traveling at a speed of 75 miles per hour, for instance, will burn 27% more fuel than ones traveling at 65 miles per hour, Finch noted.
Pittsburgh policy
Though local analysts, policymakers and researchers alike look forward to the myriad environmental gains of autonomous vehicle technology, many also remain wary about the rollout of this disruptive technology. Eric Beckman, the faculty co-director of the University of Pittsburgh’s Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation is particularly worried about what conservation and energy economists call the rebound effect.
“I think most people who look at autonomous vehicles, and are also interested in sustainability, worry about this kind of rebound impact where actually you can get more miles driven when it’s autonomous, because it’s so easy,” he said.
“I think most people who look at autonomous vehicles, and are also interested in sustainability, worry about this kind of rebound impact where actually you can get more miles driven when it’s autonomous.”ERIC BECKMAN, MASCARO CENTER FOR SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION
People who might have walked or biked somewhere before might more frequently turn to an autonomous vehicle in the future simply because the option might be more accessible to them. If that happens, Beckman sees the possibility of a scenario where autonomous vehicles are actually worse for the environment, since people would start using them more often than they used traditional cars. But he also thinks that fate is avoidable, so long as local officials and companies alike remain mindful of it as the technology becomes more present here.
“It’s kind of an unknown right now,” he said. “And until these things become more ubiquitous on the roads, I don’t know how we’re going to guess” what the outcome will be.
That one of many potential concerns Erin Clark, a policy analyst in the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure, hopes to help resolve as autonomous vehicles become more present on city roads.
Though autonomous vehicle companies operate in the private sector, she and other City officials have worked to establish a relationship with local company leaders so that they can discuss strategies to avoid factors that could lead to such a rebound effect. Some of that work, she said, includes making sure these cars don’t compete with current public transportation systems or preventing the cars from “traveling zombie miles, looking for people to pick up.”
But Clark also acknowledges that the landscape is still constantly shifting around autonomous vehicles, and that much of the regulatory process around them could remain unknown until closer to a full commercial launch. Nonetheless, she shares the concerns of both Donahue and Beckman, and feels that the City’s continued conversations with companies about this technology will resolve any issues in its adoption along the way.
“I think having these conversations early and often with the private sector ensures that we’re saying our expectations to them,” Clark said. “We want this technology to advance because we think it could save lives and make people safer and hopefully, make transportation a bit more sustainable.”

The Chinese tech giant shared its vision for mobility of the future in the form of a robocar, capable of Level 5 autonomous driving capabilities.The company also launched Kunlun 2, its second-generation AI chip aimed at areas including autonomous driving.Baidu has focused on diversifying its business beyond advertising to artificial intelligence and driverless cars.
Back in May this year, a commercial driverless taxi service was launched in China by the country’s biggest search engine player, Baidu. It was the first mass-produced robotaxi in China and Baidu did not slow down ever since. The company that has been building AI programs to power self-driving cars just unveiled its first “robocar” and a second-generation artificial intelligence chip for driverless vehicles.
Announced at its annual Baidu World conference recently, the AI-packed announcement showcases the company’s advances in an eight-year effort to develop autonomous-driving technology. It also underscores how these new areas of technology are key to the company’s future growth.
As described by CEO of Baidu himself Robin Li, “We believe that cars of the future will be robocars.” In fact, Baidu’s latest ‘robocar’ prototype is capable of Level 5 autonomous driving capabilities. “They will drive autonomously, act as both an intelligent assistant and loyal companion, and be self-learning,” he told an online audience.Dashveenjit Kaur |
Li believes intelligent vehicles of the future will be more like intelligent robots. “They will move, they will communicate, and they will learn. The robocar will not only be your vehicle, but also your driver, secretary, and personal assistant. It will drive automatically, understand your words, take orders and continuously learn from you and upgrade to serve you a more personalized experience,” he explained.
Baidu’s ‘robocar’
The robocar adopts a boxy shape and features gullwing doors as well as a transparent glass roof and a display at the front to visually communicate with its surroundings. The body is integrated with a suite of external sensors to enable its autonomous driving capabilities, which at Level 5, means the vehicle is capable of driving on its own under all conditions
As of now, there are no Level 5 autonomous vehicles being sold in the market, and most robotaxis being tested by other companies operate at Level 4, requiring certain conditions to be met before they can engage in autonomous driving. The robocar’s interior reflects its self-driving capabilities, as it contains zero-gravity seats, a widescreen curved display, and a control pad, with the steering wheel and pedals notably missing. 
Other tech bits here include voice and facial recognition, along with an advanced AI system that analyses the internal and external surroundings to provide predictive suggestions to proactively serve the needs of passengers.
The robocar, however, is still a prototype and the company has yet to confirm if it will be mass-produced. Even before revealing the robocar, Baidu already runs its Apollo robotaxi service in some cities in China and as of the end of the second quarter of this year, the service has provided more than 400,000 rides and driven more than 14 million km.
Baidu began developing autonomous driving tech in 2013, ahead of its competitors, and in 2017, it launched the Apollo open-source self-driving development platform. The platform has attracted Chinese government support as well as powerful partners like Toyota Motor and Volkswagen, along with tech companies Intel and Nvidia.
AI chip for self-driving technology
In 2018, Baidu launched its first-generation Kunlun chip. On Wednesday, during a conference, the company said it has begun mass producing Kunlun 2, its second-generation AI chip. The semiconductor is designed to help devices process huge amounts of data and boost computing power.
Baidu says the chip can be used in areas such as autonomous driving as it races to become a key player in the chip industry which Beijing is trying to strengthen. The new generation of Kunlun AI chips, using 7 nm process technology, achieved a top computational capability two to three times the previous generation, Baidu said in a statement.
Kunlun chips have been used mostly by Baidu in smart electric vehicles and cloud computing.

 Can the e-bicycle or the e-scooter be the answer to tackle congestion? Car makers think they have the answer 
By  S Muralidhar 
The pandemic and its fallout is going to have a profound impact on all our personal mobility needs and consequently on the automobile industry. The impact will unravel over the next few months, even as countries around the world and our own states around the country attempt to return to normalcy after the series of lockdowns.
 There are differing views on what might turn out to be the future mega trends within the automotive space, with opinions ranging from a surge in demand for new cars and bikes due to the continued fear of taking public transport, to a sharp rise in sales of low-cost options like used cars due to job losses and salary cuts. Contrarian views are also being expressed about the prospects of electric vehicles- with ones that say the heightened awareness about the environment could quicken the transition to EVs, while others are speculating that the crash in oil prices will end up delaying EV adoption.
Meanwhile, the fear of community transmission of this virus and the need for social distancing is going to stay with us for years to come. And if the new normal needs new tools for people to stay safe while seeking to commute to work or go shopping, they will eventually be developed by automobile companies.
 One of the conceptual product trends of last year that seems like the kind of thing that might find resonance in a post-pandemic world is the last mile mobility e-bike. An electric bike that can be folded or otherwise easily stored inside the car and can be used for scooting to locations that are a short distance away from your parked car. Or at other times can simply be ridden to a workplace that is not too far. 
The concept will find a lot of new takers amongst those who still seek the comfort and safety offered by personal mobility even after they need to step out of their cars. It could also help ease parking woes and congestion in city centres. For now, it is a mix of car companies that are launching branded electric bicycles to ride the rising wave of environment-consciousness amongst buyers (like Jeep) and others who are hoping to pair an e-bike or e-scooter with their future EVs. Here are a few examples of that are already available at showrooms and some that will make it in future vehicles. Will you be riding one too?
Audi e-tron scooter
Audi had officially unveiled the e-tron in India, its fully electric compact SUV, last year. While the final word on its Indian launch is still awaited, here’s something else the German luxury car maker has been working on.
The Audi e-tron Scooter, is meant for first mile and last mile connectivity. It combines the advantages of an electric scooter and the skateboard. It can be transported by car, bus or train, and the 12kg e-scooter can be folded up and conveniently stored in the back of the car, or if preferred pulled like a trolley. 
The 4-wheeled Scooter’s handling is said to be like surfing waves. Audi says that the rider has one hand free, and so is able to look around and give hand signals. Production and sales are planned for late 2020. The steering handle gives stability, holds the battery and the electronics, and carries a display showing the battery status. Riders can accelerate and brake by means of a twist grip.
 The range of 20kms is achieved through recuperation when the e-scooter brakes. The hydraulic foot brake provides additional safety. Audi had said that at the end of 2020, private customers will be able to buy the e-tron Scooter for about Euros 2,000. Audi also plans to offer it as an extra to customers who buy Audi e-tron models. The e-scooter could be charged in the car trunk through a dedicated socket.
 BMW E-Scooter The other German luxury car maker BMW had announced plans to develop a simple multi-modal mobility solution in the form of a e-scoot that could be easily folded and tucked away into its cars for use later The new BMW E-Scooter gets a range of twelve kilometres and a top speed of 20 kmph. Two separate braking systems and embedded front and rear lights provide the requisite safety on the road. 
This easily foldable scooter, weighs just nine kilograms and yet, boasts the space-saving design of a city scooter. The 150-watt motor and lithium-ion battery slip away almost out of sight into the footplate and rear wheel. It takes just two hours for a full charge of the E-Scooter’s battery. Created as part of the first collaboration between the BMW Group and Micro Mobility, there is also another lower priced adjustable BMW City Scooter option that allows the rider to take it with them everywhere thanks to its triple-secured folding and locking mechanism. It was launched last year and is said to retail for about Euro 800.
Hyundai and Kia
In a move that could benefit both sister brands Hyundai and Kia, the Hyundai Motor Group had last year announced that future vehicles, sporting either badge, may be offered with an in-built e-scooter. The new prototype electric scooter unveiled in mid-2019 is based on its initial concept presented at CES 2017. The model has rear-wheel drive, a lithium battery and stylish front and rear lights.
The latest concept features in future Hyundai Motor Group plans to enable first- and last-mile mobility by integrating the scooter with future vehicles.
When mounted on a vehicle, the scooter is charged automatically using electricity produced while driving, ensuring that the user can complete their journey seamlessly. The Group’s engineers have added suspension to the front wheel to provide a smoother ride, even on rough surfaces.
The latest version of Hyundai Motor Group’s e-scooter features a 10.5 Ah lithium battery. This enables the scooter to achieve a top speed of 20kmph and is sufficient to power the scooter for around 20kms on a single charge. Weighing around 7.7kgs, the scooter is highly portable, with its unique tri-folding design, it also features a digital display that shows battery status and speed; while, for nighttime riding, the scooter is equipped with two stylishly curved front LED headlights, and two rear tail lamps. The Group engineers plan to install a regenerative braking system to increase the scooter’s range by 7 per cent.
Jeep E-Bike
If adventure and sports is your focus, then this one is for you. The American brand that makes legendary off-road sports utility vehicles has been one of the latest entrants into the e-bike category. In keeping with the brand’s DNA, the Jeep E-Bike is a full suspension electric mountain bike that combines the versatility of a 4.8-inch fat tyre platform enabling it to tackle difficult off-road conditions including soft sand, snow and also hardpack trails and rocks. It’s 750W electric motor delivers 160Nm of torque via pedal assist or by using a thumb throttle. To handle rough off-road conditions, the ultra-stiff inverted front suspension fork comes with 150mm of travel and the rear wheel suspension travel is 120mm.
It also gets a 10-speed gear set and 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes which are paired with 203mm petal disc rotors. The Jeep E-Bike is a Class 2 electric bicycle under US classification rules and so it has a maximum speed limit of about 32kmph.
The Jeep E-Bike has been developed with specialist company QuietKat and it has a range of about 64kms on a full charge. The only figure that might deflate your enthusiasm may be the hefty sticker price of nearly $ 6,000. No information yet if Jeep India will officially bring this here.

Clean Air Express and Santa Barbara MTD give customers options to tap-to-ride as a result of a California Integrated Travel Project contactless payment demonstration. 

Clear Air Express buses and Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (MTD) buses are being outfitted with contactless payment options.  
The fare payment system is being made available as part of a six-month demonstration with the California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP), an initiative of the California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA) and California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to simplify travel by increasing access to public transit—including easier, faster payments via contactless credit/debit/prepaid cards and mobile wallets on smart devices. 
The contactless payment system for Santa Barbara MTD and Clean Air Express is the first to be introduced among public transit providers in the Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo tri-county region and one of the first three systems to be deployed statewide. The tap-to-ride system uses fare payment technology provided by Littlepay, Kuba, Cybersource and Elavon.  
“Older fare collection systems create unnecessary barriers for people to ride and choose transit,” said Marjie Kirn, executive director of Santa Barbara County Association of Governments, which operates the Clean Air Express. “With the new contactless payment system, customers can now pay their fare the same way they can buy a coffee or groceries by simply tapping a credit, debit card or using a mobile wallet on a smart phone or watch with no registration or account setup needed.” 
In addition to Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards with tap-to-pay capabilities, mobile payments options include Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay and Fitbit Pay. While registration or account setup will not be required to use the system, an online portal will be available to all customers paying with a card who need a receipt or would like to check their recent rides and fare payments. 
“We are excited to introduce this convenient payment option for our riders,” said Jerry Estrada, general manager of Santa Barbara MTD. “We’re piloting this technology on 10 of our buses, serving Lines 12x and 24x. This means you’ll be able to get to UCSB, Downtown Santa Barbara, Camino Real Marketplace and Old Town Goleta with a simple tap of a card or device.” 
Clean Air Express and Santa Barbara MTD customers will see contactless payment readers installed at the front of the designated buses. If a customer’s debit or credit card is valid and has the contactless symbol on it or if they use a mobile payment option, they can tap it on the payment reader, look for a green checkmark on the payment reader’s screen and take a seat to ride. 
“Much of our goal is a more modern and consistent transportation experience throughout California,” said Caltrans Director Toks Omishakin. “Allowing riders to pay for transit with the same methods they use elsewhere not only increases efficiency and mobility, but also reduces barriers to using public transportation.” 
Automatic fare capping enables both transit providers to offer riders the ability to pay-as-they-go to receive multi-ride discounts when riders tap to pay with the same contactless payment card or device throughout the day or within a 30-day period. 
Santa Barbara MTD customers pay the standard adult fare of $1.75. Riders using the same payment card or device with the new system will automatically not be charged more than $6 a day or $52 in a 30-day period, which is equivalent to purchasing a one-day or 30-day pass.  
Santa Barbara MTD buses with the contactless payment capability will have a special decal next to the front door of the bus, labeled with “Tap to Pay” and the contactless indicator symbol. 
Clean Air Express customers using the contactless payment system will be charged $6, a $1 discount from the standard $7 one-way cash fare. Existing Clean Air Express multi-ride fare discounts are honored with the new system, with riders automatically not being charged more than $10 per day—or $150 over 30 days—when using the same payment card or device. 
Clean Air Express and Santa Barbara MTD still accept physical passes and cash payments. The contactless payment option is just one more way to pay a fare—and to do so in a quick, secure way on both transit providers.

Last week, the Seoul Metropolitan Government announced that its city-wide public IoT network (Internet of Things) is on track to be completed by 2023, reported Korea Biz Wire. The operating platform is planned to be established at City Hall by the end of 2021.
The public IoT network aims to support and provide public services such as shared parking, smart street lights, and disappearance prevention through the use of IoT sensors.
The government will collect data related to traffic, safety, and the environment using these IoT sensors while enabling such data to be transmitted mutually to and from 25 district offices in the city.
Public IoT network based on LoRa
The LoRa-based trunk network will span 421 kilometers long, and be deployed across Seoul by the end of 2021. 
LoRa (long-range) is a low-power wireless telecommunication technology that connects sensors to the cloud. Based on the LoRaWAN® standard, it is capable of enabling real-time data and analytics communications. 
LoRa enables smart IoT solutions for low-powered devices and is used in energy management, natural resource reduction, pollution control, infrastructure efficiency, disaster prevention, and more.
As many as 1,000 IoT-exclusive LoRa base stations will be installed in public buildings such as community centers.
Of these, 195 are slated to be installed in the districts of Eunpyeong, Guro, and Seocho. These cities are currently carrying out pilot tests, whereas the other LoRa stations will be split across 19 district offices in 2022, and three district offices in 2023.
Public IoT network part of Seoul’s Smart City plans
These efforts to establish a city-wide IoT network are part of the Seoul government’s 102.7 billion won (US$ 85.8 million) investment into establishing a “Smart Seoul Network” (S-Net).
Unveiled in 2019, the plan was expected to unfold over three years. The government is addressing pain points in the city such as widely available, free public Wi-Fi (on the Wi-Fi 6 standard) covering 4,237 kilometers, with a priority on installation in densely-populated regions.
By 2022, they intend to increase the number of public Wi-Fi access points (APs) by over 200%. With over 6 million residents, the costs savings are expected to be immense. 
On a per-resident basis, the annual communications cost savings are projected to come up to 630,000 won (US$ 527) upon completion of the project. Annually, total savings in communications costs are expected to be around 3.88 trillion won (US$ 3.25 billion). 
Korea’s 5G to support its IoT efforts
Seoul’s IoT efforts seem right on time, as South Korea has established itself as an APAC leader in 5G deployment.
5G technology will be the key to help realize the full potential of IoT, as it promises high data rates, ultra-reliable transmission, and extremely low latencies. 
This is especially pertinent when it comes to Industrial 5G, which will improve efficiencies and flexibilities for industrial players, as well as critical industries.
South Korea an APAC leader in Smart City development
In 2020, Seoul launched the country’s first blockchain-based digital driver ID, with over a million drivers eagerly signing up for the service. 
Other than Seoul, South Korea has embarked on several other Smart City initiatives, with the most recent being the use of a decentralized identity system based on blockchain for citizen identity management in the city of Busan.
As part of Korea’s smart city strategy, the government has embarked on appointing special zones that have been strongly deregulated in the pursuit of various technological testing.
Busan’s blockchain zone is the latest in a series of “regulation-free zones” designated by the government in order to experiment with varying technologies and innovations. 
Six other zones have been established in various parts of the country. 
They include Gangwon-do (digital healthcare); Daegu City (smart wellness); Sejong City (autonomous driving); Jeollanam-do (e-mobility); Chungcheongbuk-do (smart safety control), and Gyeongsangnam-do (advanced battery recycling).

By Shubhankar GautamParking problems don’t end with the search for a parking spot. The costs associated with traditional parking systems are too exorbitant for the average citizen, altogether discouraging people from automobile usage, who are now resorting to alternative modes of commuting such as public transport and privately-owned shared car services just so they could avoid paying high parking costs. Let’s find out whether low parking costs encourage automobile use.
The Hidden Cost of Parking
‘Parking pain’ is a real thing. This collective term is used to include all stresses related to parking costs because the problem is not as shallow as the apparent cost of parking but has deeper roots. For instance – It often happens that drivers find it difficult to determine the exact time for which they might need a parking spot and to avoid exorbitant fines associated with parking violations; they end up making an overpayment. Moreover, certain parking garages have a very rigid rate card structure wherein a driver is required to make a minimum one-hour payment even when he needs to use the garage for just half of its time – 30 minutes.
If this wasn’t bad enough already, there are even bigger surprises. Too often hidden costs are completely excluded from the picture. For instance – INRIX Research compiled the world’s largest parking database where nearly 6,000 drivers from 10 of the busiest US cities were surveyed. The purpose of the research was to reveal the ‘actual cost of parking’ for drivers, the cities and their economy.
The shocking results of the survey stated that on average, American motorists spend 17 hours per year in search of a legal parking spot and the cost wasted per driver is an estimated $345 in fuel, time, and carbon emissions. Further, the research found that among the 10 US cities surveyed, the worst plight was that of New York drivers. In the Big Apple, drivers spent a whopping 107 hours per year on an average in search of a parking spot and the amount wasted in time, fuel, and carbon emissions per driver was $2,243! Such numbers are not sustainable.
Add to the above-mentioned numbers the cost of parking itself and it becomes absolutely clear as to why motorists are discouraged from using automobiles. When it comes to the cost of parking and its correlation to automobile usage, one can safely apply the basic ‘law of demand’ which states that all factors remaining the same, the demand for a product or a service is inversely proportional to its price. Similarly, as the cost of parking reduces, people feel more encouraged to use their vehicles.
The root of the cost problem, when looked deeply, lies in inefficient and obsolete traditional parking systems that have contributed both directly and indirectly to a hike in parking prices. Directly by not streamlining the parking scenario in a manner that is cost-effective and indirectly by acting as a breeding ground for the above-mentioned wastage of time and fuel and increased vehicular emissions.
Hence, to effectively deal with the cost problem, outdated parking systems need to be done away with, allowing a new-age technology to take over.
Smart Parking Technology: The Cost-Effective Solution
Fortunately, with the emergence and growth of IoT-based smart parking technology, the ax can be laid at the root of the issue. Since it was uninformed drivers going around in circles hunting for a parking spot who ended up wasting time, money, and fuel; IoT-based smart sensors and cameras relay necessary parking data such as availability of a parking spot and its exact location to the driver in real-time and in combination with advanced reservation features, they aid in eliminating traffic congestion, reducing driver stress, and avoiding unnecessary wastage of time and fuel. Moreover, since the system is automated, a driver can pay exactly for the time he ends up using the parking garage, unlike traditional parking systems where he chooses an overpayment over a parking ticket.
Drivers can also receive alerts so as to avoid taking routes that are overcrowded and can stick to less-traffic lanes for a quicker and more reliable trip. Naturally, when traffic congestion reduces, so does the harmful carbon emissions responsible for damaging the environment.
Final Thought: Low parking costs
So we see that low parking costs do encourage greater automobile usage but it is the use of smart parking technology equipped to streamline the parking scenario that not only a fair parking pricing system can be set in place but also hidden costs associated with parking can be eliminated.

 Air Methods, an air medical service provider, in the USA, has announced the launch of Spright, a newly formed drone solution designed to help improve healthcare access and minimize supply challenges. Collaborating with Wingcopter, Spright is creating a drone-based, healthcare-specific delivery network across the United States. As a result of the nation’s efforts to keep healthcare costs down, Americans are impacted by a lack of immediate or timely access to healthcare resources. When these shortages impact the availability of blood products, medicines, diagnostics or small medical devices, the consequences can be dire. 
The solution is a flexible, rapid distribution network designed with 21st-century technology. This new drone delivery network will improve access to urgently needed medical supplies for healthcare providers and the communities they serve. Air Methods will make this possible by deploying fleets of Wingcopter’s new flagship delivery drone, the Wingcopter 198. The team at Wingcopter has the proven technology and production capacity to enable Spright to create a nationwide network, built around Air Methods’ existing infrastructure of more than 300 bases, serving hundreds of hospitals, across 48 states in predominantly rural areas. 
“The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated some of the real challenges in our health care system creating an opportunity to find better solutions to extend access to healthcare, especially in rural America,” said JaeLynn Williams, CEO of Air Methods. “That is why we are doing what Air Methods’ does best, taking to the skies, using the latest in technology and drone innovation, delivering hope and facilitating healing with speed and efficiency that was previously unimaginable. We see Spright serving a vastly underserved market and playing a huge role in a future full of better outcomes for everyone.” This fall, Spright will be kicking off this endeavor by partnering with Hutchinson Regional Medical System, in Hutchinson, Kan., for the launch of an initial pilot project using Wingcopter’s delivery drones. This project will provide a proof of concept of how this new and exciting venture can provide needed relief and certainty for medical resources in rural America. Spright will provide additional details on this initial project as the deployment draws near. 
The Wingcopter 198 is an autonomous eVTOL delivery drone that enables safe, reliable, fast, and bi-directional medical deliveries. It is designed to provide maximum flexibility and ease of use in operations. The company’s patented tilt-rotor technology allows for vertical take-off and landing, while also enabling efficient forward flight over long ranges, thus eliminating the need for additional infrastructure. The drone has a range of up to 68 miles (110 kilometers), a maximum speed of 90 mph (145 kilometers per hour) and can carry a payload of up to 13 lbs. (6 kg). 
“We are thrilled to team up with Air Methods to create a life-saving drone delivery network throughout the United States,” said Tom Plümmer, Co-Founder and CEO of Wingcopter. “Our technology has been used globally to effectively deliver medical supplies, for example insulin in Ireland, children’s vaccines in Vanuatu, emergency medication in Malawi, and just recently, blood samples in Germany. Our vision to ‘save and improve lives’ resonates perfectly with Air Methods’ legacy of providing lifesaving care, combined with Spright’s ambition to improve the quality of healthcare across the U.S. by deploying fleets of Wingcopters, and we are excited about scaling this together.”

In many ways, trucks are a more viable focal point for the development of the artificial intelligence (AI) for fully-autonomous driving.
The global trucking industry is worth $700 billion annually, and trucking is the number one occupation in no less than 29 U.S. states. In addition, the sector has emerged as the key battleground in the development of automated driving.
The efforts of tech engineers had focused on the quest to build commercially-viable driverless automobiles, but in the last year there has been a shift toward the commercial vehicle sector. This shift can be seen in several key partnerships that have been signed between tech startups and the world’s largest truck manufacturers.
Waymo, often seen as the leader in driverless technology, has partnered with Daimler, the biggest truck manufacturer in the world. Meanwhile, TuSimple is teaming up with Traton, a subsidiary of Volvo, and Aurora — which is backed by Amazon and has recently acquired all of Uber’s self-driving tech — has joined forces with Volvo and Paccar. 
In many ways, trucks are a more viable focal point for the development of the artificial intelligence (AI) for fully-autonomous driving. Long haul vehicles travel on long, monotonous highways, whereas the urban mobility navigated by automobiles and robotaxis is more complex.
The difficulty with developing the AI, centers around what engineers refer to as “edge cases” – those unique scenarios that are rarely encountered in your average vehicle journey. Put simply, there are more edge cases for the AI to deal with in complex urban environments.
Could the trucking industry reap the benefits of autonomy ahead of other vehicle sectors?
Cost savings with AT
There is a strong commercial case for greater investment in AT. One factor is the current limitation on human driver hours for safety reasons, which limits journeys to eleven hours. With autonomous trucking, the vehicle could be on the road for longer periods. It’s estimated that a trip from New York to L.A. could be cut from five days to two, resulting in significant cost savings.
AT is also being touted as a possible solution to the shortage of truck drivers. Although two-thirds of all U.S. consumer goods are transported by trucks, the American Trucking Association (ATA) predicts the driver shortage will reach 160,000 by 2028. By investing in greater levels of autonomy, the industry can solve the driver shortage while continuing to meet growing demand for deliveries.
According to advocates of AT, AI-based cruise control will save up to 10% in fuel costs. The optimized driving judgement of the AI can yield other savings, from reduced tire and brake wear to lower maintenance and insurance costs.  The process of optimizing journeys will make further improvements as the AT will gather data from journeys and use this to enhance fuel efficiency.
How exactly will AT work? Rather than automating the entire journey, the current plan is for a hub-to-hub approach. This means the autonomous, or semi-autonomous, heavy goods vehicle would transport goods from one depot to another, along a relatively straightforward route. The more complex last mile of the delivery would then be performed by a human driver.
A common approach to the development of AT is the development of a computer ‘driver’. This can be retrofitted to an existing vehicle, rather than having to develop an entirely new vehicle from scratch. For example, autonomous start up Aurora – which has agreed to partnerships with Volvo and Paccar – has been developing a one-size-fits all system that can be installed on any vehicle.
The importance of conventional components
Vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have always demanded high quality components. These vehicles must travel immense distances in all manner of weather conditions, placing significant demands on steering and suspension parts.
To be ready for the AT future, component manufacturers may need to raise their game. According to 2019 data from the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, 538 out-of-service (OOS) violations were discovered during vehicle checks, in addition to a further 1,000 non-OOS violations. Problems included suspension defects or steering-related problems. The most common steering-related defects were when components were found to be worn, welded or even missing.  
Although relatively rare, reducing the risk of component defects is of growing importance, as AT must demonstrate the highest levels of reliability and safety to become commercially viable.
It is not enough to demonstrate that an autonomous vehicle is as safe as a human driver, as can be seen from some of the high-profile accidents that have undermined efforts to develop driverless tech in other vehicle sectors. Whether we are talking about a steering universal joint or steering columns, opting for high quality parts helps reduce the risks of defects.
A decade ago, few would have predicted that long haul trucking would have been the focal point of new autonomous driving technologies. Now, the sector looks like it will reap the benefits of autonomy ahead of other vehicle sectors. Although the main focus will be on software development and testing of AI, parts suppliers also need to contribute by making sure their components will meet the unique challenges these vehicles will face.

Maintenance costs are among the highest operational costs for fleets, behind only fuel and truck payments when it comes to vehicle-based costs, according to the American Transportation Research Institute’s most recent Operational Costs of Trucking report.
One way to help control maintenance costs is for fleets to mitigate the chances of unscheduled roadside maintenance. As reported earlier this month, the American Trucking Associations’ Technology and Maintenance Council found the average distance driven between unscheduled roadside repairs fell nearly 19% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Marco Encinas, director of product management for fleet telematics provider Teletrac Navman, said fleets can use their existing telematics systems to help keep unscheduled maintenance in check.
He noted that the rise in unscheduled maintenance had a lot to do with the high freight demand during the pandemic, along with the current ongoing parts shortage.
“The one thing that we did see was a huge increase in vehicles, specifically OTR vehicles, during the COVID pandemic,” Encinas said. “Everybody was home, but the transportation industry was busier than ever. They had to keep trucks running as much as possible. It seems like some of the operators let some of that normal maintenance behavior sort of lax in order to get productivity out of their trucks and keep them on the road.”
On a day-to-day basis, Encinas said fleets should make sure their truck drivers are conducting required pre-and post-trip inspections each day, and help drivers better understand what to look for.
“It helps you schedule your maintenance for things that won’t take you off the road immediately, but you definitely have to get addressed sooner rather than later,” he said.
Utilizing tools from telematics service providers can also help drivers, as they allow fleets to customize a checklist of things to go over in addition to their normal inspections.
“When you do those pre-trip and post-trip inspections and actually do the work…that will get you ahead of any kind of maintenance issues and put you in the preventive maintenance mode rather than reactive,” Encinas said. “Then you can selectively take the truck off the road to get stuff done when it’s not necessarily scheduled to be earning any revenue.”
Encinas noted that Teletrac Navman’s system has a maintenance module that allows fleets to schedule routine maintenance for equipment based on miles driven that will alert the driver and maintenance department when the truck needs service.
Another usage case for telematics is keeping track of maintenance costs for each piece of equipment a fleet operates.
“It also helps you keep control of your costs and account for the costs that are going into maintaining your vehicles,” he said. “So, one thing is to do the daily maintenance and preventive maintenance of your vehicles to keep them on the road, but the other piece is now you can start looking at are you putting in more money into these vehicles in yearly maintenance than they’re generating? Maybe it’s time to swap out your truck and get a new one.”
One thing Encinas said Teletrac Navman has been working on, and continues to work on, is incorporating maintenance and productivity data of trucks as they run to determine the best time to schedule them for maintenance.
“There’s things that we’re doing on the telematics side to add more intelligence rather than run static reporting and static alerts, but also put more intelligence into it and help you make better decisions about when to take that truck in and stay ahead of the preventive maintenance.”

The time we live in, the present, is the most technically advanced it has ever been. With these new technologies come advancements in every business area, from customer-facing technologies to predictive inventory to transportation management.
Smart technology is transforming the way companies do business — including an impact on your company, whether you realize it or not. Businesses are very swiftly implementing AI and IoT to streamline operations and optimize data. This technology has already entered the forefront in major cities, and it’s quickly making its way into transportation management as well.
How will AI and IoT transform transportation management? And what does this mean for your business and clients?
What Are IoT and AI?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is when machines reflect a learning pattern to grow their knowledge through learning. These machines recognize patterns and collect data to analyze, predict, and track future changes. AI helps automate learning to make smarter, safer, faster decisions in businesses.
According to Stanford’s Artificial Intelligence and Life In 2030 — One Hundred Year Study, AI will have a massive impact on all forms of infrastructure. From city public transportation to rural sewage systems to transportation management, AI can collect and process data faster than humans can. This has a major impact on the way businesses understand data and create strategies.
IoT refers to the Internet of Things. This is basically the network of all devices that are connected to exchange data. Connected devices include vehicles, home appliances, electronics, shipping boxes, robots, and even credit cards, and many more. The limits for connectivity are endless. In fact, there are currently 17 billion connected devices, and it’s predicted that this will rise to 50 billion in the next two years.
IoT is the wave of the future with regards to transportation management. Analysts predict that 70–75% of new cars will feature IoT connectivity by 2022. And this is only with commercial use; in the shipping and logistics sector, connectivity could reach as high as 90%. This is because AI and IoT can optimize processes in ways that companies could never before have imagined.
How does it benefit us?
Autonomous Vehicles
Autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles have already driven onto the transport scene. Artificial intelligence enables trucks to sense their location and other objects around them to drive with appropriate speeds and directions. From Uber’s self-driving car to Tesla’s Semi, autonomous vehicles are quickly becoming the wave of the future.
Currently, self-driving cars aren’t fully autonomous. Rather, they function like “auto-pilot,” allowing drivers to sit in the passenger seat to do paperwork or sleep while the truck is driving itself. This lack of full-autonomy is largely to do with social and government pushback.
However, IoT is making it easier for self-driving vehicles to be fully autonomous through interconnectivity with warehouses, route planners, and delivery checkpoints. This will make these trucks safer and more efficient than even trained drivers themselves.
Moreover, connected robots and drones are quickly entering the scene as new methods of autonomous delivery. This will especially have an impact on last-mile logistics and eCommerce.
Streamlined Decision Making
IT experts say that connected or autonomous vehicles are attractive because of the technologies that reinforce them. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one part of the equation. The other part is artificial intelligence (AI). It acts as the driver, helping the connected ‘thing’ (could be a vehicle or inventory system) make smarter decisions.
As applied to transportation management, automated decision-making ability is crucial. Connected vehicles, shipments, and systems help with tracking and historical reporting. But real-time insights and responses take place through artificial Intelligence.
Strong Analytics
This tracking and reporting software doesn’t just allow companies to have a history of their trucks and shipments. Artificial intelligence can then analyze this data to create predictive forecasts.
This constant data analysis can help identify inefficiencies in planning, inventory, stocking, loading, unloading, and even among the workforce. It can then help create a strategy to create more efficient processes.
Warehouse Management
Artificial intelligence and IoT connected devices have already made their way into several warehouses, including Amazon’s e-commerce warehouses. For example, robot workers can pick faster and follow high levels of quality control.
RFID tags are also changing the inventory game. RFID tags are connected to the cloud and share data on a given package or pallet location. This means the staff doesn’t need to scan every item for inventory or delivery. They can load and unload the containers, and the RFID automatically updates the inventory in real-time.
This saves significant time and money while improving the accuracy of stock-keeping. In fact, RFID tags can maintain 95% accurate inventory, while the average inventory rate floats around 65%. Because of these numbers, nearly 96% of major retailers are planning on adopting RFID tech tags.

Streamlined Process
AI studies multiple factors at once, while IoT connects everything at once. This creates a holistic analysis of all areas of transportation management.
Together, AI and IoT can look at the warehouse floor temperature, inventory, safety, and equipment performance. They can link warehousing with loading procedures, where sensors can determine the utilization rate of trucks. This can then be linked to transport, where semi-autonomous trucks provide ongoing updates about location and safety.
Then, AI can determine the speed of unloading and last-mile delivery.
This links together to optimize routing and planning. AI and IoT can analyze multiple facets of data to make processes more efficient from A to Z.
Slashed Costs
All of these benefits together can help minimize costs. AI and IoT reduce inefficiencies that throw money out the window. They can also help reduce:
• Gas costs by avoiding traffic or stalling.• Insurance costs by making trucking safer.• Salaries, since drivers can do work and sleep while on the road.• Replacement costs because IoT can quickly alert to maintenance issues.
Reduced costs mean a stronger bottom line for retailers and transport companies alike.
Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things disrupt logistics and transportation management by making logistics operations smarter day by day. It is expected that delays in pickups/deliveries and trucking capacity concerns will be a matter of the past when AI and IoT come into the picture.
IoT and AI are the technologies of the future and expanding at a speed like never before. Every business, small scale, or larger enterprises will greatly impact these smart technologies.

Autonomous cars have been in the works for many years. They hold promise for the future as efficient methods of transportation, however, the main setback is safety. To get autonomous vehicles into the public sphere, manufacturers need to ensure that they are not only just as safe as standard vehicles but a step above that safety level.
Now, through the use of artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous vehicles are getting the improvements they need.
AI for Vehicle Safety
According to a Stanford study from 2013, roughly 90% of vehicle crashes are due to human error, at least in part. The idea for a solution, then, is to remove the possibility for human error by automating vehicles to operate on their own. That way, the vehicle can drive smoothly and keep the driver, other drivers and pedestrians safe.
Of course, before you can operate an autonomous vehicle, they must have the highest safety standards as well. Detection systems offer the first steps of a solution. Sensors and cameras on autonomous cars can monitor and detect where other vehicles and pedestrians are in proximity to the car. Still, these vehicles need more than standard detectors.
AI is now improving up the foundation of these safety systems. Artificial intelligence algorithms consistently learn from past experience, whether they were successes or failures. Then, when the system finds itself in similar situations, it can act accordingly.
As more and more AI-enabled vehicles start coming into play, they can all be continuously learning, reducing vehicle crashes that come from human error.
New Models Using AI
With AI’s powerful evolving nature, researchers and car manufacturers are working on new vehicle models that integrate the latest technology for safety. Notably, a team of researchers at the Technical University of Munich are working on perfecting an AI safety detection system. This system will notify drivers seven seconds in advance that they must retake control over the wheel.
The AI system learns from the driver’s past behavior. For instance, whenever you have retaken the wheel in the past is a data point that the system will learn from. Then, when it recognizes similar situations while you’re driving, it can notify you seven seconds in advance that you should start steering again.
Researchers working on the project state that they need more data for this breakthrough to become widely used. However, they also state that, from the study trials, the system is 85% accurate with its predictions and notifications.
As this technology becomes more widely available, it can help distracted drivers, alerting them away from the distraction and back on the road. Thus, AI will ultimately be reducing car crashes through its integration with autonomous cars.
Future Improvements
Some autonomous vehicles are already using AI to operate. While not entirely self-driving, Tesla models, for instance, have an autopilot function that assists drivers on the road. Newer vehicles are taking this integration a step further, too.
The electric LF-Z model from Lexus uses AI to help drivers get around, keeping them safe in the process. The car enables AI-generated dialogue to communicate with the driver about routes, traffic and safety. The system also continuously learns from the driver’s habits and behaviors to assist them further.
A model like this one, combined with the AI breakthrough from Germany could be a big step forward. It could be something you see on the roads in the next few years.
You may also see some 5G-enabled vehicles soon, too. These vehicles, using AI, can help speed up data transmission on the road. That way, your vehicle could communicate with others, constantly learning to keep everyone safe.
A New Autonomous Direction
With the breakthrough at the Technical University of Munich and the newer smart car models coming into play, autonomous vehicles are taking on a refreshed direction. Their path is gaining more and more support, safety and practically with each new innovation. Now, the future is becoming more clear — AI in autonomous cars is a game-changer.

A COMMON perception is that time wasted due to being stuck in traffic, or when trying to find a parking space, could have been saved if your car was a fully self-driving (FSD) vehicle.
We have been waiting for autonomous vehicles (AVs) for quite some time after all the statements made by companies involved in AV production.
The truth is, the perception about wasted minutes is wrong.
AV will still take time as it follows the best route possible to get to your destination, just like what you do by following the best route selection guide from Waze or Google Map.
The only difference is that in AVs, you need not focus on driving. You can do other things like attending to Facebook and Instagram, reading your paperwork, watching YouTube or movies, or simply sleeping until you reach your destination.
According to the Society of Automotive Engineers, to operate a FSD vehicle, not only do the autonomous cars need to communicate with the infrastructure and other cars around them, they should also fully understand their surroundings.
To ensure safety, AVs must understand and react to situations based on traffic cultures, which vary from one place to another.
For example, in rules and regulations, both written and non-written, which are widely accepted in society; the quality of education (what people learn as they grow up), including moral and ethical matters; how effective is enforcement (strictness of law); and finally, the road system design.
Autonomous cars are being tested around the world, but there have been a number of accidents, making the idea of training artificial intelligence (AI) the priority in understanding diverse situations and reactions.
By having a clear guide map, AVs can predict reactions and act on them, becoming an integrated part of the traffic system.
Tesla and its chief executive officer, Elon Musk, have long been criticised for overstating the capabilities of the company’s Autopilot system. Terms like “Autopilot” and FSD have contributed to an environment in which Tesla customers are misled into believing that their vehicles can actually drive themselves.
Due to the latest accidents involving Autopilot vehicles, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration now requires companies like Tesla and Alphabet’s Waymo to report incidents involving driver assistance and autonomous systems within one day of learning of a crash, signalling a tougher stance by regulators.
Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group that represents all the major automakers and their suppliers, excluding Tesla, released a statement that singled out “misuse and abuse” of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).
It said it is critical that consumers know and understand the benefits and limitations of these features to build and improve confidence in proven vehicle safety technologies.
Misuse and abuse of Level 2 ADAS systems is extremely dangerous and threatens consumer acceptance and confidence in vehicles equipped with potentially life-saving ADAS technologies.
Another trade group, the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, which represents AV companies, including Waymo, Argo, Aurora, Cruise and others, echoed similar concerns.
But they stated there must be a distinction between their members’ autonomous vehicles, which do not require human intervention to operate safely, and driver-assistance technology like Tesla’s, which requires an attentive driver.
Let us not forget that AVs still have a long way to go before they get there. Rules and regulations must be in place, infrastructure must be ready, even the weather conditions must be considered.
It is better to “assume the worst and design for that” and not rely on the technology promising safety. The question then is, who benefits the most from an AV?
With AVs, transport businesses no longer need to employ people to drive vehicles, thus saving tremendously on salaries, medical insurance and other costs. Thousands, even millions of drivers will be out of job as these companies maximise their profits.

For the giant tech companies, supplying AV software and hardware to auto makers means a new, huge revenue stream turning their multi-billion companies into trillion-dollar companies.
So it is clear that tech companies and companies in the transport business will gain the most from the AV industry.

We live in an age where nearly everything we use is “smart.” Our devices have long had the capability to bring the data of the world to our fingertips. Still, now the smart capabilities have extended to once-mundane parts of our lifestyles like household appliances and modes of transportation. As such, it is not only our personal lifestyles that are becoming “smart,” but they are extending to affect our cities and our nations, developing into “smart cities.”
A smart city takes the idea of smart technology and expands it on a tremendous scale. The city will use technology and connectivity to provide services and solutions to address societal needs: improve social and economic welfare, reduce environmental pollution and waste, improve safety and security policies, and open these services and solutions to be inclusive to all.
Smart Mobility
Many smart city projects center around the topic of mobility and transportation. This makes sense as mobility is one area where most, if not all, people participate or need to participate in some way or form. There are many successful use cases where smart cities are implementing mobility projects, using machine learning and AI to analyze data patterns and improve life for their residents. For example, in 2012, Pittsburgh’s city implemented Surtrac, an intelligent traffic signaling system, reducing travel times and emissions by optimizing vehicles’ movement through intersections. Analysis of the project found that the average travel times reduced by 25%, and cars spent up to 40% less time idling. This affected not only citizens’ quality of life but also the environment by reducing emissions.
This is just one example of how a smart city benefits its citizens. Still, smart cities are not just about how the city’s government officials can provide the infrastructure, services, and solutions to benefit its citizens. If that were the core point, it would simply be a digital city, not necessarily smart. A smart city’s very essence depends on its people to improve its services with gathered data, making it more efficient, more inclusive, and more secure.
Simply put, if the city’s residents do not participate or have the ability to participate, then the smart city is… at the end of the day, not so smart. While many cities are well on their way to planning their smart cities, when it comes to providing smart mobility and transportation systems to all, they forget about a key demographic: those with disabilities and mobility challenges.
Research shows that by 2050, 68% of the world’s population will likely live in urban areas, and of those people, roughly 15% will be those with disabilities: around 937.5 million people. Many people can relate to the benefits of living in an urban community: faster and often easier access to basic needs like healthcare, essential household needs, and transportation. However, for those with disabilities, getting from point A to point B is not as easy as it sounds.
Think of the different modes of transportation available: walking, biking, driving a personal vehicle, taxi, fixed-route transits (think subways or buses), ridesharing, carsharing. These methods are not necessarily easy or efficient for those with disabilities to utilize. With difficulty even finding a method of transportation, it’s said that 28% of those with disabilities rarely even leave their homes.
I mentioned earlier that if a city’s residents do not or cannot participate in the smart city, they are not actually becoming “smarter” because it is not fully meeting its goal. This is exemplified perfectly when it comes to the lack of smart mobility solutions accessible to those with disabilities. To get back on track of becoming a smart city, mobility and related infrastructure need to be barrier-free. Barrier-free refers to designing infrastructure and services that are inclusive to all, including those with physical or other disabilities.
Some critics may say that barrier-free mobility is already available. After all, we call “paratransit” or DRT (Demand Responsive Transport) services available for those who may need extra assistance in many metropolitan areas. However, I would argue that this is a grey area where many may fall prone to believing that this is an easy fix. While paratransit does offer more accessibility to people with disabilities, they’re often at a high cost with limited service (availability of vehicles, operational hours, distance, etc.).
On average, door-to-door paratransit service costs between $45 and $50, increasing with longer distances and time. This is not something that many with disabilities can afford regularly. Paratransit and DRT also depend on the vehicle to arrive at a specific time, and with issues like traffic or weather conditions, there can be delays or even no-shows. While being unable to catch a cab might not seem like an issue for many, for those with disabilities, it can be the difference between making it to a crucial health appointment or their work, a line of financial stability.
Short-term: Start with Utilizing Machine Learning and AI
While there’s no panacea to solving today’s mobility issues – that’s not to say that there are no ways to begin to implement changes to make mobility more accessible, inclusive, and barrier-free. We can ensure that DRTs can become more accessible to ensure that the operations are being optimized to reduce costs, lessen wait times, and increase dispatch capabilities to ensure that passengers can find rides when they need them.
This is where the core theme of the smart city comes in. By collecting data and utilizing machine learning technology, DRT services can utilize fleet management systems to dispatch drivers to passengers, reducing idle wait times for both parties. A smart dispatch feature within the fleet management system can also consider traffic conditions and real-time driver availability and location to more accurately predict arrival times, ensuring that there are fewer mix-ups and delays for both the driver and passenger.
Utilizing a fleet management platform will allow DRT and paratransit services to continue to operate at reduced costs. As the service becomes increasingly optimized, the services can expand the operation areas to allow more vehicles and more passengers to become a part of the service. There are numerous other ways that data and machine learning can allow seamless barrier-free mobility services, but it shouldn’t end there.
Long-Term: Expand Barrier-Free Mobility Into Other Infrastructure and Policy
When the goal is to ensure inclusion, a smart city’s solution to accessible mobility can’t just end at paratransit and DRT services. Accessibility and inclusivity need to expand to other modes of transportation, allowing for a more diverse experience and economic relief.
Thankfully, there are cities and organizations that are considering this challenge as they plan their infrastructure and services. For example, in 2020, Google Maps rolled out a new feature showing wheelchair-friendly routes, also adding on a feature where anyone can contribute accessibility information to the application.
Going further, with headlines of autonomous and connected vehicles beginning to hit the roads, we can also consider how autonomous driving technology can bring more inclusivity into mobility. Although the technology for fully autonomous vehicles is still in development, there are other developments underway. In 2016, the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research developed a self-driving wheelchair to navigate Singapore’s Changi General Hospital. And more recently, WHILL, a “personal EV” company, announced that it would be providing self-driving wheelchairs at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan. Perhaps one day, this can also translate into autonomous passenger vehicles geared towards aiding those with disabilities.
In the meantime, the barrier-free mindset needs to become a part of policy development. While there may be overarching regulations stating that accessibility is a must for public infrastructure, with the digital and connected infrastructure development changes, accessibility isn’t often considered when planning to change over to a smart city structure. Research labs, organizations, and companies can do their part to bring inclusivity to the forefront of these technological advances. Still, it can go even faster with policy on our side.
Conclusion
Having inclusive smart cities should be synonymous with providing accessible mobility to all. It’s not only essential to fulfilling the other goals of having safety and security, social and economic wellness, and contributing to a greener world; it is a basic human right to be mobile and be able to experience economic benefits and a sustainable, active standard of life. While it may take time and purposeful planning, to become a smart city and even a smart world––we have to put people first. The city will follow.

By strategically incorporating various mobility services, The COMET seamlessly addresses unmet needs of the community by providing specialized services for niche groups previously underserved by traditional fixed route and paratransit services. 
By Megan Perrero
When John Andoh* was hired as CEO and executive director of the Central Midlands Regional Transit Authority (The COMET), (CANADA) in 2018, the board said the system had become stagnant; ridership had started to plateau and there were several unmet needs regarding service offerings. So, Andoh set out to find innovative ways to integrate different mobility options to address food deserts, expand nighttime transit hours, connect people to employment centers, provide first-and-last-mile connections and expand service options for seniors and people with disabilities. 
“That was the catalyst of what got us to start looking at how we could be more of a mobility manager,” said Andoh. 
In about three years, The COMET has addressed all these unmet needs by introducing new mobility options, implementing technology upgrades, pursuing discretionary funding and leveraging partnerships. The COMET can now seamlessly provide specialized trips for niche groups previously underserved by the traditional fixed route and paratransit system by integrating these various mobility services. 
COMET on the GO with TNC Partnerships  
Andoh explains the frequency and layout of The COMET’s system created gaps in nighttime service and was “just not connecting people effectively to grocery stores.”  
Instead of accepting the status quo, Andoh began brainstorming of something that would be a low-cost solution and easy to get off the ground quickly. The answer? Establishing a partnership with Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) Uber and Lyft to offer a new mobility service, COMET on the Go!  
“We went one step further and came up with a creative idea that nobody [was] really thinking about before,” Andoh said.  
While TNC partnerships primarily focus on first-and-last-mile connections, this program is unique in that it addresses nighttime service gaps with COMET @ Night and food equity with COMET to the Market. To do this, the agency partnered with Uber and Lyft in January 2019 to subsidize rideshare trips that started by providing promotional codes for $5.00 discounts that increased to $8.00 in January 2021. Both services run seven days a week, with the nighttime service operating from 9:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. and the grocery service operating from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. The services integrate with Catch The COMET and Transit mobile apps. 
To better address food equity, COMET to the Market solely provides rideshare trips to grocery stores for people who live in food deserts as designated by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, improving food equity by removing barriers to people getting to grocery stores on a regular basis. The agency identified every grocery store with meat and produce in the area, so people can choose where they shop instead of limiting them to their neighborhood store.  
Pre-pandemic, ridership was growing, “and that was our mechanism of success—that we are truly helping connect people to grocery stores,” Andoh said.  
Another success to come from these TNC partnerships, specifically with the night program, is the cost savings. Instead of seeing TNCs as competitors, Andoh explains The COMET views TNCs as complementary to transit since it is more cost-effective for them to use cars for door-to-door trips versus running a network of buses carrying less than 1.5 passengers per hour.  
“Launching these programs allowed us to demonstrate that we are returning value to the penny sales tax [which was approved by voters in 2012],” Andoh said.   
Blue Bike Comes to Downtown  
Since The COMET’s TNC partnerships focus on other types of trips, the agency has leveraged bikeshare to bridge first-and-last-mile connections in the downtown area. Blue Bike, launched in January 2019, is owned by the city of Columbia, S.C., contracted to Bewegen and operated and maintained by the agency. The vision for the service was to be “truly integrated” into the rest of the system and not just a “standalone service,” explains Andoh. 
Riders have access to 18 stations throughout downtown Columbia and can purchase passes via the six kiosks throughout the bikeshare system using credit, debit and Visa or MasterCard gift cards or riders can also use their COMET Card or the Blue Bike mobile app. These options ensure accessibility for all by catering to people who don’t have a debit or credit card, or access to a smartphone. As a bonus, COMET users can get free, unlimited 45-minute rides.  
“We treat Blue Bike almost like a bus route because you can just tap your COMET Card on the kiosk and get that free bike,” Andoh said.  
Blue Bike is also integrated into all the platforms customers use to plan and pay for their trip, such as Catch The COMET App (Passport) that not only allows users to purchase bus fares, passes for paratransit, trip plan with real-time arrival information but also link to social media, Blue Bikes and the city. The COMET has also partnered with moovit and Transit to offer a Mobility-as-a-Service app, where passengers can check the status of Blue Bike stations, access real-time arrival information and purchase fares and passes. Real-time arrival information is provided via TransLoc. 
Vanpool Brings Transit to Employers 
The COMET’s Vanpool Program, operated by Enterprise, provides access to employment sites that are beyond the fixed-route transit system and allow commuters to set their desired commute, explains Andoh. However, the agency approached this service a bit differently than other vanpool programs.  
“We wanted Enterprise to go to employment sites that were not in the common fixed-route service area and sell the concept of transit to them, [saying] we’ll promote this van to your employees [and] we’ll pay that $500 towards the van. You help us in getting people to use the service,” Andoh said.  
This approach allows them to test the concept of transit and can be a potential catalyst to creating an express bus route if The COMET sees a large group of people regularly going to one employment site. Several employers have jumped at the opportunity of implementing a fixed bus route, such as Fort Jackson, McEntire Produce and Michelin.  
“Before, they had nothing,” Andoh said. “They didn’t know how to reach out to us on how to get something when the question was asked. And it also allowed them to reach out to people for job recruitment from areas where they couldn’t [before] because they [had] a lack of transportation.” 
Increased Access for Seniors and People with Disabilities 
Just as new services and technology is important, so is leveraging partnerships and grant funding explains Andoh, who tasked the agency’s grants and regional coordination manager to slow down their penny spending and explore other discretionary funds. Andoh adds the manager has been pretty successful in getting grant funding. One example is the Federal Transit Administration grant that was awarded for The COMET’s volunteer mileage reimbursement program and a subsidized transportation program.  
The agency partnered with Able South Carolina to launch the Volunteer Transportation Program (V-Trip) and the Taxi Voucher Pick Up Program (PUP) in January 2021 to provide better access to transportation for seniors and persons with disabilities underserved by the present transit system. V-Trip reimburses 57.5 cents per mile, up to 100 miles each month. PUP gives a $50 subsidy on taxi or ridershare (Uber and Lyft) trips each month. The services are operated 24 hours a day and are offered to people who live outside the agency’s service area, live in Richland or Lexington Counties and live inside the Columbia urbanized area.  
Another discretionary grant awarded to The COMET in partnership with Foenix Mobility is the Innovative Coordinated Access and Mobility (ICAM) Grant, which will increase access to healthcare services for residents.  
“We’re going to be utilizing their technology to connect seniors, persons with disabilities and low-income folks to healthcare in a more seamless manner,” Andoh said. “Foenix Mobility is also putting together an app to help people who need access to the pharmacy or medical or dental appointment [to] match them to whatever available transportation option is available to them.” 
In addition to more specialized services and mobile app, The COMET is also updating its technology offerings for its paratransit service. The agency has been working with TripSpark to migrate to its Passenger Portal that integrates with Trapeze PASS to provide notifications and allow customers to reserve and cancel their paratransit trips. 
Niche Services Boost Public’s Perception of Transit 
By tailoring services to niche demographics and providing user-friendly technology to access them, the agency is able to not only provide a more efficient, individualized service but also attract riders who may not ride a fixed busroute, but would use Comet @ Night to get home after dinner. And this has helped the public change its perception of what public transit can do. By being active in the community, Andoh describes how people are seeing the agency in a new light and as a way to enrich lives of residents.  
“People are starting to see The COMET as progressive and see it as valuable in offering mobility options in moving people from A to B versus this public service tax subsidy that’s not providing any value,” Andoh said. “People are seeing The COMET is truly a good community partner. If there’s an idea [that’s] pitched to me, we will try to find a way to make a transit component to it so that we can be a part of it.”

Researchers say the future of transportation will be shaped by three “revolutions” – vehicle electrification, driverless cars and ride-sharing – that could result in fewer automobiles on the road, less fossil fuels extracted from the Earth and less pollution in the air. While the environmental gains may seem self-evident, the health benefits are difficult to quantify.
Now for the first time, a Cornell-led team has used transdisciplinary systems modeling to calculate those health benefits in the United States. By 2050, these innovations could potentially slash petroleum consumption by 50% and carbon dioxide emissions by 75% while simultaneously preventing 5,500 premature deaths, with an annual savings of $58 billion.
“There are all these important emerging trends in the development of transportation, and they are becoming a reality in the near future,” said Oliver Gao, the Howard Simpson Professor of civil and environmental engineering in the College of Engineering, who led the project.
“Have you ever thought about what all these revolutions mean for your health, for our climate, and for our environment, and for our energy systems?” Gao said. “These externalities don’t necessarily come directly in the mind of the general public, the travelers, or even the decision-makers.”
The group’s paper, “Shared Use of Electric Autonomous Vehicles: Air Quality and Health Impacts of Future Mobility in the United States,” published June 26 in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. The paper’s lead author is former postdoctoral researcher Shuai Pan.
“It is worthwhile to understand the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies, as deep de-carbonization is needed in the transportation sector,” Pan said.
Co-authors include Lewis M. Fulton from the University of California, Davis, and Yunsoo Choi and Jia Jung from the University of Houston. The research was supported by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Center for Transportation, Environment and Community Health, and by Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology.
While previous studies have looked at certain facets of transportation innovation, such as the impact of electric vehicles on fuel usage and emissions, this is the first time anyone has employed a transdisciplinary systems approach that factored in human health and the associated economic benefits, according to Gao.
Gao’s systematics research group – which uses modeling to understand complex global challenges in engineering, business, societal well-being and sustainability – is uniquely positioned for such a task.
“A transportation engineer cannot address these questions,” Gao said. “Environmental science cannot address these questions. A health researcher cannot address these questions. However, this transdisciplinary group can do this.”
Pan, Fulton and Gao built an integrated assessment system that included a technical-economic mobility model, a chemical transport model and a health impact assessment tool. Then they projected the vehicle stocks, distance traveled, energy usage and carbon dioxide emissions in the continental U.S. through 2050, and quantified the impacts of changing emissions on concentrations of fine particulate matter in the atmosphere, as well as the ensuing health and economic benefits of populations in 10 major metropolitan areas.
Their simulations show that, depending on how widely the three “revolutions” are adopted, reductions in emissions from passenger travel could prevent between 2,300 and 8,100 premature deaths annually in the U.S. in 2050.
The largest number of prevented deaths coincided with large metropolitan areas, such as Los Angeles and Chicago. At the state level, California, Texas, New York, Ohio and Florida would see the largest decreases in premature mortality.
The associated economic benefits could range from $24 billion to $84 billion annually.
The study hangs on a number of assumptions and uncertainties. After all, driverless cars are not yet commercially available, and sales of electric vehicles lag far behind conventional gas guzzlers.
“Another key finding is that for carbon mitigations and health benefits, vehicle electrification is by far the most important piece, followed by shared mobility (ride-sharing) and then automation, ” Pan said. “The net energy impacts of self-driving vehicles are highly uncertain and automation alone may not dramatically affect energy use, emissions or vehicle-related pollution. ”
A complicating factor is that the efficiency improvement and projected cost reduction from automation could actually lead to increased travel and offset other gains.
“If we automate the vehicles, you might make the transportation system more efficient, but probably more people will travel longer distances,” Gao said. “So there is a balance, there is a trade-off.”
The study concludes that policymakers can help encourage the transition to electric vehicles and boost ride sharing, for example, by issuing tighter fuel economy standards, creating economic incentives for shared mobility and investing in charging infrastructure and technological developments.
A future of autonomous flying taxis
Of course, actually creating such transportation innovations is not possible without first determining their viability.
Another research project from Gao’s lab – published July 6 in Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice – explores the feasibility of an airport shuttle service that uses autonomous flying taxis as a means to mitigate urban congestion. The paper’s lead author is Emily Lewis ’20.
“While you are stuck in traffic from JFK [International Airport] to Manhattan, have you ever thought, oh, I wish I could be a bird, just to fly there. Actually, that dream is not too far away,” said Gao, who directs Cornell’s Center for Transportation, Environment and Community Health. “But how do you even architect a whole system, from the technology to market prediction and to operation? Would such an idea make economic sense at all?”
The study focuses on the concept of urban air mobility – essentially a transportation service for low-altitude airspace in metropolitan areas that features autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles.
Gao’s team – which included co-authors Jesse Ponnock ’20, Qamar Cherqaoui ’20, Scott Holmdahl ’20,Yus Johnson ’20 and Alfred Wong ’20 – focused on the three busiest airports in the U.S.: Atlanta, Los Angeles and Dallas.
They used a holistic, system-architecture analysis to identify each area’s key stakeholders and the goals that meet their needs, such as fleet management, infrastructure, traffic control, safety, user experience, financial viability and performance. The modeling also took into account the relationships between annual profit, mean time between safety incidents, upfront costs and the number of passengers shuttled per day.
“Because of its geographic, meteorological and also demand factors, Los Angeles turns out to be the best case for a pilot city,” Gao said.
The analysis identified wealthy commuters, long-distance commuters, business executives, event attendees, emergency transportation and vacationers as potential early adopters of an air mobility system.
What would such a system actually look like from a passenger’s perspective? It might not be too different from the ride-sharing services of today. The analysis recommended the system use FIFO (first in, first out) queuing and a smartphone interface for passengers, which may sound familiar to anyone who has ever hailed an Uber on their phone.
Also recommended: a hybrid energy source that incorporates electric energy for the autonomous vehicles.
But vehicles and apps are only part of it. For an air mobility system to become a reality, it would need the infrastructure to support it.
“This is not actually as mature as electrification or even automation,” Gao said. “This is even further away down the road. We are not comparing urban air mobility to other modes or arguing this is a better mode. We’re just saying that now, given the interest, first you need to be able to architect this. And then you will have a better sense about cost.”

Electric bikes come with substantial environmental and social benefits, but some marginalized communities are being left out. Here’s why — and what they’re doing about it. 
By Henry Latourette Miller 
This summer has the potential to be the first season of a new era of biking in Portland. It follows a year that saw bike sales skyrocket, the introduction of electric bikes (e-bikes) to Biketown, the expansion of Biketown’s service area to the north and east, and the restriction of car traffic to install sidewalk cafes and improve streets for walkers and rollers.
While these developments are exciting, it is hard to overstate the potential for e-bikes to inject new energy into Portland’s bike culture, which had seen bike commuter rates slide in the years before the pandemic.
By allowing Portlanders to go greater distances with less effort than a normal bike, thanks to an electric motor and battery, e-bikes can bring together the necessary reduction in emissions from cars with America’s love of independent mobility. Unlike scooters, e-bikes are more comfortable when traveling across town and can be powerful enough to carry multiple riders along with groceries and school bags. This power makes it easier for Portlanders to swap what was once a car trip to the store, school or office with a more sustainable mode of transportation, even if they do not have access to good transit options. If enough people make that switch, e-bikes can contribute to making our streets less congested, less polluted, safer and more efficient.
Yet Portland’s embrace of new transportation technologies has often come at the cost of already marginalized community members. This is especially the case for low-income residents and people of color, many of who were pushed out of their neighborhoods to build projects like the Interstate-5 corridor or by the gentrification that followed the construction of TriMet’s MAX Yellow Line.
Jump to years later, and many of the low-income and communities of color in outer Portland neighborhoods that did not experience the same rapid pace of gentrification were also not included in the early service areas of Biketown and e-scooter shares. While the reasons these neighborhoods were excluded from shared mobility in its early years may have been different from the outwardly racist and classist reasoning behind the location of I-5, in many cases the communities left out of the benefits of new technology are the same.
Considering the weight of this history, Portland’s agencies and community leaders have many mountains to climb to ensure e-mobility does not slide into the ravines of injustice created by previous planning decisions.
To see how this can be accomplished, I spoke to five advocates who are working with or within communities that have traditionally been denied the benefits of new transportation technology while shouldering its costs. During our conversations, these advocates revealed four core obstacles to a truly equitable e-bike landscape: price, privacy, payment methods and the built environment.
Price
The first barrier most people encounter when considering e-mobility is the price. At the moment, quality personal-use e-bikes cost at least $1,000, not including the cost of storage and maintenance. This is a lot of money to spend if the initial intention is to use the e-bike as a backup mode of transportation or recreational device.
For those who are interested in e-bikes but cannot afford to drop $1,000 just to try out a new way to get around, shared e-bikes are the best way to test the water without getting too wet.
Yet even though Portland’s bike share, Biketown, lowers the upfront cost to e-bikes for Portlanders, it can still be expensive over time. An annual Biketown membership is $99 plus 10 cents per minute of riding time — a substantial increase over the price of renting the analog Biketown bikes. If you were to bike 40 minutes every workday, the total cost of using your annual Biketown membership today would come to about $1,150.
For someone on a budget who uses their car or TriMet pass not only to get to work, but also to pick up their kids from school or get groceries, switching to Biketown might not make a lot of sense. This is especially true if they have access to free or reduced-price public transit through TriMet’s Low Income Fare Program or the Honored Citizen annual pass, which costs $308 per year.
Cole Lalomia, of the Community Cycling Center, said keeping Biketown’s prices down is critical to making e-biking accessible, as the price, complexity and lack of equipment standardization suggests that affordable personal-use e-bikes could still be years away.
Community Cycling Center is a Northeast Portland-based nonprofit that has been fixing up bikes and teaching kids how to become bike mechanics for two decades. Recently, it has been advocating for better bike infrastructure, including bike parking and greenways in underserved communities, and providing support to community programs and events. Since the start of pandemic, the Community Cycling Center has collaborated with Living Cully on a food pantry delivery program that uses four e-bikes purchased with help from a Portland General Electric grant to deliver food to residents primarily in the Cully neighborhood.
To reduce Biketown’s overall cost for low-income users, Community Cycling Center joined other community-based organizations in 2016 to work with the Portland Bureau of Transportation to create Biketown For All. (Street Roots vendors have been recipients of reduced-priced bike rentals through this program.) Today, Biketown for All allows residents who qualify for state and federal assistance programs such as SNAP food assistance and Oregon Health Plan to pay only $5 per month and five cents per minute, with an additional $20 in free ride credits every month. While this is a jump from the $3-per-month membership Biketown For All provided before the introduction of e-bikes in 2020, riding Biketown’s new bikes 40 minutes every workday can cost as little as $28.50 per month, or $342 a year. Compared to the average annual cost of $8,400 per year to own and maintain a car in Portland, this is a dramatically less expensive way to access a more independent and flexible mobility than transit.
When it comes to Biketown, Lalomia said its new e-bikes “are a gateway into increased e-bike ridership in general.” Lalomia also believes Biketown’s new riders might start saving up to purchase their own e-bikes once they realize “how far they can go, they realize how fast they can go, they realize how little effort they need to put in.”
Privacy and payment methods
Unfortunately, shared mobility providers like Biketown introduce new technological challenges that are trickier to address than prices. Most e-mobility devices are activated with a smartphone and paid for through an online bank account, which local community development corporation Hacienda CDC and digital justice nonprofit Suma have identified as significant barriers to the communities they serve.
While electronic payments can cut down substantially on the hassle of e-mobility and other essential services for many, not every Portlander has a smartphone or bank account. Despite Biketown For All and a few private shared mobility companies allowing riders to pay for memberships using cash or a prepaid debit card, those riders typically have to travel downtown to make this transaction.
Suma Executive Director Alan Hipólito pointed out that this extra step is a reflection of how frontline communities, who could benefit just as much or more from better mobility options and reduced emissions, have not been given the opportunity to shape shared mobility. “Many of these systems are set up to be technologically seamless,” said Hipólito. “And when you try to go outside of that, it’s by definition a workaround.”
Hacienda CDC’s Jessica Lam has also found that just because someone has a smartphone and bank account, it does not mean they feel comfortable using the Biketown app or sharing their personal information online. “A lot of our families rely on younger kids, the high school kids, to help navigate all of that,” said Lam, who praised a Suma workshop that taught a small group of Hacienda’s community members how to navigate the internet safely. The workshop included lessons on inputting personal information safely and avoiding phishing scams.
Suma is working to address the above challenges through community organizing, training and informational sessions, and by creating its own community-based digital platform (the “secret sauce” of which Hipólito kept under wraps).
“One of the challenges of technology is that there are not many technology companies that are started specifically with an eye to address poverty or justice. So companies don’t come to neighborhoods like Cully to build platforms to co-create them with people who live there. That’s what we are trying to do,” said Hipólito. “We think there’s an opportunity at the community level to build a different kind of platform that is specifically built to serve these kinds of communities, that is specifically built to overcome cost, privacy and banking.”
The built environment
For decades, most of Portland’s streets were designed and redesigned for the benefit of the automobile, usually at the cost of safety for pedestrians and cyclists. Even as the Portland Bureau of Transportation continues to install better bike and pedestrian infrastructure on Northeast Portland streets such as Killingsworth Street and Cully Boulevard, many frontline communities live in areas with a higher density of PBOT-identified High Crash Network streets and intersections.
In the 2000s, Hacienda CDC created Verde, a nonprofit that serves low-income residents of Cully by “building environmental wealth” for the community. While Cully saw more of its streets included in Biketown’s 2020 service area expansion, Verde’s director of strategic partnerships, Vivian Satterfield, believes that substantial infrastructure investments are needed in Cully before we can expect residents to feel safe using e-bikes to get around. “While some may feel confident taking a bicycle or another mobility device on a gravel road, a majority of folks don’t find that confidence easily,” said Satterfield, referring to the concentration of unpaved streets in Cully.
While Satterfield sees the merit of shared mobility provided by private companies, she stressed that the priority in Cully should be affordable, accessible and frequent mass transit, “because then we have all the public investments that support a mass transit system. Stuff like sidewalks and paved streets and lower speed limits in thoroughfares, and transportation infrastructure like shelter and lighting. That’s public infrastructure, and I don’t believe that private enterprises are ever going to deliver all of those corollary needs.”
Despite the inhospitable environment for cyclists in Portland’s outer neighborhoods, the Rosewood Initiative’s Jossie de la Garza has noticed more people in the neighborhood taking interest in recreational biking since the pandemic began.
The area de la Garza’s organization serves is still beyond Biketown’s service area, but she has noticed the bike repair shop next to the organization’s headquarters on Southeast 162nd Avenue and Stark Street staying busy throughout the past year. “COVID has definitely made it apparent how much outdoor space does matter, especially in the Rosewood neighborhood, where you have a lot of apartment complexes, but not enough green space,” de la Garza said.
Yet this enthusiasm for bikes as a form of recreation also hints at why some residents might never use their bikes for anything more. It’s not just the high traffic and car speeds that punish cyclists in the outer east-side neighborhoods. A history of poor transit access and a lack of nearby job centers and services mean that if you decide to bike for utility, you likely face a long ride.
De la Garza said larger families would struggle to rely on regular bikes for non-recreational trips, as the distances and errands — from groceries to visiting the doctor to picking up kids from school — would be too unwieldy. De la Garza believes e-bikes might address these practical problems to some degree.
While adding new bike infrastructure would make it safer to bike in the neighborhood, de la Garza thinks there are community members who would be concerned that it might result in gentrification of a neighborhood that is 30% Latino. “That’s something we always have in the back of our mind, and I think that’s why it’s much more important to have the community involved” with any new bike infrastructure projects in the neighborhood.
Both Lam and de la Garza said they expect their organizations to work with PBOT this summer to discuss improving bike infrastructure and Biketown access for their communities. In the meantime, de la Garza expects to see even more residents take up biking around the neighborhood.
Hope for the future
Despite the challenges, Hipólito believes there is an opportunity for shared e-mobility to be different than previous innovations in transportation.
Many private shared mobility providers are new companies in a political environment where it is getting harder to ignore the negative consequences their services might have on frontline communities. Some e-mobility providers “are seeing a real opportunity to serve frontline communities,” Hipólito said.
As e-mobility is still a young industry, Hipólito believes these companies have the flexibility to decide, “Well, just because we did something this way over here doesn’t mean we can’t try something different in Cully, or in this other community in Portland, if it means we have a chance to respond to what the community wants us to do.”

Autonomous vehicle technologies have been around for years. You can see some of them in machinery such as agriculture and paving equipment, as well as automobiles such as passenger vehicles and even heavy-duty trucks.
Back in 2016, a project known as the Colorado beer run showcased the possibilities of vehicle autonomy in the trucking industry. A human drove a tractor-trailer loaded with Budweiser beer onto I-25. The driver then put the truck into self-driving mode before retiring to the sleeper. That truck operated autonomously for roughly 3 hours and 130 miles, right down to the braking and turn signaling.
“Just from looking at this project, we know these types of technologies are already close to prime time,” said Dan Murray, senior vice president of the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI), keynote speaker at AEM’s recently held member education webinar on autonomous vehicles.
Widespread adoption is of course the ultimate goal, but companies need to prepare for the investments that are needed in their organizations and in our infrastructure.
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO ROI
ATRI has done extensive research in the area of autonomous vehicle technology adoption. Motor carriers and drivers share many of the same desires and concerns. At the top of the list are upfront investment and insurance premiums.
“Autonomous equipment has a high upfront cost,” Murray said. “It’s typical to spend $130,000 for a tractor today. But a tractor with autonomous technologies will easily cost $185,000 to $200,000. This means that, ultimately, the cost to transport goods is going to be higher. If a motor carrier can’t pass that cost onto its customer, what real benefit is in it for them?”
Something similar can be said about insurance premiums. According to Murray, an investment in autonomous technologies that make vehicles safer does not translate to reduced premiums. So again, the motor carrier or driver (owner/operator) sees no immediate financial benefit to making that investment.
“Additionally, trial lawyers are drooling over this environment,” Murray added. U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) data shows that roughly 89% of critical crash factors are associated with human factors. The remaining 11% are vehicle and component-related faults.
“With autonomous vehicles, it will probably be a flipflop,” Murray suggested. “You’ll likely see changes in the model of litigation, but litigation itself is not going away. There are some opportunities to improve safety with autonomous technologies, but do not assume litigation will go the way of the dinosaur.”
Another financial factor standing in the way of adoption is the fact that there will still be driver costs. The days of fully autonomous, driverless vehicles are far down the road. Plus, drivers still have a long list of inspection and reporting tasks that must be completed on a routine basis.
One other financial deterrent is the fact that no tax credits exist for autonomous technology investment — at least not yet.
“The good news is that the U.S. DOT may be contemplating tax credits for implementing some of these technologies,” Murray pointed out. “It’s hard to tell if Congress would ultimately end up authorizing such credits. But the fact that this is even being considered is a positive indication.”
6 MORE KEYS TO AUTONOMOUS ADOPTION
Driver acceptance is an adoption prerequisite identified by both motor carriers and drivers. In order to move toward widescale adoption, drivers must want them on the trucks, vans and other vehicles they are employed to operate. One in-road is that autonomous technology helps attract a new pool of potential drivers to the profession. As Murray noted, these high-tech cabs could appeal to younger, more tech-savvy individuals. That could go a long way toward helping solve the driver shortage issue that has been plaguing several industries.Weather can be a challenge for autonomous systems, especially when driving in the northern states where snow and ice can impede radar, lidar and camera systems. Rain and fog can have a crippling effect, too. “These systems will not be able to be used in northern environments for another 3 to 5 years, if not 10,” Murray speculated.Construction zones. Today’s popular autonomous technologies like radar and lidar can also be negatively impacted by construction zones. The larger the project and longer the duration, the bigger the impact.Inadequate infrastructure. Speaking of road construction projects, infrastructure in general is another challenge. Roadway defects like potholes and faded lane striping make it difficult to impossible for autonomous vehicles to operate.Traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is not friendly toward an autonomous vehicle. “Drivers don’t want all of those advanced warning systems going off nonstop as traffic congestion builds on both sides of the vehicle,” Murray said. “Most of these autonomous systems will be best used out on the open road, away from all of this urban congestion.” As e-commerce has exploded over the past year, a new opportunity for autonomy has emerged. More delivery fleets are venturing into suburban and rural areas. These represent the ideal applications for autonomous technologies to be deployed. This could help accelerate adoption.Murray said the federal government isn’t doing enough to advance the concept of autonomous delivery vehicles. Murray would like to see programs and regulations become standardized on a federal level so autonomous vehicles can better operate across state lines. “If you’re platooning in Minnesota, for instance, you’re allowed to have an 80-foot headway between the vehicles,” Murray explained. “When you get to Wisconsin, it drops to 40 feet. Once in Illinois, it goes back up to 65 feet. The poor driver can’t be pulling over at every state line to change the calibration of the vehicle’s sensors. If we don’t have a seamless interstate system, we won’t have a safe, efficient and productive autonomous transportation system.”
OFF-ROAD AUTONOMOUS APPLICATIONS
While challenges may stand in the way of widespread adoption of autonomous vehicle technologies, they have been making their mark in off-road applications for several years now.
The first autonomous testing began in Japan in 1990. However, the process actually began with the release of the Field Management Software (FMS) for mines in the late 1980s, and it drove the subsequent development of Komatsu’s autonomous platform.
The inaugural commercial deployment took place in Chile in 2007, and a second system was launched a year later at a Western Australia-based iron ore mining operation. Finally, in 2013, Komatsu introduced the world’s first dozer with fully automatic blade control.
The lessons learned from those efforts eventually led to the first North American deployment in 2016. By 2018, Komatsu had moved over 2 billion tons, with 130 fully autonomous mining trucks running across seven operational sites (six of which are fully autonomous sites). As of June 2020, the numbers jumped to to 3 billion tons moved by 251 trucks, and the fleet still maintained a perfect safety record with no incidents as of that time.
Caterpillar has also embraced autonomous vehicle technologies. The company had 276 autonomous trucks in operation have driven over 42 million miles without a lost-time injury, as of late 2020. In addition, Caterpillar has doubled the amount it has hauled autonomously since reaching the 1 billion-ton mark in November of 2018.
As of late 2020, autonomous vehicles held a market share of less than 1% of total construction equipment sales worldwide. However, given global equipment sales are projected to grow 2.5% each year until 2022, coupled with the exponential growth in adoption of AVs, the market share is expected to double in size in the next couple of years.
Autonomous heavy haulers are already in use in mining in several countries, with automated agricultural and forestry equipment currently being developed as well. While a combination of GPS and other location tracking sensors, image sensors and telematics assist John Deere vehicles to navigate fields today, the company still can’t truly replicate everything a human would see and feel sitting in the tractor cab. The determining factors here are farmer perception and added value. This will remain the case until more tasks, and not just movement, become automated.
Meanwhile, the forestry sector has seen limited progress with automation, largely due to working conditions being over considerably larger areas than those experienced by the other sectors. Work sites are often in remote areas, on steep slopes, and in very rugged and variable terrain. In these remote areas, there are generally no cell towers and no Wi-Fi, and communication is currently expensive with limited bandwidth. The next generation of very large fleets of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, however, is expected to address this problem.
In addition, construction contractors are applying self-driving machinery to do repetitive tasks, such as pouring concrete, bricklaying, welding and even demolition. Excavation and other prep work is also being completed by autonomous or semi-autonomous bulldozers, which can ready a jobsite with the help of a human programmer to exact specifications.
TECHNOLOGIES BEING ADOPTED
Differential GPS represents one of the more promising autonomous technologies today, according to Murray. Consider the fact that GPS on the typical smartphone is fairly accurate with a resolution of roughly 10 feet. “You can’t see what lane you’re in, but you can certainly see what road you’re on,” Murray said. “With differential GPS, a correction signal gets you down to just a couple of centimeters. If you add that to an autonomous system, you suddenly have an all-weather fighter, which is really important in northern states.”
Murray is especially excited about camera monitoring systems. “The U.S. DOT has exempted side-view mirrors on trucks and large vehicles if you have video mirrors,” Murray said. “Not only does that technology give drivers a wider field of view and improved safety, but a vehicle can also get 1-2% fuel economy benefit by removing the big, obsolete side-view mirrors.”
As Murray noted, most tractor-trailers in operation today do not employ ADAS technologies, but the list is as follows (Below percentages are approximate.)
Adaptive steering control – 92%Camera-based mirror system – 90%Active lane centering assist – 90%Active lane keep assist – 85%Driver-facing camera – 82%Blind spot warning – 80%Auto emergency braking – 70%Lane departure warning – 70%Forward collision warning – 62%Adaptive cruise control – 62%
ATRI recently completed an extensive study where motor carriers and drivers were asked which technologies they wanted to consider adopting. Automated emergency braking topped the list at 16%, followed closely by forward collision warning and road-facing cameras at 14%. Lane detection warning was cited by roughly 10% of those surveyed.
There is an important distinction to be made regarding motor carrier attitudes vs. driver attitudes.
“While the motor carriers are pretty excited about many of these systems, that’s not so much the case with the drivers,” Murray pointed out. Many tractor-trailer drivers are in their mid-40s or older. This demographic tends to be extra cautious where technology is concerned. Some are even downright cynical.
“There is a lot of education, promotion and awareness that needs to happen in order to convince drivers that these technologies are not going to put them out of a job,” Murray said. “These technologies are just going to make the driver experience easier, better and safer.”
Both drivers and motor carriers also need a little convincing where investment and ROI are concerned. If some of those hurdles could be cleared, autonomous adoption could accelerate in coming years.

 In this special guest feature, Gilad Avrashi, CTO & Co-Founder at MDgo, believes that now is the time for the insurance industry to leverage AI technology to unlock the power of data and provide personalized services that customers demand to retain them as loyal customers. 

Data is transforming the way we live and how consumers engage with service providers. Most industries are using data to personalize offerings for customers and provide real-time expertise to strengthen relationships while gaining consumer trust. We are seeing this with Netflix making personalized movie recommendations based on the viewer’s specific interests and history. Now is the time for the insurance industry to leverage AI technology to unlock the power of data and provide personalized services that customers demand to retain them as loyal customers.
In addition to leveraging data for personalized services, insurance providers must compete on price to retain today’s customers. AI technology gives insurers the data needed to streamline the claims process, while reducing costs to pass savings off to customers. Leveraging data from advanced technologies to better understand drivers and accidents drives customer retention, brand loyalty and savings.
Despite the obvious benefits of leveraging data, very few insurers currently do it, creating gaps between their capabilities and customers’ immediate needs and expectations. For instance, according to the OECD, 44% of car crash fatalities could have been prevented if real-time data on the type and severity of their injuries were available for emergency medical services and treating hospitals. Indeed, AI technology has the power to uncover real-time insights from car accidents including occupants’ injuries and vehicle damage, providing lifesaving information to medical teams.
Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, ADR technology (Accident Detection and Response) can analyze the crash pulse recorded by vehicle telematics devices and virtual sensors to provide detailed reports. Beyond life-saving capabilities, AI can provide personalized services to drivers, such as automatically recommending a tow truck or autobody shop after an accident, as well as other location-based associated services.
ADR, powered by AI technology and machine learning capabilities, has huge potential for data applications in the insurance industry, and here’s a bit about how it works, beginning from the moment a crash occurs.
Gain access crash and injury data powered by machine learning
ADR’s initial, and potentially most significant, application of AI is to extrapolate crash test data to better understand and predict the connection between vehicle acceleration (or deceleration) and potential injuries. Advanced machine learning algorithms are used in tandem with physical sensor devices installed in the vehicle to accurately detect crashes as they happen. In order to address one of the most significant pain points of insurers, i.e. accurate and real time first notice of loss, which is driven by a low false negative and false positive rate. 
The physical sensor “wakes up” when it senses a shift in the vehicle’s acceleration, guaranteeing that no event goes undetected and lowering the false negative rate. Then, machine learning algorithms gain a complete picture of the crash, which makes it possible to remove the possibility of false positives. Finally, once a crash is detected, the damage and injury insights are provided using deep learning models, making it possible to deliver insurers detailed crash reports in real-time.
How is this done, you might ask? That’s where the concept of ADR’s unique virtual sensors come into the picture. Using cutting-edge deep learning networks, vehicle motion sensor readings are translated into virtual sensors, or a grid of dozens of sensors that are usually set up to determine potential vehicle damages and occupant injuries in crash test scenarios, such as those conducted by automotive OEMs.
 These sensors are virtually placed in and around the vehicle and its occupants, thereby emulating a world where you potentially walk around with an accelerometer inside of your head to assess potential injuries, without ever having to install any additional hardware. This imaginary “hardware” or virtual sensors makes it possible to determine where an occupant involved in a crash has been injured – delivering this information both to their insurer and, more importantly, to first responders and medical personnel.
Finally, each crash is identified by a unique crash pulse, which is used as its fingerprint. Machine learning algorithms analyze the fingerprint and construct a full crash profile, which is then translated into accurate damage and injury insights, providing an objective view of the accident. Access to these detailed data could decrease costs for insurance providers as gain access to a complete picture of a crash and its immediate consequences for the occupants.
Making the delivery of personalized services and care for policyholders possible
Beyond lifesaving capabilities, AI can automatically assist drivers in the recovery process following an accident. Having crash data readily available allows insurers to automatically make recommendations for recovery. Imagine receiving a message from your provider immediately after a wreck letting you know a tow truck is on the way and directing you to the nearest autobody shop. These types of personalized automated engagements are possible with robust data collection and processing beginning at the moment of impact.  
An objective view of accident data is a critical and hitherto limited area of visibility for the auto insurance industry. ADR removes uncertainties by detailing the accident journey in data-driven reports for the insurer. Personalizing recommendations based on data could save insurers money during the claims process as they guide customers to supported garages and gain a clear picture of the accident the moment it occurs, which also delivers personalization value.
In all, AI has immense potential to transform the insurance industry as we know it. We’re about to witness a true top-down shift, be it from offering tailored, personalized services that begin at the moment of impact, to reducing claim costs for insurers by directing policyholders to engage with an affiliated network of services (i.e. DRP body shops and tow trucks). These capabilities and more are made possible with ADR’s real-time sensor data and custom-built AI algorithms, delivering fully objective reports with zero human intervention that help insurers deliver unique life and cost-saving value for policyholders.

AI-driven capabilities have catapulted route planning optimization technology forward. While AI will drive the future of trucking, it’s also driving the present with optimization technology.
The global pandemic has paused or inhibited momentum for a number of industries, but not the trucking industry.
The economy relies heavily on drivers and fleets. Although it faces various obstacles — including increased demand and fewer drivers to meet it – the trucking industry continues to see significant growth.
According to the American Trucking Association, the trucking industry was short roughly 60,800 drivers back in 2018, and the shortage has continued. Experts estimate 80,000 fewer available drivers on the roads in 2021 vs. a year ago. A combined higher demand and lack of qualified drivers requires fleets to accelerate their digital transformation efforts to keep pace.
More fleets than ever before are leveraging cloud-based software and data to decrease planning time and optimize workflows. Fleet management software platforms enable fleets to do more with less and increase driver efficiency, which helps drivers complete more stops and thrive in a supportive work environment.
What specific capabilities have fleets invested in to rise above the competition, improve decision-making and meet demand?
Route optimization technologyAI-driven capabilities have catapulted route planning optimization technology forward. While AI will drive the future of trucking, it’s also driving the present with optimization technology. 
This technology automates driver plans to set both fleets and drivers up for success. By taking data and constantly-changing variables like weather and construction into account, planners can assign drivers to routes that save time and reduce missed deliveries. AI has raised the industry standard for efficient route planning, and trucking has recognized the value of automated route optimization technology. Automation capabilities will continue to evolve and advance transportation management processes.
Drivers, as well as fleets, benefit from route optimization. AI-based software will increasingly enhance the driver experience by more effectively utilizing their skillsets.
Eventually, route optimization software will start taking additional driver variables into account, such as their experience levels and preferences. For instance, fleets could create smoother, more efficient dispatching and driver training processes by automatically assigning new drivers to easier routes.
Driver workflow softwareThe buzz around “workflow” is well-deserved these days. Drivers can use trip and location-enabled apps to access the digital forms they need for each stop and customer, saving time by reducing paperwork and bypassing unnecessary steps that, in the past, had caused manual-based errors.
Driver workflow solutions increase fleet flexibility.
With more advanced driver workflow software, each trucking company can customize their workflow steps and forms for drivers to suit their specific needs. These flexible forms and workflows improve the overall driver experience, which could lead to increased driver retention in the midst of a serious shortage. These solutions also boost productivity for all users: managers, dispatchers, planners, and drivers alike.
Driver workflow solutions also streamline communication.
Managers and drivers who use workflow software can communicate more easily via real-time data visibility, constant ETA updates and in-app messaging tools. Enhanced communication ensures operational efficiency and data integrity – critical for fleet managers and planners.
Driver workflow solutions streamline onboarding.
With fleets trying to meet constant demand, they’re always seeking ways to streamline the driver hiring and training process. Driver workflow technology eliminates those tedious, lengthy processes by reducing training time. A more intuitive dashboard means that drivers spend less time learning how to use and become comfortable with the software. Fleets benefit by saving money, time, and resources.
Trucking industry will benefit from embracing digital transformationManagers and executives working to meet demand, increase efficiency and hire, train, and retain drivers need reliable fleet optimization solutions. In the midst of a pandemic and driver shortage, fleets that utilize route and workflow optimization technology can accomplish more with less. These digital transformation efforts use data and AI to improve decision-making and enable fleets to rise above the competition.
The future of transportation management has arrived; those who choose to ignore the technology will find themselves left far behind.

Technologies that give fleets a unified view of driver safety data can assist with proactive safety training.
Fact No. 1: Vast amounts of data are available to trucking companies. Besides getting real-time data from telematics, ELDs, dashboard cams and transportation management software (TMS) components, companies gather data from insurance providers and public databases that include motor vehicle records, VIN records and federal safety collections.
Fact No. 2: The transportation industry is placing an ever-stronger emphasis on safety. Companies are prioritizing investments that can improve driver training, avert nuclear verdicts, mitigate risks and manage insurance premiums.
Let’s bring these two facts together by suggesting ways that data can and should be used to address safety concerns.
Ideally, one platform could pull data from disparate sources and compile it into an easy-to-use mechanism like a driver scorecard. Otherwise, management teams are inefficiently stitching together data points and working with inconsistent formats and outputs, all of which makes forming predictions and correlations much harder to do.
Assuming you have a system like this in place or are moving toward it, let’s take a look at how unified data can help make you safer. The key is to leverage and analyze the data to pinpoint potential risks, and then respond to those risks with concrete actions to reduce the risk levels.
Preventive driver trainingData can be applied before and after accidents happen to provide extra training for the most at-risk drivers.
Post-accident training would obviously be based on whatever incident has occurred. The sooner the training happens after the accident, the better. Reinforcement or remediation of certain material can help prevent the inciting behavior and thus reduce future accidents. It can also be offered to insurers as good faith proof of efforts to mitigate future risk.
Proper review and follow-up are essential to make sure the offending behavior is being controlled by the driver. Compliant drivers – ones who observe the rules, and correct behaviors when they do start to develop bad habits – are safer drivers. Studies show that post-accident training reduces the driver behavior in question by up to 80% over the following year and a half.
Pre-accident training can be applied towards any area that your predictive data is indicating. It could drop incident rates by much as 30%. Examining the data will expose training opportunities up and down your organization.
For instance, is a driver lately recording more incidents of hard braking? Or is excessive speed up across the entire fleet? These data points will help you target your communications and training. Again, the process is much more manageable if you have a system in place to handle such workflows by identifying behaviors at a certain threshold, matching them with appropriate training modules, alerts and follow-ups.
You may also link accident prevention intelligence to specific routes. Data can tell you everything from what time of day a particular road is the safest or what section of a route experiences higher accident rates. The data can get surprisingly granular. Drivers can be notified accordingly, whether that is done manually through a dispatcher or via an automated workflow.
The results make these efforts well worth your time and energy. Better training creates more prepared drivers, which results in fewer accidents, less chance of nuclear verdicts, reduced risk and improved relations with insurers that hopefully will produce lower or more stable premiums.
Beefing up complianceNow that we’ve demonstrated how data can energize your safety program, let’s go a step further. A unified system and united data can aid in virtually every goal of your business, starting with compliance.
Let’s say the DOT pays a visit to you in Kansas City to perform an audit. However, your filing cabinets containing compliance paperwork are all in Dallas. While this sort of scenario is on the decline, it does exist.
Even if you’ve gone all digital with files, what happens if you have 50 locations nationwide and each location is a ‘silo’ that keeps its information separate and unintegrated? You will have problems with gathering, collating and presenting all of the data.
The right system will funnel all the relevant data into one vantage point and present it in an easily digestible format. Putting a system like this in place will help streamline and improve everything from troubleshooting in-the-minute operational issues to determining long-term strategy.
Fleet executives need to see how the data from all locations fits together to get a cohesive, overall view of the business. A real-time, bird’s-eye view of the corporate situation is an efficient vehicle for achieving control and visibility into all aspects of the organization.
Your data is what you make of it. A thoughtful and thorough approach to data management, usage and analysis ensures it will point the way forward to success in each area of your business.

By 2030, the world will see 41 million 5G-connected cars on the smart city roads. The prediction comes from the 5G in automotive and smart transportation application analysis report. This number will rise to a whopping 83 million by 2035. A three-quarter of these 5G-connected cars will be cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) equipped cars.
As per research, the 5G C-V2X cars will enhance road safety and improve the traffic ecosystem. Simultaneously, it will also reduce the use of fossil fuels by up to one-third. What’s more important?
The technology of sharing sensor data in these cars will focus on the protection of the vulnerable road users. These include pedestrians and cyclists. With 5G-based cellular connectivity in cars, experts also foresee the possibility of achieving the ‘vision of zero road traffic deaths.
But how exactly do these cars operate? Let us take a brief look. 
The Mechanism Of 5G-Enabled C-V2X Cars 
Cellular V2X is a global system of vehicle-to-everything communication. Its design intends to improve road safety and promote smart transportation such as automated driving. The concept is developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Organisation. 
The C-V2X uses 3GPP standardised 4G LTE or 5G mobile cellular connectivity. This helps it to send and receive signals from a vehicle to other vehicles, people and objects. In other words, it connects to other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and other fixed objects such as traffic lights in its vicinity. It works without network assistance and has a range of more than a mile.Advertisement
So, C-V2X establishes communication with moving objects on the road and the roadside infrastructure. This helps C-V2X-enabled cars to keep the focus on decreasing the number of fatal road accidents. And as this technology advances, it is anticipated to have expanded safety features.
Thanks to technology, it is gaining significant attention from almost every mobile operator and automobile industry giants. Some of the big names like Audi, BMW, Tesla and Toyota are teaming up to implement C-V2X trials for commercial deployment.
Potential Of 5G Technology In The Automated Vehicle Industry
Audi and Ericsson entered a partnership in 2018 with the aim to work on a series of 5G connected car initiatives. One of their first projects is a 5G-enabled automation application that focuses on personal safety.
Both Audi and Ericsson have been testing the use of 5G wireless network technology for the production of vehicles. Their partnership is showcasing the potential of wireless communication in production at an early stage. 
5G networks offer ultra-low latency which will act as the driving force that enables connected cars to progress exponentially. As per Marie Hogan, head of mobile broadband & IoT at Ericsson, 5G satisfies the performance requirements of industrial automation. 
Further, Hogan says that 5G combines all points in their production environment leading to enormous improvements in flexibility and connectivity. As a result, it “shows how humans and robots can work together safely.”
Therefore, this is the first time that highly advanced applications and system-critical IoT networking come together to offer greater flexibility, mobility and efficiency. This in terms of production automation.
Currently, the team is testing the potential of 5G technology for industrial application in the Audi Production Lab. These kinds of projects are intended to understand more about how wireless networks can be used optimally in a smart factory.  The statement comes from Dr Henning Löser, head of the Audi Production Lab.
The First Car To Hit The Roads Of China
Recently, China Telecom has announced the first production car in the world enabled with 5G technology. The car is named ‘HiPhi 1’ by HiPhi, a subsidiary brand of Human Horizons. The company is a part of the intelligent company’s “3 Smart” strategic blueprint. This includes smart vehicles, smart transportation and smart cities. 
The aim of Human Horizons is to develop smart transportation technologies that transform the meaning of human mobility. And this is to contribute to the advancement of smart cities. In partnership with China Telecom, the company will work on 5G technology research and implementation. The focus will be in the areas of the “3 Smart” strategic blueprint. 
Coming to HiPhi, the car will have the world’s first human-oriented architecture (HOA). The HOA is self-adaptive and learns to create diversified solutions to enhance user experience. 
It consists of a ‘neural network’ of four ‘super brain’ domain controllers and six microprocessing units (MPUS) connected by 1G Ethernet. The connectivity provides a higher communication rate than conventional area networks.
The car is capable of analysing massive amounts of data and making decisions. This is as per the claims of the partnership. To do so, the car will make use of cloud computing with a powerful data analysis engine. Altogether, this will give birth to a truly intelligent and smart vehicle. 
The HiPhi 1 will run on electricity with a 5G-V2X enabled communication network. It will feature more than five hundred sensors possessing the excellent capability to connect between cars, roads and cities.
As per reports, the automaker’s partnership with China Telecom is one-of-its-kind. This collaboration will help expedite the commercialisation of 5G in the automated vehicles industry. The commercial rollout of HiPhi 1 is expected from the beginning of 2021. 
The Roll Out Of HiCar 
Huawei’s 5G-based C-V2X HiCar technology is grabbing the attention of many automakers. The technology offers an interface to the car’s core operating system. Alongside, it also aids in connecting a car to everything – from moving to non-moving objects on the road.
It has the capability to connect to traffic lights, cameras and speed limit signals. 30 different auto brands will be using HiCar technology for the arriving models. Huawei has already signed up 18 automakers such as Audi and Toyota to use the technology.
However, the first one to showcase HiCar’s potential on the road will be BYD, China’s largest EV maker. BYD will be using HiCar in its upgraded Han flagship electric sedan. It’s car ‘Han EV’ will make its first appearance in June 2020.
The car will have a slight resemblance to Tesla Model 3 in China in terms of style and initial price (about $40,000). With the use of the latest lithium iron phosphate batteries in multiple pack sizes, the Han EV will traverse up to 375 miles. It reaches a speed of 60 mph in less than 4 seconds.
Among Chinese battery makers, BYD stands in second place with 10.76 GWh capacity, after battery giant CATL. As the company claims, its blade-shaped design enhances space utilisation by over 50% than other pack layouts. And the design is safer than other competitors. 
Why Will 5G Cars First Appear On Chinese Roads?
China has already completed deployment of almost 200,000 5G base stations across the nation. By the end of 2020, the country will have 500,000 5G base stations deployed. The report is as per the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China. 
The number of 5G base stations is increasing in China. Evidently, China is on the way to becoming the first country to have C-V2X deployed. The rapidly increasing installation of 5G networks will play a huge role in expanding the C-V2X market size.
Not just in China, but other parts of the world as well. We may see it by the first quarter of 2021.

If you think real estate is thrice obsessed with location (and it is), make room for geodata’s expanding role in payments, banking and a slew of related activities. The January 2021 Digital Consumer Onboarding Tracker® done in collaboration with Melissa informs on issues of the moment around how location data is making financial transactions safer and more accurate.
Saying location “is crucial to merchants, banks and service providers looking to reach customers in the digital age,” the Tracker adds that “maintaining accurate address information starts with onboarding and ends with ensuring that businesses have the most up-to-date information to tailor the final steps of delivery to their customers. Faulty data, on the other hand, can result in botched deliveries, inefficient operations and poor communication with customers.”
Faulty data. Sounds bad, but “terrible” may better describe it. “Failing to obtain accurate data and frustrating customers naturally leads to diminished sales. One study reported that 19 percent of failed deliveries are the result of erroneous address information. Such errors can cost companies hundreds of thousands of dollars annually, and large retailers report that annual charges can run into the millions if carriers must fix addresses to complete deliveries.”
Stakes are clearly high in the location accuracy game. The January 2021 Digital Consumer Onboarding Tracker® provides a focused view of how companies are getting it right.
Wherever You Go, There You Are
Geocoding relies on exact geophysical coordinates for a given address or location. Companies are using it more for logistical planning to fine-tune nettlesome “last mile” delivery snags for better customer experiences. Given the new prevalence of remote onboarding, collecting accurate address data is the point at which errors can begin, or be avoided entirely.
“Recent strides have been made in the use of geocoding technology, particularly in the financial and retail space. The precision and accuracy geocoding provides can open doors to even deeper insight when it comes to [firms’] customer data,” Bud Walker, chief strategy officer at Melissa, told PYMNTS.
Walker added, “Geocoding is useful for analytics: By plotting points on a map, businesses can identify segmentation patterns to more effectively target their customers. In addition, rooftop-level geocoding provides delivery-point accuracy. Giving retailers the ability to ‘put the pin’ in the customer’s driveway improves logistics and cuts down on shipping costs. Geocoding is also useful in risk assessment and fraud prevention. By developing purchasing behavior patterns, financial institutions can mitigate fraud by identifying unusual activity in a location that’s not typical of a specific customer.”
Address Verification Completes The Picture
Geocoding converts addresses to map points plus directions — indispensable in the delivery economy that’s grown exponentially since the pandemic hit. In new Tracker, Sunil Sharma, chief product and technology officer for Los Angeles-based online logistics marketplace Cargomatic, told PYMNTS, “Geocoding is a critical part of the plumbing, and final mile delivery would be incredibly hard to handle without it. Today’s shopper expects to know where their order is for every step of the shipment’s journey and expects proactive communication for any deviation.”
This comes in many forms, Sharma said, but location data has very precise applications.  “Optimizing routes with geocoding can stop a delivery from being missed or delayed by sending an 18-wheeler into a small neighborhood, for example. The technology is expected not only to improve the economics for all parties but also to reduce delivery networks’ carbon footprints.”
Precision, then, becomes the merchant’s friend and ally. And precision is badly needed.
As Melissa’s Bud Walker told PYMNTS, “Since address databases are often full of errors, it can be challenging to match this data with actual coordinates. That’s why it’s important to work with an address verification expert as part of [a firm’s] geocoding initiatives to properly parse, correct and verify the physical address data. Once [firms] have that foundation of complete and accurate data, valuable demographics such as household income, credit information and more can be added, giving [firms] the insight [needed] for customer profiling.”

Flying cars are almost a byword for the misplaced optimism of technologists, but recent news suggests their future may be on slightly firmer footing. The industry has seen a major influx of capital and big automakers seem to be piling in.
What actually constitutes a flying car has changed many times over the decades since the cartoon, The Jetsons, introduced the idea to the popular imagination. Today’s incarnation is known more formally as an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.
As the name suggests, the vehicles run on battery power rather than aviation fuel, and they’re able to take off and land like a helicopter. Designs vary from what are essentially gigantic multi-rotor drones to small fixed-wing aircraft with rotors that can tilt up or down, allowing them to hover or fly horizontally (like an airplane).
Aerospace companies and startups have been working on the idea for a number of years, but recent news suggests it might be coming closer to fruition. Last Monday, major automakers Hyundai and GM said they are developing vehicles of their own and are bullish about the prospects of this new mode of transport.
And the week prior, British flying car maker Vertical Aerospace announced plans to go public in a deal that values the company at $2.2 billion. Vertical Aerospace also said it had received $4 billion worth of preorders, including from American Airlines and Virgin Atlantic.
The deal was the latest installment in a flood of capital into the sector, with competitors Joby Aviation, Archer Aviation, and Lilium all recently announcing deals to go public too. Also joining them is Blade Urban Mobility, which currently operates heliports but plans to accommodate flying cars when they become available.
When exactly that will be is still uncertain, but there seems to be growing consensus that the second half of this decade might be a realistic prospect. Vertical is aiming to start deliveries by 2024. And the other startups, who already have impressive prototypes, are on a similar timeline.
Hyundai’s global chief operating officer, José Muñoz, told attendees at Reuters’ Car of the Future conference that the company is targeting a 2025 rollout of an air taxi service, while GM’s vice president of global innovation, Pamela Fletcher, went with a more cautious 2030 target. They’re not the only automakers getting in on the act, with Toyota, Daimler, and China’s Geely all developing vehicles alone or in partnership with startups.
Regulators also seem to be increasingly open to the idea.
In January, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced it expects to certify the first eVTOLs later this year and have regulations around their operation in place by 2023. And last month the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said it expected air taxi services to be running by 2024 or 2025.
While it seems fairly settled that the earliest flying cars will be taxis rather than private vehicles, a major outstanding question is the extent to which they will be automated.
The majority of prototypes currently rely on a human to pilot them. But earlier this month Larry Page’s air taxi startup Kitty Hawk announced it would buy drone maker 3D Robotics as it seeks to shift to a fully autonomous setup. The FAA recently created a new committee to draft a regulatory path for beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) autonomous drone flights. This would likely be a first step along the path to allowing unmanned passenger aircraft.
What seems more certain is that there will be winners and losers in the recent rush to corner the air mobility market. As Chris Bryant points out in Bloomberg, these companies still face a host of technological, regulatory, and social hurdles, and the huge amounts of money flooding into the sector may be hard to justify.
Regardless of which companies make it out the other side, it’s looking increasingly likely that air taxis will be a significant new player in urban transport by the end of the decade.

According to the United Nations, the world’s population continues to rise. By 2050, it is expected to increase by 2 billion to reach 9.7 billion. Around 2100, it could peak at nearly 11 billion. Currently, about 55 percent of the world’s population lives in cities; in the coming 30 years, this percentage will reach 68%. This means more pressure on the world’s cities to provide better sustainability management, resource utilization, and urban areas development.
The solution lies in smarter cities.
What Is a Smart City?
Smart cities use IoT devices to collect and analyze data and allow automation and tasks to be carried out without human intervention. Diverse IoT devices are connected and communicate for different tasks.
Cities use the information collected to improve infrastructure, public utilities, services, and more. Smart cities are more efficient and safe to live in, providing a higher quality lifestyle for their residents.
The Growth of IoT
IoT is set to grow into one of the smartest collective and collaborative systems in history. According to numbers from the “Improving Internet of Things (IoT) Security with Software-Defined Network (SDN)” study, there will be more than 75.44 billion connected IoT devices by 2025, over 7.33 billion mobile users by 2023, and more than 1,105 million connected wearable devices users by 2022.IoT-enabled smart cities offer a solution to many of our population-related social problems. Take a deeper look at the solutions a smart city provides.Click To Tweet
What does it mean to be a smart city? Already, the overall value of worldwide deals related to smart cities between the first quarter of 2019 and the last quarter of 2020 totaled $17.24 billion. This represents a 123.48 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase. Different sectors of smart cities include:
Smart homes: Residences containing devices connected to the internet. Devices such as lights, fridges, and televisions communicate with each other and share data to users.Smart healthcare: Wearable and nonwearable devices that can monitor and measure the activities of user health, measuring temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugar, and many other factors.Smart environment: Intelligent sensors installed for the development of city infrastructure. These sensors control and monitor the conditions of the surroundings (such as air quality and lighting) to provide a healthier environment.Smart transportation: Optimized services and innovative devices enhance city transportation. These services can include smart parking, traffic flow, number plate recognition, supply chain management and so on.Smart surveillance: A diverse array of security and surveillance devices are installed around the city to prevent incidents from occurring and for quick action in case of an emergency.
According to a study by IoT Analytics, smart cities prioritize IoT technology in several interesting ways. The top priorities among decision-makers from some of the world’s leading smart cities are:
Connected public transport (74%)Traffic monitoring and management (72%)Water level / flood monitoring (72%)Video surveillance and analytics (72%)Connected streetlights (68%)Weather monitoring (68%)Air quality / Pollution monitoring (68%)Smart metering – water (66%)Fire / smoke detection (66%)Water quality monitoring (64%)
Let’s take a look at these smart city applications in more detail.
Public Transport
Key goals of any city’s public transport system include greater efficiency and reliability. Smart technology is key to enabling just this. For example, the Polish city of Lublin implemented an innovative passenger information system for connected public transport that revolutionized the city’s bus transit system. Smart devices were installed on vehicles to transmit real-time data to a dispatch center software. This software then relays that information to electronic displays at bus stops and online portals to inform users of the real-time status of their transport options.
Traffic Monitoring
Managing traffic flow is one of the biggest challenges for today’s cities. Smart city devices can ease traffic pain points and improve safety. In Los Angeles, the government installed a network of sensors that transmit real-time traffic updates to a traffic management platform. The platform then adjusts the timing of traffic signals to optimize traffic flow.
Water Level Monitoring
Especially with the real impacts of climate change and urban sprawl, flooding has become a problem in cities worldwide. Smart sensors installed in key areas can detect water levels and report flooding incidents or potential flooding incidents in real-time.
Smart Video Surveillance
Smart video surveillance has been around for a long time, and these cameras are commonly used to police the world’s roads and highways. ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras are also commonly used by law enforcement to identify stolen cars, enforce traffic control, collect tolls and deter crime. Today’s smart video surveillance cameras work within an integrated security system to predict crimes before they even happen.
Connected Streetlights
Connected streetlights and lighting solutions have many benefits, including reducing energy consumption and costs, reducing maintenance costs, increased public safety, safer traffic, and measurable environmental impact. Today’s smart streetlights can also double up as EV chargers and monitor emissions and serve as wireless broadband connection points.
Weather Monitoring

Smart, real-time, and predictive weather monitoring helps city management predict and manage weather disruptions and severe weather events.
Snow forecasting could be help cities assess where best to station their snowplows (as well as assess the maintenance status and availability of snowplows). Determining where extra cooling may be required (especially for senior citizens or disabled residents). Micro-forecasts of rain, fog, and snow could be linked to accident data to predict and prevent the likelihood of traffic accidents. Wind and temperature data allows first responders to plan where best to position firefighters to deal with a wildfire.
Air Quality Monitoring
Smart cities aim to provide a decent quality of life to their citizens by offering a clean and sustainable environment. Air quality monitoring helps city management to identify and mitigate the sources of pollution. Using a network of low-cost air quality monitoring sensors, the city can detect sources of pollution and take corrective measures to improve the city’s environmental health.
Smart Metering
The smart meter or automated meter reader is a top IoT device among utility companies. These devices attach to or replace traditional utility meters to provide real-time consumption data, allowing the utility companies to manage energy flow more effectively. This includes identifying and implementing resource efficiencies for a lower carbon footprint.
Fire and Smoke Detection
Having fire and smoke detectors around a city improves emergency management and preparedness. Smart fire and smoke detection sensors provide real-time information about the direction, location, or magnitude. The prediction and early detection of fire and smoke in smart cities can reduce large-scale damage and improve public safety significantly, in addition to warning city management, mass warning systems that can provide emergency alerts to the city’s population.
Water Quality Monitoring
Water hygiene is a crucial aspect of city safety. One of the ways that water safety is enabled through smart technology is with an automated Legionella compliance system, which automates the process of Legionella management and compliance. Instead of manually taking readings of every water outlet, the system takes the temperature of the water and flushes the system at regular intervals. Automated reporting and record-keeping saves time and ensures accuracy.
It’s time for cities to graduate to a smarter solution.
Connected smart city devices make everyday tasks easier and more efficient while relieving pain points related to public safety, traffic, and environmental issues. To make smart cities viable, the technology needs to be scalable, affordable, secure, and easy to deploy. Smarter Technologies’ Orion Data Network ticks all the boxes, helping cities worldwide become safer, cleaner, and better places to live for the world’s growing population.

After a number of deaths in the US linked to Tesla owners placing too much faith in autonomous driving systems – and amid ongoing investigations by road safety regulators there – Elon Musk says mastering the tech is more difficult than he expected.
Tesla boss Elon Musk has finally admitted what many automotive industry experts have long realised: autonomous vehicle technology is a lot more difficult than it seems, due to the countless variables a car must learn, detect, and avoid while on the move.
In addition to being able to detect lanes, other vehicles, traffic signals and pedestrian movement, fully autonomous cars must learn to pre-empt the behaviour of other drivers and pedestrians in the same way a human would, an almost impossible task.
On social media platform Twitter this week – in response to a query about Tesla’s next update on autonomous tech – Elon Musk wrote: “FSD 9 (Full Self Driving 9) beta is shipping soon I swear! Generalized (autonomous) self-driving is a hard problem, as it requires solving a large part of real-world AI (artificial intelligence).
“Didn’t expect it to be so hard, but the difficulty is obvious in retrospect. Nothing has more degrees of freedom than reality.”
The admission by Elon Musk is being regarded as a relief to industry observers, as car companies have grappled with the roll-out of the technology and, in the US at least, regulators are increasingly keeping a close eye on real-world driving tests of the future tech.
In October 2017 a high-ranking autonomous vehicle expert at US car giant General Motors said Tesla’s claim that it already had the technology for total hands-free driving was “full of crap”.
At the time, Elon Musk said Tesla cars “already have the hardware needed for a full self-driving capability”, known in the industry as a “Level Five” engineering standard.
However in a briefing with Australian media in Detroit at the time, Scott Miller, General Motors’ director of autonomous vehicle integration said: “I think he’s full of crap”, when asked what he thought about Musk’s claim.
“If you think you can see everything you need for a Level Five autonomous (car) with cameras and radar, I don’t know how you do that,” Mr Miller told media in October 2017.
“To be what an SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) Level Five full autonomous system is, I don’t think he (Elon Musk) has the content to do that. Do you really want to trust one sensor measuring the speed of a car coming into an intersection before you pull out? I think you need some confirmation.”
The car industry is now of the view each sensor in an autonomous vehicle needs confirmation from one or more other sensors before making a critical decision, which adds cost and requires phenomenal processing speeds not seen before in automobiles.
While not backing away from his push for autonomous cars, it appears Musk is developing a more level-headed approach to the technology, especially in the wake of fatalities in the US involving Tesla drivers that placed way too much reliance on the self-driving systems.
In a YouTube interview with US automotive industry expert Sandy Munro in February 2021, Musk said: “For self-driving (technology), even if the road is painted completely wrong and a UFO lands in the middle of the road, the car still cannot crash and still needs to do the right thing.”
He continued: “The prime directive for the autopilot system is ‘don’t crash’. That really over-rides everything, no many what the lines say or how the road is done … minimise the probability of impact while getting you to your destination conveniently and comfortably.
Musk said at the time while it would “certainly be helpful to have roads with accurate markings” the car needs to be smarter than that.
“For self-driving, it’s got to be even if someone tries to trick the car (that) they do not succeed in tricking the car, because people will do weird things, it’s got to be maintain safety no matter what … don’t let yourself (Tesla autonomous tech) get tricked.”

South Africa’s economy is easing back towards levels of activity last seen before the Covid-19 lockdown. Logistics fleets are returning to full capacity, and private travel is now similarly back to previous levels.
The reason we can confidently make this assertion is the vast amounts of data now available to us about movement on South African roads. As an operator in the vehicle recovery and fleet management space, we have access to this data.
This data now informs pivotal strategic decisions, it drives business planning, efficiency enhancements, and life-and-death safety initiatives. The source of this vast ocean of information is that popular current buzzword – the Internet of Things (IoT).
IoT technology has been around for decades – even if its name is more recent. Tracking and monitoring devices have long been in use – employing radio and satellite methodology, and later 3G and LTE platforms.
The move towards the mass, high-speed connectivity promised by 5G mobile broadband promises to take the industry to a new level of insight, providing critical data that vastly improves customer services, safety, and profitability.
No longer are IoT insights a nice-to-have capability, or simply a security concern. They are vital. No business operating in the mobility space can afford to ignore the value of IoT.
IoT finds application in several aspects of modern business. In public transport, for instance, camera technology is now used to monitor driver behaviour as well as social-distancing and safety compliance.
Newer-generation cameras are capable of image recognition, customer counts and even remote infrared body-temperature screening.
Initially, short-range RF technology simply told customers the location of their vehicles. As the technology progressed, we were able to gather more information through GPS trackers, cameras and ever more precise sensors.
Today, companies can assess and modify driving behaviour. This has opened up opportunities for both consumers as well as insurers and vehicle finance companies. They can now offer personalised premiums and encourage efficient, safe driving that benefits drivers, businesses and society at large.
We have seen our offering evolve from tracking to connectivity and data management. Technology also now lets us give clients access to data platforms and dashboards where they can manage and customise their own track-and-trace service.
Clients can also now take ownership of their own security, setting geofencing and alert parameters for their vehicles and family members.
Commercial transport firms can set up automated logbooks, panic buttons and driver alerts.
In the consumer space, the next step of technological evolution is the understanding of the car as a permanently connected information and entertainment hub.
When the connected car can guarantee broadband access, the final piece of the puzzle falls into place. We can now move seamlessly between our home, vehicle and office environments while remaining connected throughout. This is the dawn of the Connected Life.
Thanks to IoT, this state of eternal connectivity generates constant, exponentially growing amounts of data. The challenge, and the true differentiator in an IoT space where equipment is largely commoditised, is how to use and interpret that information.
Data enrichment is the new frontier. A company such as ours has moved from simple vehicle tracking, into the Big Data space. We have built our own Big Data platform, in partnership with Stellenbosch University, which we launched about two years ago. The platform currently processes around 300 million data points per day.
Big Data platforms allow for the provision of data-centric services such as predictive models. For instance, insurance companies can now use drivers’ unique biometric data-sets to identify when performance is impaired due to fatigue or alcohol. In this way, IoT enables the evolution from accident reconstruction to accident prevention, using the power of data.
As far as claims validation goes, data analysis powered by artificial intelligence can make this an almost instantaneous process. 
Another trend we are seeing is OEMs entering the data and connectivity space. While this transition has not yet reached its ultimate form, based on our global partnerships with Toyota, we anticipate carmakers taking ownership of engine- and vehicle-centric information and its connectivity.
Supplementary services, such as theft recovery, and jamming detection will likely be provided by local suppliers. With the rise of the connected vehicle, infotainment will become another differentiator, and possibly another income stream for OEMs, or third-party suppliers.
The final stage of this data-centric move to connected mobility may be the establishment of a single, interoperable data platform, shared by cars, infrastructure, service providers and governments. Until such a scenario arrives, we will see connectivity gradually gaining in significance as the key enabler of movement.
It must not be overlooked that these oceans of data that our mobility now generates come with significant security risks. Cybersecurity is now a mobility issue, and we’ll need to keep building technologies and policies to protect our customers and their data.
The key is proactive threat management, using artificial intelligence to proactively anticipate and manage such threats on a dedicated cybersecurity platform.
IoT is the technology that has transformed modern business. That transformation is taking place in several spaces at once – safety, mobility, accessibility, sustainability, cost control, operations, information and analytics.
Each of these areas offers opportunities for organisations able to build proficiencies themselves, or to build partnerships to provide such services. In an emerging platform economy, where data is ubiquitous, the organizations with the platforms to deliver services using that data will dominate.
Technology is no longer a differentiator, but an enabler. It enables the objectives and strategies of organizations, so they can serve their customers and be competitive. As such, it is indispensable. IoT, overlaid with AI, is no longer a grudge purchase. It’s essential.

 Tapping into multiple services, both inside and outside a car, requires a rethinking of everything from architectures to security. 
 BY: ANN STEFFORA MUTSCHLER
Carmakers are reworking their electronic architectures so they can tap into a growing number of external services and internal options, similar to the way a data center taps into various services over its internal network.
In the past, this has been largely confined to internal services such as on-board Internet connectivity, and external traffic routing and music. The current vision is to greatly expand those offerings through faster internal and external communications. But making that all work will require changes on multiple fronts.
The complexity in chips and systems in vehicles is exploding even without considering these new services. Automotive OEMs and their suppliers have been gradually increasing the number of ECUs in vehicles, along with multiple millions of lines of code to enable new features and capabilities. Now, with increasing levels of assisted and autonomous driving being added, that complexity has skyrocketed, rendering the old approach unsustainable.
As competition heats up, the long-established tiered supplier ecosystem is starting to re-orient itself around what consumers want, some of which may be offered by automakers and some of which will become available as infrastructure is built up around vehicles. That includes smart cities, vehicle-to-infrastructure, and localized edge services, and it impacts how communications are structured within a vehicle, how that data traffic is prioritized, and how the compute infrastructure is partitioned. It also determines which ECUs get consolidated, how all of this is tied together within a vehicle, as well as the overall software-driven, service-oriented architectures (SOAs).
SOAs are relatively new in the auto sector because until recently it’s been a one-to-one match between the software and hardware from the Tier 1 or 2 supplier, and they could not be unbundled.
“That’s gone with the changes happening within the automotive ecosystem,” noted David Fritz, senior director for autonomous and ADAS at Siemens Digital Industries Software. “New vehicle architectures are designed to solve very complex problems and get around a lot of the supplier and technology limitations of existing vehicles to ask, ‘How in the world do we architect software to fit that?’ Engineering teams are used to modeling in MATLAB, pushing a button, having the tool generate some C code for their controller, then be done. In a service-oriented architecture (SOA), you don’t even know where that software is going to run. You don’t know if it’s going to run in a hypervisor. You don’t know whether or not you’re going to have full control of that microcontroller, or if something could be downloaded much later that could impact your performance. How in the world do you do that? This points back to digital twins that need to provide simulation results to indicate where the boundaries are. At the same time, the design of the whole system software architecture is dramatically different because it is dynamically allocated, not statically allocated, and meshed one-to-one to the hardware.”
Utilizing service-oriented architecturesAnother way to think about SOAs is in terms of the zonal architecture concepts that have been discussed more broadly in the industry.
For a service-oriented architecture, there are a few different ways to go about it, including a zonal approach. “When you look at the geography of the car, you have to consider how to chop things up,” said Kurt Shuler, vice president of marketing at Arteris IP. “As part of the ECU consolidation discussion, zonal can be one approach such that, for example, ‘the antilock braking system is usually next to this other subsystem, so let’s put those together, and we’ll make that one electronic system that’ll cover all that stuff.’ However, there are still some who say all of this is going to go together, like a centralized architecture where there is a common brain, which makes sense from a functional safety and redundancy standpoint.”
Zonal architectures are a big deal. “The whole automotive industry is moving to that new architecture because it’s required for autonomous driving to have a more centralized computing infrastructure, but also some distributed multi-purpose, zonal controllers that can take care of all the sensors, and so forth,” said Robert Schweiger, director of automotive solutions at Cadence. “In order to have this, you need high-speed in-vehicle communication, so Ethernet will evolve toward 10 gigabit very soon from 1 gigabit, where we are now. Also, the Automotive Service Alliance is putting its own standard in place for this, which is quite interesting because at the same time last year, MIPI released the MIPI A-PHYi, which should exactly address this thing. So now there are two competing standards going forward that will take us to 16 gigabit per second to solve the connectivity from the Ethernet network to the endpoints — the sensors, for instance — using SerDes type of communication. Within the cloud from ECU to ECU, or to the central computing unit, it will be definitely Ethernet. This means more OEMs will be adopting these high-speed communication standards, because it enables so many other things. With that, you need high-integration ECUs. The central compute units are really massive computers with very complex, very powerful SoCs sitting in the middle. Then, the zonal controllers, if they will be multi-purpose, smaller computing units, basically will evolve as an incarnation of the multiple consolidated ECUs that we have nowadays in the car.”
This is the general direction, but tradeoff discussions around how to structure the architecture are still evolving. Set in the context of Automotive Ethernet (AE) and the additional bandwidth that it brings, it is possible to boot up an entire vehicle using an SOA, with each individual components having its own boot flash.
“Here, it can come up and say, ‘I need access to these services, wherever those services are.’ It could be in the same printed circuit board, it could be on the other end of the vehicle, it could be anywhere, and it actually doesn’t matter where it is. Once you register for those services, if it’s monitoring, for example, a dashboard, there would be monitoring data sent to the speedometer and tachometer. The transmission could also send information,” Fritz explained.
From a functional standpoint, this requires a number of considerations. “With an SOA, a lot of functions are being virtualized that may have some interdependency,” Shuler said. “There could be some interdependency, or they could be completely independent of each other, running out of this single architecture. SOA essentially covers those two parts of the spectrum of where the processing is done, and then what is that processing, and what kind of services? What kind of capabilities does it provide to the vehicle and the overall system. This creates a conflict between, on one end, ‘I’m going to have a microprocessor for every function in the car,’ and ‘I’m going to run everything on a centralized mainframe.’”
It also has a ripple effect on other pieces of the system architecture.
“Whenever you’re dealing with software [like AUTOSAR], it’s great when you don’t have huge meta functions, and you’re able to slice these in there,” Shuler said. “But when there are huge functions, like for autonomous driving, this is where things get maybe more zonal/hierarchical. It’s a mother-daughter type system relationship between multiple aspects. And that’s from a hardware standpoint. There’s also a software brain controlling everything. But when you look at the actual hardware, it’s literally in different places. That’s because of modularity in the architecture based on the old subsystem approach. When there are different subsystems, you want to have some flexibility. There are starting to be more standards for data interchange and different types of processing, as well as the ability to do some pre-processing on the data. Then, instead of sending all the bits over, you can say, ‘Here’s this data format that shows what objects are over there, which could be from a lidar, radar, or camera, but the object classifications have to be there.”
There are a few ways automotive ecosystem players can start exploring SOA. The primary approach was borrowed from the robot industry, called ROS, or robot operating system.
“A few years ago, companies started applying the ROS service-oriented concept to prototype cars, and it’s still very new. Most people don’t even know that it’s needed, let alone exists, but it’s in a process of being reworked and revamped, and currently there are SOA architectures based on ROS,” said Siemens’ Fritz. “Early explorations into that highlighted the pros and cons, and we’re taking that now into the OEMs, saying, ‘Until you can sort out what you want, ROS is a really good place to start.’ The only question is, even if you’re using ROS, that’s kind of like the communication layer for an SOA. On top of that, you need semantic information. For instance, how do you find the right balance between what a smart city infrastructure does, and what the vehicle does onboard?”
Security concernsThere are security implications for smart city infrastructures interacting with a vehicle’s architecture, not all of which have been fully addressed.
“In the communication between cars and their surroundings, this brings up fundamental questions about performance and security,” Thierry Kouthon, technical product manager at Rambus Security said. “Here, security is mostly about authentication. You have to make sure that the car that is talking to you is actually a car, and that it is a genuine car from a genuine manufacturer, not some hacker, or some adversarial entity trying to send fake signals or jam your reactions. This requires public key cryptography in order for cars to authenticate each other, so I know that the 100 signals that I’ve received from all those cars that are surrounding me are from actual cars from Volkswagen, Mercedes, General Motors, etc.”
In order to do that, you need two things. First, a root of trust is essential to ensure that nobody can pervasively inspect the cryptographic processing, and the cryptographic operation while being processed.
“You need that on both sides,” Kouthon said. “In addition to the communication in the V2X context, security must be inside the vehicle itself. Modern cars are more like computers on wheels than what they were conceived of 50 years ago, for several reasons. A typical car contains 50 to 100 computers for steering, cruise control, entertainment, instrumentation, brake lights, you name it. It has a lot of components, with each of these components being computerized, and 70% of those components have been provided by suppliers to the OEM, not by the OEM itself. How do you make sure that everybody that is supplying something to you is genuine and that it’s not injecting the car with something malicious?”
Second, all these computers communicate via a network — the CAN bus — which is ubiquitous in cars, and typically is not featured with any security for cost reasons, Kouthon explained. “It’s not because the OEMs and Tier 1s don’t know how to make it secure. It’s because vehicle margins are slim. It’s a big bus. It’s a lot of wiring, and making it very secure will cost money, increase the car’s bill of materials, etc. The approach now is to put the security inside the electronic control units (ECUs), because each one of these ECUs has a computer inside the processor, and since we cannot secure the network between the processors, instead the processors are secured so that when they talk to each other, regardless of the communication medium, they can authenticate each other.”
For security in a smart city, it’s essentially about electronic warfare and countermeasures, and all devices utilized must be suited for those applications, said Willard Tu, director of automotive at Xilinx. “You want to make sure people aren’t spoofing your lidar or radar data, sending you misinformation. And that’s what happens in [a military] battle zone, and none of us want to think about it, but that’s what electronic countermeasures are trying to do — confuse your sensor array and take it over if possible.”
This is familiar ground for security, even though it’s an ongoing challenge. “Fundamentally, within those types of environments security always boils down into having base properties in place,” said Jason Oberg, CTO of Tortuga Logic. “You want to encrypt everything, making sure no one can steal the information. And then you want to make sure that all your information is signed and authentic, meaning that if I send something to another vehicle, or to a building, or to a sign or part of the infrastructure, that it’s authentically coming from me — and not an attacker on the side of the road with their laptop and an antenna, injecting material into the system that causes it to think it’s me, and then my car behaves differently. It sounds simple, but because everything is so distributed, it’s a mess of key management, and how to update who is who. How do I know that the keys that I have to say ‘I’m Jason,’ are the most up to date keys? Who’s the central owner of all that? On the Internet there are certificate authorities that say, ‘This is Google,’ so that when you go to Google, you can trust that it is Google. Everything that’s coming from them is signed. That same kind of infrastructure is needed for automobiles.”
All of this needs to be stored down at the hardware level in a vehicle. “In your laptop, you control it, unless someone steals it, and with infrastructure someone could just climb up a telephone pole and muck with something so it’s a different attack model,” Oberg said. “For this reason, it is really important to have everything routed down into the actual chip, and that’s where the root of trust is really important. Those keys need to be stored securely somewhere.”
Additionally, the level of communication that will be required to make it possible for vehicles to interface with any and all manner of infrastructure will be massive, and 5G is the obvious technology to enable it. That will ratchet up the need for edge computing, AI, and increased verification.
“The complexities involved with making sure these communications happen safely and securely will be astounding,” said Jorg Grosse, product manager for functional safety at OneSpin Solutions. “Formal verification will play a crucial role in the verification of the integrated circuits that will power this intelligent communication. The technology will go beyond simply making sure designs operate as intended. It also must ensure that safety and security vulnerabilities and weaknesses are eliminated.”
As smart cities evolve alongside autonomous developments, 5G is emerging as the common denominator.
“For V2X, they want to use 5G for the communications,” said Ron DiGiuseppe, automotive IP segment manager at Synopsys. “In fact, the 3GPP implemented specific features in 5G that would make it more useful for automotive, one of which is improved reliability, and of course, improved bandwidth. It’s important to make sure that if there’s also policy-based data rates, that they’ve added some prioritization. This means when data gets communicated over that 5G link, if someone in the back seat is streaming a movie for their rear seat entertainment, the last thing you want is that streaming data to interfere with the safety-critical data such as V2X or autonomous driving. 5G has specific features that allow it to prioritize the data. That helps for safety applications. When it comes to V2X and autonomous, the autonomous application uses 5G for that very high resolution mapping for the path planning, and the V2X uses 5G for the V2X communications. Then, the rear seat entertainment would be using 5G to stream the movie smoothly. This means we have to make sure both of those applications, the V2X and the autonomous — since they’ll both be running over 5G and need to share the bandwidth — will run simultaneously.”
Further, Grosse expects continuous product lifecycle verification to be adopted, as well, because there will be a wide range in the age of devices communicating with one another, while keeping up with the constant evolution of security requirements.
ConclusionGiven the complexity, and still-evolving SOA solutions, making the transition to SOA may be a nightmare.
“If you’re a traditional automotive player, you’re not used to dealing with a billion lines of code, or hundreds of millions of lines of code, or tens of millions of lines of code, but now you’re having to deal with that,” said Arteris IP’s Shuler. “If you’re a startup and you’re entering automotive, maybe you came over from some AI point of view. Or maybe you worked at a Qualcomm on digital baseband modems, and then you have all these other requirements, expectations, information sharing and things that you used to have 100% control over. Now you don’t, because of what your customers’ customer is saying is totally different. Everybody in the automotive ecosystem has to change. Traditional car suppliers have to get a little bit more flexible. The car companies have to learn to be more nimble, but that requires more risk. And then the folks who are coming into the industry from industries where risk was acceptable, they have to be more diligent about process and put in more bounding boxes.”

“Autonomous cars will be here in 2 years” has been a standard sentence from the industry for the past 5 years or so. Now there is good reason to expect autonomous ride-hailing services to hit our roads within 3 years. So, what has happened in the last year in the world of autonomy to give this confidence boost?
 Well, a few things actually. Breaking the previous year down into the most significant advancements: COVID-19 has kick-started the next phase of autonomous testing, technology maturity continues to more than double year on year, sensor prices are coming down and performance is increasing, and there are genuine autonomous services available, just in very limited conditions. To mark Autonomous Vehicle Day, observed on May 31, this article examines progress in more detail.
The impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly had a devastating impact on the world over the past year or so. However, opportunity can often be found in the face of adversity, and this was the case for autonomy. At the beginning of the pandemic, the companies that had been testing autonomous services with safety/backup drivers behind the wheel (Waymo, Cruise, Baidu, Pony, etc.) were forced to cease testing. 
There was concern about the social contact between the riders and the safety drivers being a factor in spreading the pandemic. Here is where the opportunity was presented; it seemed that the safest way to continue testing was without the safety driver behind the wheel. In July 2020, AutoX became the first MaaS company1 to gain a driverless testing license, a world-first which allowed them to operate driverless vehicles in California. The new license type allowed them to operate a fully autonomous service in San Jose, limited to roads with a posted speed limit of 45mph or less. 
Following that, another six companies have been granted similar licenses in California and others have gained similar licenses for parts of China. COVID-19 may have been the catalyst needed to transition from safety-driver-based testing to fully autonomous testing. This is not to say that the industry was not ready for the transition, but the pandemic definitely put pressure on the governing bodies to progress to the next step.
Technology maturity
MaaS operators have been testing their autonomous solutions in California since 2015, and since then they have been publishing reports about the performance of their systems. The most important outcome from this data is the miles per disengagement metric, which describes the average distance an autonomous vehicle can travel without human intervention. IDTechEx‘s analysis of this data shows exponential growth in the miles per disengagement, with the figure more than doubling each year. 
By extrapolating this growth IDTechEx predicts that within 3 years autonomous vehicles will be performing more safely than the average American driver. IDTechEx even went one step further and found that within 25 years autonomous vehicles will be able to travel the same annual distance as the entire US fleet without a single disengagement. There are still obstacles to overcome, such as testing in more urbanized areas and the establishment of cost-effective sensor suites. Waymo and Cruise have recently gained permission to test in the urban centers of San Francisco which will help with the former.

Last month, self-driving technology company TuSimple shipped a truckload of watermelons across the state of Texas ten hours faster than normal. They did this by using their automated driving system for over 900 miles of the journey. The test drive was considered a success, and marked the beginning of a partnership between TuSimple and produce distributor Guimarra. This is one of the first such partnerships announced, but TuSimple may soon have some competition from another big player in the driverless vehicles game: Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Waymo.
Yesterday, Waymo announced a partnership with transportation logistics company JB Hunt to move cargo in automated trucks in Texas. The first route they’ll drive is between Houston and Fort Worth, which Waymo claims is “one of the most highly utilized freight corridors in the country.”
At around 260 miles long, much of the route is a straight shot on Interstate 45. The trucks will have human safety drivers on board who will likely take over some of the city driving portions, but the goal is to use the automated system as much as possible. A software technician will be on board as well, which makes sense given software will be doing the bulk of the driving.
Waymo has been testing driverless trucks in Texas since last August, when it established a hub in Dallas from which to deploy its fleet of 18-wheelers, complete with cameras, lidar, and on-board computers. It’s no coincidence that the Lone Star State is getting so much driverless action; its mild climate and vast highway network make for a lot of space to drive and a lot of time throughout the year to do so—and a 2017 bill allows vehicles to operate without a driver there.
There are five levels of automation in driving, or if you count level 0 (where there’s no automation at all and a human driver is fully in control at all times), six. At Level 5—full autonomy—the vehicle can drive itself anywhere (around cities, on highways, on rural roads, etc.) in any conditions (rain, sun, fog, etc.) without human intervention.
Waymo’s technology, called Waymo Driver (“the world’s most experienced driver,” if the company has its way) is considered Level 4, which means it could operate without a safety driver under certain conditions (namely, good weather). “This will be one of the first opportunities for JB Hunt to receive data and feedback on customer freight moved with a Class 8 tractor operating at this level of autonomy,” said Craig Harper, JB Hunt’s chief sustainability officer and executive vice president.
Despite looming concerns over job losses due to automation in trucking, proponents say that not only will self-driving technology help fill an ongoing shortage of drivers, it will improve safety on roads and decrease food waste, since shipments will arrive to their final destinations faster. JB Hunt, Harper said, believes “there will be a need for highly skilled, professional drivers for many years to come,” but autonomous technologies will improve efficiency and safety.
Whether it’s TuSimple, Waymo, or other players left to enter the field (or in this case, the state of Texas), it seems we’ll soon be finding out if that’s the case.

Five years ago, the expectation was that by 2020 the sight of ‘robotaxis’ and autonomous driverless trucks would be a common sight on our streets. 
Their absence today shows that tech and transport industries have woken up to the fact that creating autonomous vehicles — capable of safely dealing with mixed traffic and hundreds of other variables — is a bigger technical challenge than first imagined. 
Although expectations have been reset to a more reasonable timeframe, the speed of development is still terrific, and the prize for success is access to a multi-billion dollar market.  
“For autonomous driving to take off on-highway we need three things to happen,” said Nils Jaeger, president of Volvo Autonomous Solutions.
“We need to master the technology – especially of perception systems that allow vehicles to travel at high speeds. Secondly, we need society to trust us when we say this new tech is beneficial, and finally we need legislators to adapt laws to give autonomous vehicles access to the highways. It’s a puzzle and we need all the pieces to fall into place.”
While robotaxis are still on the industry’s wish list, the first on-road application for autonomous driving is likely to be in trucking, especially of the hub-to-hub type found in the United States’ interstate highway system.
“As the Volvo Group is one of the world’s largest truck manufacturers, we are putting a lot of effort into solving this problem and developing a credible offering,” Jaeger said. “The creation of Volvo Autonomous Solutions is a clear statement of intent that we want to be a leader in this field.”
Off-highway reality 
Autonomous vehicles may be applicable to on-road yet, but in the confined areas of off-road, autonomous driving technology is mature enough to offer credible alternatives. For off-road, Volvo Autonomous Solutions is focusing on two industry segments, ports and logistics centres, and light mines and quarries.  
Volvo Autonomous Solutions is perhaps unique in its ability to offer automated solutions for both on and off road. With truck and construction divisions within the Volvo Group to source equipment from, and partnerships with Silicon Valley companies and AI leaders to develop autonomous driving architecture.
The company has already developed the TA-15 autonomous quarry hauler solution. It runs on a battery-electric drivetrain and uses GNSS, lidar, radar and multiple sensors. Being selfdriving, the TA-15 has no need for a cabin – making for a dramatically new machine profile. 
“Our approach is to start small, in a tightly confined environment and build on our successes over time,” Jaeger said. “Ports, quarries and light mines fit this profile, as they have clearly defined load-and-drop locations, over generally short circuits. And with carefully mapped out safety plans, there is no need for regulatory changes.” 
Based at Volvo’s Camp X innovation hub in Gothenburg, Sweden, the 51-year-old Jaeger took up his role in the newly formed Volvo Autonomous Solutions on Jan. 1, 2020.
Previously spending 17 years of his career in the agricultural equipment sector, he is no stranger to automated systems. He witnessed first hand the arrival of autonomous steering systems for tractors and harvesting machines, tech that is now embedded in the sector. 
“I’m absolutely convinced that autonomous solutions are beneficial to society,” he said. “This new industry will provide a lot of value – safety, efficiency, flexibility, sustainability and economic. It is impossible to stop progress – this technology is going to happen – and I firmly believe that it will be a force for good. In fact, if we had been further ahead in our development the impact of COVID-19 would have been less.”
When challenged on fears of autonomous machines taking human operator jobs, Jaeger explained “there are already shortages of drivers in many markets, and human operators will continue to be in demand for many years to come.
“Far from being a threat, autonomous vehicles will be complimentary, doing jobs more safely than humans can, such as very long distance highway driving, or removing humans from worksite applications in hazardous areas, such as blast furnaces, unstable demolition sites or underground mines. As with the creation of the car or the computer, this technology will for sure be a creator of many new jobs.”
What about the fear that some people have about driverless vehicles being let loose on highways and work sites? 
“Fear is never a good advisor, so as an industry we need to come together and address those concerns,” Jaeger said.
“Not only must autonomous solutions be safe, we must demonstrate it unequivocally to reassure the public. That’s not just product safety, but also protection against cybercrime interference, which we are also working hard on preventing. The irony here is that one of the biggest benefits of this technology is that it will improve safety and reduce harm. There is already a healthy debate going on, and we need to be better at spelling out that key benefit.”
Transport as a service
Autonomous vehicles offer more than a like-for-like switch with human operated machines, but rather whole new business models and customer relationships. 
Transport as a service is a growing trend, and tailoring fleets of machines to suit customers’ individual needs is a key element of Volvo Autonomous Solutions’ remit. 
“We see ourselves as an integrator of emerging technologies to create solutions, bundling hardware and software, and then if necessary, operating it on behalf of the customer,” Jaeger said.
Autonomous vehicles will be a service to wider society. There remains several mountains to climb before reaching the goal of reliable, productive, sustainable and safe autonomous transport solutions. But Jaeger remains undaunted.
“To ensure that it is understood as beneficial to society we need to master the componentry by proving that it is truly safe,” he said. 
“We also need to reassure legislators and promote the many benefits by being good stewards of this technology.”

While the future of the automotive industry is still unwritten, here is what we know: Industry leaders will need to master connectivity to deliver the V2X (vehicle-to-everything) capabilities fully autonomous driving promises.
Autonomous driving is both an audacious visionary goal and a highly achievable feat of technical engineering. The race to launching the industry’s first fully autonomous car is accelerating, as technology companies like Apple and Waymo battle car companies Audi, Ford, Tesla, Renault, Waymo and ride sharing companies Lyft and Uber to overcome technical challenges and enable an entirely new way of driving that will surprise and delight users.
Who will win the race? And how will driverless cars transform society? While the future of the automotive industry is still unwritten, here is what we know: Industry leaders will need to master connectivity to deliver the V2X (vehicle-to-everything) capabilities fully autonomous driving promises. Here’s an overview of six key connectivity requirements to make that happen.
Architectures Must Be Redundant and Real-time
Autonomous driving will increasingly demand more and more reliable network-based structures, requiring redundant, real-time architectures. These architectures will organize high performance clusters in functional domains and be connected via a central gateway in a high-speed data backbone structure. Group sensors and actuators will be organized hierarchically.
Functional domains for connected, autonomous vehicles with high speed in-vehicle networks.
The Demand for High-Speed Data Will Only Increase
Driverless cars will have incredibly sophisticated systems, including high performance computers and an increasing number of advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) sensors, such as high-resolution stereo and/or mono cameras, RADAR, and LIDAR, as well as future human-machine interfaces (HMIs), such as large 4K/8K screens or head-up displays (HUDs).
These systems will generate vast amounts of data, which will require sophisticated electronic support, including high-speed data nodes, links, cables, and assemblies. The inside of the driverless car will literally be an information highway, and data streams will run in parallel or different directions. They’ll be managed in switched networks with sufficient margin to ensure the car’s safe operations.  
Car manufacturers will be required to continuously increase bandwidths for both point-to-point data pipes and distributed network structures to meet new data demands. Level 5 cars will send 25 gigabytes of data to the cloud every hour.
TE Connectivity (TE) has developed gigabit-speed networks that enable global automotive OEMs to meet these connectivity requirements. TE helps automotive leaders achieve their goals, by providing connectivity solutions that overcome myriad mechanical, electrical, and software protocol and interface compatibility challenges.

Safety and Other Applications Require External Connectivity
V2X communications must continuously capture and interpret complete data concerning the surrounding environment. Fully autonomous vehicles require all of this information to correctly execute actions such as braking or accelerating without driver assistance.
V2X communications uses both sensor technology and radio-based communication. Car sensors help vehicle systems interact with their immediate surroundings. Radio systems enable vehicles to exchange information with other vehicles and with traffic infrastructure such as lights, signs and tolls. These surroundings actively communicate their state and changing conditions around them to the vehicle. Thus, a light communicates that it is about to change from red to green, a sign indicates that the next turn-off is five miles ahead, and a vehicle a lane over communicates that it is about to signal and turn right. All of these signals make driving safer. Information on driving conditions, such as icy roads ahead, traffic slowdowns, or tolls, can also enable vehicles to interpret data and make automated decisions, such as choosing another route.
Drivers make decisions in split-seconds, and fully autonomous cars will, too. To be safe, fully autonomous driving requires real-time data transmission.  Current cellular radio standards such as LTE has a latency of 30 to 40 milliseconds, making it unsafe for driverless vehicles. 5G mobile communication, which will be available for deployment in 2019, will provide higher data rates of up to 10 Gbps with considerably lower latency than LTE, making it suitable for real-time safety applications.
Autonomous Driving Quality  and Reliability Are Non-Negotiable
In addition to being real-time, data sensing and transmission must be 100% reliable. What this means is that connectivity can’t fail because of bad road conditions, such as fog, snow, or ice, or extended use, such as thousands and thousands of hours of operation.
Vehicle manufacturers can achieve this goal by using highly robust automotive-grade connectivity systems, provided by competent and experienced suppliers with engineering and materials science expertise.  OEMs’ preferred suppliers must understand contact physics and the best materials for sound electromechanical connections and have built up the exacting manufacturing processes and tools to build them. 
Increasingly Electrified Cars Will Require a New Approach to Safety
Ensuring data integrity within functional safety applications is mandatory for autonomous driving, because human lives will depend on it. As data requirements grow, cars will increasingly electrify. Thus, it is essential to ensure safe data transport on the physical layer level and provide the highest possible physical and data security protections.
Automotive companies are investigating where and when they can use optical-fiber based connectivity to avoid electromagnetic interference.  Fiber optic communications do not experience electro-magnetic emissions, crosstalk, or signal distortion. This means optical communication network channels can be placed near high-power electric cables and devices and provide reliable functioning without safety concerns or interference worries.
Suppliers are also developing in-vehicle networks based on global automotive Ethernet standards which would carry encrypted data, rather than using proprietary and legacy networks where the data is vulnerable and un-encrypted. Adopting these standards would help prevent cars from being hacked and remotely controlled by a malicious actor.
Next-Generation Car Design Will Require Miniaturized Solutions
To fit V2X systems under the hood of a car, manufacturers will need to develop automotive-grade miniaturized and highly integrated connectivity solutions. Sensors and actuators are getting smaller as links increase.  
The Automotive Ethernet enables manufacturers to deliver both power and data over a single pair of wires, either shielded or unshielded.  TE Connectivity has significant experience in confirming the clearance and creepage margins necessary to accomplish this objective.
At the same time, manufacturers will need to determine and meet pollution and moisture tolerances for systems.  In-vehicle networks will need the lightest and leanest cable assemblies and connectors made yet – which will be placed in ever denser configurations.  TE is helping the automotive industry make these trade-offs and optimize their solutions, to make data traverse systems faster and in the most power-efficient way, but with less total material connector and cabling material.
Co-creating the Future of Mobility
Autonomous driving is changing the way we view vehicles and mobility. Next-generation cars will not just enable transportation: They will also enhance passenger safety, comfort, and entertainment. Imagine reclining in your car as you drive, holding videoconference meetings, sending emails, and finishing a project before you ever arrive at work.
Today, transportation is a necessary, but often painful process. With fully autonomous driving, passengers will be freed to accomplish their own goals, turning the dead hours of driving into fruitful hours of learning, working, engaging, and relaxing.
TE is at the forefront of fully autonomous driving innovation. For decades, we have teamed with automotive manufacturers to collaborate on connectivity solutions that set new industry standards. Today, we continue to collaborate with our customers to adopt the new standards and technology innovations and provide the connectivity that will power a new generation of cars.
TE provides a robust, comprehensive automotive data connectivity product portfolio with solutions that meet manufacturers’ requirements for function, safety, link type, chips, and cable type, as well as industry standards and OEM or Tier1 specifications. Plastic fiber optic solutions include MOST Connectors, which carry data at speeds up to 150Mbps, and a next-generation solution, which will enable data rates of 10 to 24 Gbps.

The need for fleet managers to stay connected to their fleet vehicles is an absolute must. Through installed sensors, managers can receive real-time data on GPS location, fuel consumption, telematics, and more. All of which help to improve their dispatch, route planning, and overall business logistics. Let’s take a look at how IoT solutions are transforming the fleet management industry.
How Does IoT Benefit Fleet Management?
IoT fleet management and asset tracking systems offer many benefits, driving increased efficiencies and better outcomes in several areas. Let’s take a closer look at a few. ‍
Safety
While earlier technology only monitored the vehicle’s location along a route, today’s IoT sensors can deliver much more detailed information to fleet operators. For example, they might monitor tire pressure and coolant temperature and be able to trigger an alert if there’s a problem. 
Access to this type of information gives fleet managers a heads up when a safety risk is detected—and if a part is on the verge of failure, they have time to intervene. In-vehicle sensors also deliver constant, valuable information to drivers, helping them make safer decisions.

‍IoT is likely to play an even bigger role in fleet management than it already has. Fleet managers: take advantage of IoT to stay ahead of your competition.Click To Tweet

Vehicle Maintenance
Similarly, IoT sensors can alert drivers and fleet managers to upcoming maintenance needs such as oil changes and tire rotations. Connected sensors can also be installed in the engine to provide insights about the function of essential parts, allowing companies to initiative preventive maintenance—fixing things before they break down completely.‍
Route Optimization
Advanced GPS systems detect traffic and weather conditions along a vehicle’s route and recommend alternate routes as needed. Fleet-wide, this cuts down on fuel consumption and yields other benefits in saved time and increased safety.‍
Cost Savings
‍IoT fleet management solutions provide companies with layers of useful data, which they can use to increase efficiencies around maintenance, routes, driver accountability, and more. All these optimizations ultimately yield cost savings as the company can run its operations in a much leaner, more effective way.‍
Current Challenges for IoT in Fleet Management
While IoT solutions are very successful in fleet management, adopting many sensors and data streams always presents some challenges. That includes data processing and analytics, system integration, and device management. As a solution, some SIM providers include comprehensive device management services to give you real-time visibility into device health, data limits, and usage.‍
Additionally, there are revolutionary applications of IoT in fleet management. Those applications impact fleet management in a variety of ways from monitoring driver behavior to predictive maintenance to big data analytics.  
Fortunately, there are several successful fleet management examples where companies have successfully implemented IoT solutions at scale:For example, Samsara’s fleet management solution includes GPS tracking and real-time compliance and safety information. Their AI dash cams capture incidents and enhances driver safety. 
The Future of IoT in Fleet Management
‍As we can see, there are major benefits to integrating IoT in fleet management, especially in terms of real-time tracking, monitoring driver behavior, and making data-driven decisions. IoT is likely to play an even bigger role in fleet management with time and has become common in large and small fleet deployments. Our advice for fleet managers: take advantage of IoT to stay ahead of your competition.

Time loss due to traffic jams, rising levels of environmental pollution, an increasing number of fatalities, some of the many woes of urban commuting. Enter smart mobility, a solution based on the use of different modes of transportation instead of one’s personal vehicle. This concept, which runs on the use of carpooling, ridesharing, and bike commuting, has taken cities by storm. Not only that, this market is expected to grow further still though things have been going a little downhill since the advent of the pandemic.
Impact of COVID-19 on the Smart Mobility Market: An Analysis
2020 has been a grim year for all industrial sectors, especially the smart mobility market. The primary reason for the downfall of the smart mobility market can be attributed to a decline in demand for carpooling and ridesharing services across the world, owing to safety concerns.
While it is true that the market is expected to experience even slower growth during 2021, industry experts expect to see the curve rising from the year 2022 onwards. This forecast is based on the belief that adequate safety measures will be introduced for carpooling and ridesharing, such as the placement of plastic barriers between the car’s driver and its passengers.
Factors Affecting the Growth of Smart Mobility
The application of electricity to transportation and the use of carpooling are not novel concepts. In fact, the first Electric Vehicle (EV) was introduced in the US as early as 1889, and by the early 1900s, nearly one-third of the vehicles on the American streets were electricity-powered. It was not until the 1930s that cheap Texas oil made EVs a thing of the past. However, here we stand at the cusp of another golden age wherein EVs and smart mobility are bound to become an essential part of the future.
Having said that, it is natural for one to ask about the significant factors influencing the smart mobility market. The factors may either be drivers or barriers that need to be dealt with the innovation and a common purpose to turn the idea of smart mobility into a living reality.
#1 The Way People Viewed Vehicles are Changing
It was only a few decades back that owning a private car was every family’s dream. Mass production of automobiles and budget-friendly fuel prices brought this ideal within the reach of the average citizen, and as a result, vehicle-centric urban design and personal, door-to-door transportation became the norm.
Today, the scenario is much different. The present millennial-led era prefers not to own a car; instead, this young generation of commuters is shifting in favor of ridesharing services such as Uber or Lyft – they prefer to subscribe to a car-sharing service rather than bear the cost of a personal car, which includes fuel and maintenance costs. Is it any surprise that such new vehicle usage patterns will encourage the growth of the smart mobility market?
#2 Technology is Advancing at a Lightning-Fast Pace
From autonomous vehicles that are smart enough to run on their own to smart parking systems that make the tedious task of parking a piece of cake, technology is the key driver of the smart mobility market. The hyper-connectivity offered by the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G will make it easier for cities to manage traffic, cut down environmental pollution, and make better use of infrastructure. Commuters can have real-time information for smoother and safer transit.
Then, with the use of self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles and drone deliveries, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) predicts that the world may see a whopping 90% reduction in traffic deaths, a 40% reduction in travel time, and a 500% increase in lane capacity. Does it get any smarter than this!
#3 Low Rate of Internet Penetration in Developing Regions
Here’s a barrier to entry for smart mobility systems in full force. Now, the use of ridesharing services requires the involvement of three parties, namely the rider, the driver, and the service provider. The entire process of matching riders with drivers, fare estimation and ride payment are to be carried out via smartphone apps, which in turn require good internet connectivity.
 Unfortunately, some regions, such as Burundi, Chad, and Somalia, among others, have extremely low internet penetration that hinders the development of smart mobility systems in such countries. Once the proper infrastructure for connectivity has been established, the dream of smart mobility can proceed onwards.
#4 An Entirely New Infrastructure and Value Chain is Needed
As much as IoT requires proper infrastructure for connectivity, so does the use of Electric Vehicles require ubiquitous charging infrastructure. The current scenario is pretty awkward wherein potential EV drivers do not see an infrastructure that allows them to buy an EV and drive with confidence, and on the other hand, potential infrastructure providers do not see mass demand insight. Until the time charging stations become as common as gas stations are today, this one barrier-to-entry will make the adoption of EVs a far-fetched dream.
#5 Another Major Driver is Government Policies
Central, state, and city governments can join hands to speed up the adoption of smart mobility systems. Although several US state governments have already directed their focus towards measures such as tax credits and rebates to make smart mobility more affordable for early adopters and are also imposing strict vehicle emission standards for automobile manufacturers, the need of the hour is to offer exclusive EV parking in congested areas, and establishment of ZEZs or Zero Emission Zones wherein traffic will be restricted to bikes, pedestrians, delivery vehicles, and electric vehicles – measures already in place by the city governments of London, Brussels, Paris, and Madrid. Such government policies are sure to accelerate the growth of the smart mobility market.
Top Companies Expected to Dominate the Smart Mobility Market
To create technologically evolved smart mobility solutions, companies need to come up with products that are developed from a long-term market perspective as opposed to short-term creations. This is because as the smart mobility market is set in stone and matures, consumers will naturally demand integrated solutions – a mix of travel services with ancillary services.
As of now, the following companies are expected to take the lead in the future smart mobility market –
CiscoMaaS Global OySiemensTomTom InternationalInnoviz Technologies Inc.Toyota Motor CorporationFord Motor Company, among others.
Despite its present sluggish growth, smart mobility will be a factor in customer preference, changing the way people travel. It’s only a matter of time before this service model comes to the mainstream, and come it will, reaching its projected growth of $70.46 billion by the year 2027.

Tesla (TSLA) is looking at a more-than-decent chunk of a market valued at $1.2 trillion with its upcoming Tesla Network, a new Uber-like ride-hailing service with autonomous electric cars, according to Ark Invest.
For years, Tesla has taunted a ride-hailing app to be powered by its self-driving system. It’s been dubbed the “Tesla Network.”
The new product is dependent on Tesla solving computer vision to deploy its full self-driving system.
In case it does happen, which CEO Elon Musk has been claiming it will this year, investors have been trying to value the extremely disruptive new product.
Ark Invest, a Tesla shareholder, has been trying to put some numbers on the value potential of such a service in its Big Ideas 2021 report.
The group believes that autonomous ride-hailing platforms will generate over $1 trillion in earnings by 2030:


Now the big question is, Who is going to take the bigger share of this insanely large market?
Ark agrees with Musk that Tesla’s vision-based approach is the most scalable one:
Tesla’s approach is camera-based. With less accurate sensors than LiDAR, making the pathto full autonomy a more difficult problem to solve, cameras do not rely on HD maps and should enable a much more scalable service. Tesla’s could be the first autonomous taxi network to scale nationally.
While competitors like Waymo have already launched commercial autonomous ride-hailing services, they believe that the approach is too difficult to scale and will limit the growth:

However, Ark is not as optimistic as Musk when it comes to Tesla launching this service anytime soon. In the report, Ark assigns a 30% probability of Tesla launching its autonomous ride-hailing service in 2022.
But if it does happen, Tesla will take over the market a lot faster:
If Tesla launches its autonomous ride-hailing service successfully in 2022, Ark estimates adoption could approach 20% by 2025. If Waymo or GM is successful, adoption probably will be limited to 1% during the next five years.

The group believes that many are underestimating the impact of autonomous ride hailing, which could undercut human-driven ride hailing by 90% in the US and 50% in China.
Ark estimates a cost of 25 cents per mile for the consumer, which would drastically reduce the cost of personal transportation and expand the market.
Electrek’s Take
In general, I tend to agree.
With every cent per mile that you can shave off the cost of transportation, you drastically increase the market, and autonomous electric vehicles would shave off a few dozen cents per mile.
It will have an extremely disruptive impact on the entire transportation industry.
Most experts currently see Waymo and Cruise as leaders due to their autonomous services are already in operation in San Francisco and Phoenix.
Tesla is not too worried about that because it always believes that its vision-based strategy would enable them to leapfrog those companies who will have a much tougher time expanding the service to other markets. That’s because they require extensive mapping and maintenance of new markets before launching.
But there’s a lot of doubts around Tesla actually solving the vision problem.
 I think Ark’s 30% probability is a safe assumption for now, but that might change after we see Tesla FSD v9 in just a few weeks.

Health care organizations have long struggled with issues related to the shipping and receiving of critical medical supplies. The surge in e-commerce orders, however, has served to exacerbate these problems.

By Kimberly Whitehead and John W. Frazier
Consumers have embraced e-commerce—drawn to the convenience and efficiency of having their purchases delivered right to their doorstep. But the rise in e-commerce has not been beneficial to everyone.
At a health care conference in 2019, a darker and more troubling picture emerged.During a session titled “E-commerce,” complaints arose from almost everyone in the room. “How are we going to get these carriers to understand what they are doing to us?” asked the session speaker. Someone stood and said, “They act like we are not even there. They just drive by my dock.” Another said, “I have the drivers’ cell phone numbers, and I call and beg them to deliver to us first, every day. But it doesn’t always work.” From the back of the room came a booming voice, “I had a patient on the table, but his new heart valve was somewhere in the back of a truck.” He paused, “We had to send the patient home.” A woman in the front of the room said, “Even when they stop, they can’t always find my delivery. There are so many boxes, so many crammed into their trucks. Last week, a driver had to leave and come back later when he found my delivery. By that time, it was too late, the item had expired.” “What are we going to do?” asked the speaker in dismay.
The additional stress on the parcel carriers to deliver more and more packages directly to consumers is well known. The health care materials managers at the conference felt confident that the rise in these e-commerce shipments was contributing to their sense of neglect from their parcel carrier partners and the difficulties they were having efficiently receiving vital deliveries. They told us that they would sometimes have to stand at the back of a truck and look for their package with the driver, searching through piles of boxes that were headed to households.
The comments we heard at the conference led us to investigate if these were isolated incidents or if other health care organizations (HCOs) were experiencing the same problems. Our subsequent research indicates that these managers are, in fact, not alone. Instead, executive interviews and survey responses revealed that last-mile delivery problems are widespread at HCOs across the United States. The results were clear: Health care organizations are on the verge of a logistics crisis, and they need help.
A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT
Health care plays a major role in the U.S. economy. In 2018, health care made up 17.5% of the United States’ gross domestic product (GDP) or $3.6 trillion,1 and logistics expenses for HCOs exceeded 25% of their overall budget.2 Health care logistics itself is a significant portion of the United States’ GDP at approximately 4.4%.
HCO logistics costs are driven in part by the large number, variety, and complexity of stock-keeping units (SKUs) an HCO must manage. The number of SKUs can be over 35,000, and each HCO may store or warehouse up to 8,000 of these items.3 Health care goods include items as diverse as biological agents, food, pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment, and large-scale technology/machinery. Adding to this complexity is the fact that item stockouts may result in a patient fatality or long-term disability.
Considering the burden placed on health care to operate at the lowest possible cost while still providing the best possible services, it is understandable that health care materials managers are looking for help to maximize service and improve efficiencies from their logistics partners. However, while the health care value chain continues to develop and change at a rapid pace, keeping up with medical technology, the intraorganizational health care delivery system has remained largely the same.4 This lack of change is problematic as research has shown that a significant portion of health care managers agree that the management of inbound transportation and delivery needs improvement. A study of challenges facing the health care supply chain found that 62% of HCO materials managers and 56% hospital executives agreed that there is a need for better management of shipping and receiving activities. Likewise, 61% and 58% of the same groups, respectively, agreed that the management of transportation, transfer activities, and delivery also needed improvement.5 Further, studies have also shown that 48% of HCO supply chain costs could be avoided through the implementation of improved logistics processes.6
Research has also found that part of the reason why HCOs are lacking in supply chain mastery and innovation is their dependence on small and partial truckload shipments.7 In more traditional supply chain and manufacturing operations, logistics departments are able to achieve efficiencies through full truck shipments or loop runs. Most HCOs, however, do not have large enough demand to capitalize on full truck load efficiencies. Additionally, HCOs tend to see logistics as transactional versus strategic and therefore do not traditionally invest strategically in technology, staffing, or innovation to optimize logistics. The lack of supply chain mastery causes heightened concern when considering that logistic costs in health care are cited as more than 30% of the total expense of an item versus only 5% in the retail industry.8
Supply chain optimization is also impeded by the fact that supply chain roles at HCOs often focus on contract negotiation and purchasing and pay little to no attention to logistics management.9 As a result of this lack of attention to the external supply chain, HCOs may miss cost reductions and efficiency improvements that may be available. Parcel carriers, for example, can aid in improving expedited deliveries, cold chain deliveries, product security, and inbound freight as well as optimizing the overall network.
On top of these challenges, the growth of e-commerce and omnichannel retail has led to many changes in the supply chain that impact all industries, including HCOs. The number of packages in the parcel carrier system has increased exponentially, placing a strain on the transportation mode that HCOs depend on the most.
BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE SITUATION
To better understand whether there is widespread concern amongst supply chain managers at HCOs about the increased number of consumer shipments due to e-commerce and their potential impact on deliveries to HCOs, we conducted in-depth interviews with managers from four HCOs (see Figure 1) and distributed surveys to 100 health care supply chain professionals throughout the United States.

[Figure 1] Characteristics of interviewed HCOsEnlarge this image
In both the survey and the interviews, we asked HCO supply chain managers about their current concerns, situation, relationships, and needs regarding logistic services. Our questions were designed to learn more about HCO perspectives on the state of shipping/receiving and the role of third parties. The survey results and the interviews helped give us a clearer picture of HCOs’ current challenges with inbound logistics, particularly with regards to types of delivery failures, frequency of delivery failures, shipping/receiving management, and carrier usage and expectations.
An important part of this investigation was to understand what carriers HCOs are using and their expectations of those carriers. With that goal, the survey asked the respondents to rank the following carriers based on how often they use each: Amazon Business, DHL, Federal Express (FedEx), United Parcel Service (UPS), United States Post Office (USPS), and other specialized carriers. A ranking of 1 indicated that the carrier was the HCO’s most often used provider and 6, its least often.
The bar chart in Figure 2 shows the weighted rankings and distribution for each carrier. Weighted rankings use the weighted average of each response in order to give us the ability to see which carrier ranks highest across all responses in terms of usage. For example, FedEx received the majority of rank 1 votes, however, it did not appear as often in the highest ranks of 1, 2, and 3 combined as UPS. Therefore, UPS is identified as the most often used carrier using weighted ranking. Another significant finding here is that Amazon Business is not, in general, seen as a key provider. Although Amazon Business was selected at each rank level, it was most often selected in ranks 4, 5, and 6, or the least often used.

[Figure 2] Carrier weighted rankingsEnlarge this image
The option of “other–specialized carriers” was also selected by the respondents in each rank. The survey allowed the respondents to specify what carriers are used in this category. Seventeen respondents did so, with the answers ranging from eBay and Staples to other major carriers such as SAIA, Teals, and Triose.
The survey also asked respondents to note how often they use health care specialty services such as FedEx Healthcare Solutions, UPS Healthcare and Lifesciences Supply Chain, and DHL Life Sciences and Healthcare. One hundred percent of the respondents said they did not use these specialty services. The reasons offered follow: 45% of the respondents stated that they were not aware of these specialized services, 25% said that these services are cost prohibitive, 23% said that the specialty services do not offer the services that they desire, and 7% offered no reason why the services were not used.
Finally, the survey asked the respondents to rank their desired carrier capabilities with 1 being the most important. Figure 3 shows the weighted values for each of the carrier capabilities. Overnight/expedited deliveries is ranked as the most important of the carrier services followed closely by tracking accuracy and reliability. Compliance and security are ranked similarly and fall in at spots 4 and 5.

[Figure 3] Carrier services weighted rankingsEnlarge this image
DELIVERY FAILURES ARE INCREASING
The main focus of the survey was to assess HCOs’ experiences with delivery failures. The survey asked respondents to note how often they experience delivery failures and if they have seen any changes in the frequency in the last 21 to 24 months. The results are shown in Figure 4. More than half (51%) of respondents noted that they had experienced increases in delayed shipments in the last 12 months and, of those, 71% experienced delays on a daily or weekly basis. A majority (58%) of all respondents—whether they have seen an increase in delays or not—say they experience delayed shipments on a daily or weekly basis. Twenty-eight percent of respondents note that delayed shipments directly affect patient care at least once a week and that their cold-chain shipments experienced delays at the same rate as other items.

[Figure 4] Delivery failure frequency and changes in frequencEnlarge this image
The survey responses reiterated what we heard during the executive interviews. For example, we interviewed the director of supply chain and the materials management contract specialist of an HCO made up of three hospitals with over 600 beds and 60 physicans’ practices. Both executives stated that there has been an increase in delivery delays and that they believe that the increase of consumer packages being delivered by parcel carriers was affecting their organization’s ability to receive timely and accurate deliveries. One executive noted that they have had to help a driver dig through consumer boxes to try and find the hospital’s delivery on more than one occasion.
Two delivery failure examples are described here:
Example 1:An order for tissue allograft was placed on Friday. It was scheduled to be delivered on Monday for use in a surgery on Tuesday. The tissue left the vendor and arrived at the parcel carrier’s distribution hub. When the truck arrived on Monday at 10:30 a.m., the tissue was not on the truck. The biologics distributor tracked the tissue and determined it was still at the carrier’s distribution center. It was discovered that the tissue had been left on the dock over the weekend. Due to oversight, it was not placed on the truck to be delivered to the HCO. This neglect resulted in ruining the temperature-sensitive product; it could no longer be used in surgery, thus delaying the operation.}
Example 2:A surgeon called the distribution center on Friday requesting two products for a surgery on Monday. I could not overnight the products on Saturday for Sunday delivery because the distribution center is closed over the weekend. I had these two products ordered on Sunday to be overnighted and arrive at 9 a.m. on Monday. The truck driver arrived at 9 a.m. at the distribution center and delivered one of the products. The second product was overlooked and remained on the truck. The driver finished the route before realizing that the second product was still on the truck. The driver returned to the distribution center with the second product at 10:30 a.m. However, our truck had already left with product 1 to deliver it to the surgeon. To remedy the situation, I was required to personally deliver product 2 to ensure that the surgery was able to take place as planned.}
TYPES OF DELIVERY FAILURES
Drilling further down, the survey asked respondents what specific types of delivery problems they were facing and how frequently they experienced each of these delivery failures. They were also asked about the impact of these failures from a financial and patient care perspective on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 indicated insignificant and 5 indicated severe impact). From these responses, we developed a weighted ranking indicating which types of delay were the most problematic. Figure 5 shows the weighted rankings for the most common types of delivery failures.

According to the weighted results, the biggest delivery problem that HCOs are facing is delayed receipt. However, delayed or missing data about the delivery, damaged packaging, and damaged items also placed high, receiving almost identical rankings. Incorrect labeling, receiving the wrong item, and having items delivered to the wrong locations were also frequently cited problems.
As Figure 6 shows, each type of failure was ranked as the biggest delivery problem for at least 6% of respondents. This finding shows that each of the delivery failures listed are being experienced on a broad scale through the health care industry.

[Figure 6] What is your top delivery problem?Enlarge this image
For example, one HCO, consisting of a hospital with 385 beds, 35 physicians’ offices, and an outpatient surgery did not have the same problems with delayed receipt as its counterparts. While it had received late and missing deliveries from time to time, its most significant issues pertained to labeling, according to the director of supply chain management. Shipments were being received at the HCO’s warehouse without specific labels indicating the final destination within the organization. This lack of labeling delays the final delivery of the product to the end user. “Carriers deny that labeling is their responsibility, however, they should screen packages to confirm that they have the appropriate identifying information,” the director said. “This is a lack of communication between the HCO and the carrier.”
THE EFFECT OF E-COMMERCE
The survey also asked the respondents to discuss any trends that they were seeing in shipping/delivery problems. This was an open-ended question that allowed the respondents to reply with their own words. The responses were examined for repeated concepts and ideas. Problems cited in the open-ended answers included: backorders (8% of all answers); shipping is generally slowing down (11%); drivers are overloaded, overworked, or lazy (15%); and the system is overwhelmed (10%). Some shared that they are experiencing the effects of driver fatigue such as throwing packages and rushing.
Notably, no one mentioned e-commerce as a potential contributor to these problems. However, when asked whether or not consumer e-commerce shipping was negatively affecting their deliveries, 41% said yes. Some respondents again commented that the system was “overwhelmed,” while others discussed the lack of capacity at the carriers. Some noted that the problem is worse during the holidays.
In particular, some HCOs are seeing the increase in consumer package deliveries as affecting their ability to receive orders efficiently and effectively. We interviewed the director of materials management at one HCO who said the “glut” of packages from consumer-based e-commerce has affected the strict time requirements for parcel carriers. This rush has caused drivers to not give their employees the time necessary to fully audit deliveries before giving their signature of receipt.
This HCO has 1,500 beds in nine hospitals with over 300 additional offices and facilities. Due to the size of this HCO, it receives large volumes of products and packages each day. The interviewee noted that the HCO does not experience significant delays in shipments because of its size and the volume of packages to be delivered. However, the numerous packages and shipments received throughout the day do cause a delay in receiving. Because of time pressures from the carriers, the employees only check to ensure that they received the proper number of packages; they are not checking if everything on the packing slip has been received and is undamaged. When there are errors, the carrier relies on the receiving signature to determine if all items were delivered correctly. However, many times these signatures were made without a full audit of the shipment. The HCO incurs additional costs when resolving these types of issues. An example of this type of situation is described by the director as follows:
Two expensive pieces of equipment should have been among the typical 150 package shipment. When it was discovered that the pieces were not delivered, a long process of searching for the product ensued. The HCO ultimately had to replace the items at its own expense.
It is important to note that not all HCOs are experiencing delivery problems. For example, the materials management manager at a small critical access hospital with only 25 beds said that they do not have notable issues with shipment receipts from carriers. This HCO, however, belongs to a group purchasing organization (GPO) and its membership includes a national contract with a major carrier. When they experience issues with their carrier, the HCO refers those shipping issues to the GPO for resolution. The manager shared that, “…being a member of the managing organization negates many of the problems that other HCOs face.” The manager attributed the size of the organization as the reason why the organization was able to manage their shipments well.
HOW TO IMPROVE?The survey responses and executive interviews both support the need for improvements in health care logistic services. Most notably the following suggestions or improvements were raised on multiple occasions and are supported by the data:
Increase parcel carrier training regarding issues unique to HCOs.Create and implement universal specialized labeling for all HCO packages for ease of recognition.Increase communication, either direct or indirect, between HCOs and their parcel carriers.Improve the methods used to differentiate between consumer packages and business-to-business packages.
The respondents took time to include comments at the end of the survey. Most notably they emphasized the importance of delivery outcomes such as on-time deliveries, on-time data receipt, undamaged packages, no missing packages, correct delivery location, and correct labeling. The survey respondents repeatedly commented that delivery outcomes can affect the finances of their HCOs but more often stated that delivery outcomes affect the efficiencies of their organizations and, ultimately, became a part of patient care itself.

This study suggests that delivery problems are not unique to individual HCOs. Rather, these problems are universal and are being experienced on a widespread basis. Logistics and delivery is an area where HCOs could work together directly or through professional organizations in an effort to improve their communication and collaboration with key parcel carriers.
Discussing these problems with the parcel carriers in an open forum, perhaps on a national level, would lead to more transparency between HCOs and these service providers. These types of discussions would allow HCO supply chain managers to voice their concerns as they did in this survey. This could be an opportunity for managers to ask for driver training, to find economical ways to prioritize HCO shipments, and to ask for new ways to label HCO shipments. It could also be an opportunity for carriers to better understand the frustrations, concerns, and needs of their HCO partners in the last-mile health care supply chain

BlackBerry had its annual analyst event last week where its CEO John Chen explained something I thought was very provocative about the future the company anticipates.
It has to do with far broader interoperability, unique dependencies, and a level of potential security risk that most other technology firms aren’t yet considering. What if our coming wave of autonomous vehicles can connect to any IoT device?
Our Frightening Autonomous IoT Future
I could have titled this our fascinating, exciting, or unforgettable autonomous IoT future but, other than BlackBerry, no one seems to be focused on the security problems that this future will bring with it. We are creating an ecosystem where cars and robots are autonomous and connected so they will be able to connect to other devices, sensors, and data repositories available to them.
Companies like Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm have been talking about the massive amount of training, sensors, and AI technology going into cars and the C-V2X capability for these vehicles to communicate with each other and the smart city ecosystems they will be traveling.
Capabilities like using other car sensors to identify threats they can’t yet see are standard in demonstrations. But what about all the cameras popping up around the car? Cars will have layers of sensors from LiDAR (light detection and ranging) to cameras (including infrared) that will be able to see better than you can in all kinds of weather situations; and they’ll be fully trained on how to deal with anything they see.
But smart cities will have their cameras, sensors, and huge data lakes of information that cars could also use to see things out of their range.
For instance, if a child runs toward the street, the car cameras might not see them yet, but the security camera on the house, store, or office building might. Cars routed to pass down that street would, if they connected to that camera, get an alert that a hazard was about to enter the street that should be avoided. They might even get identifying information that would determine if that hazard is a child, dog, cat, or object in motion; and from that information the car could better anticipate and avoid hitting it.
Let’s extend this to where street sensors could report ice or water on the road, which could pose a danger depending on how fast the car is going and what type of tires are on the vehicle. Gunshot sensors could warn cars away from dangerous areas. Historical crime data could also help guide vehicles around areas where carjackings and other forms of crime, particularly dangerous to passengers, make travel unacceptably dangerous.
Now imagine if some hostile actor was able to take control of any number of these sensors. They could force the car into unsafe areas, they could cause the car to slow, and rather than avoid a carjacker serve itself up to one. Instead of sending the car a safe route, they could provide it with a very unsafe direction.
BlackBerry’s Solution
What John Chen seemed to be talking about was a future solution from BlackBerry that would establish a zero trust network for these devices and the autonomous vehicles, robots, drones, and other things that make use of the data.
This zero trust environment would provide a comprehensive way to secure IoT devices, secure the data coming from them (both in-transit and at rest) and aggressively protect the autonomous things using that data from being compromised by malware.
While we are likely at least five years from all of this coming together. The effort to secure this autonomous/IoT solution is arguably more important than the effort to create it. We are anticipating a substantial reduction in automobile-related deaths once autonomous driving becomes viable.
But suppose those vehicles and the data they use aren’t secured. In that case, we could see an expansion of the Tesla crashes thus far caused by poor driver decisions to use a technology that isn’t ready for autonomous driving.
The Danger of Mixed Messages
Right now, autonomous driving isn’t that popular. Concerns about the technology indicate that adaption will lag optimums significantly over the next decade or so because people don’t trust the tech. We saw during the pandemic that mixed messages from the CDC on masks, and concerns about blood clots, which are incredibly infrequent, are causing people to distrust the vaccines.
The significant number of drivers that have died in Teslas while allegedly using autopilot has grown substantially, and each crash seems to get front-page coverage. These crashes are mainly being caused by Tesla drivers who think they have an autopilot. Still, that capability won’t arrive until we have Level 4 or 5 autonomous systems. Tesla cars currently range from Level 2 to 2+, and they lag Cadillac in terms of the system’s performance while calling it Autopilot.
Since I was a kid, we’ve told the story of the first significant cruise control accident and how it was caused by someone who didn’t know what cruise control was, renting an RV, and being told it was like an autopilot. So he set the cruise control, went back to make some coffee, and ended up in a massive crash. Elon Mush either never heard that story or has some weird desire to see how many people he can get to crash their cars by using the same method.
In much the same way that the CDC mixed messages and blood clot reports adversely impact the vaccine rollout, these crashes are scaring people away from autonomous cars before they are even ready.
The same as we need a critical mass of people vaccinated so we can get to herd immunity, we need a critical mass of people using autonomous cars; so we can reduce the 38,000 people who are killed, and the 4.4 million who are injured seriously enough to require medical attention in car accidents each year on U.S. roadways to numbers far closer to zero.
If you buy an autonomous car, it will make you safer. But if a critical mass of people buy the technology, assuming it works, only then do cars because genuinely safe. I often wonder if Elon Musk has some self-destructive condition — or doesn’t like people — because there is no reason to call a technology Autopilot before Level 4 autonomous driving is reached.
Consumer Reports has been trying to get him to change the name of this feature until it can do what the name implies, but he hasn’t. Check out this video for more about that:
A couple of weeks ago, two more people allegedly died as a result. Tesla disputes the cause. Nonetheless, Tesla death numbers are very troubling given the car is built like a tank.
People who drive a Tesla are often the upper class which includes politicians. Both the EU and the U.S. have handed out fines in the billions to tech companies in the past. I wish Musk would stop using the name Autopilot to save lives. But even if he stopped only to avoid a huge fine, I expect the result would be beneficial to Tesla drivers, the Tesla company, and the future of autonomous driving.
Wrapping Up
Autonomous cars and the related robots and drones coming out of applied AI promise to transform the world into something pretty amazing. Companies like Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm are working furiously to create an extraordinary level of technology that will keep us safer and massively reduce the significant number of people killed or crippled in car accidents. Each has elements of security surrounding their efforts.
Still, it may be BlackBerry’s focus on security — the environment that these autonomous, connected things operate in — that will provide the most significant level of protection.
But these companies and their efforts will have reduced success if Elon Musk doesn’t stop referring to his offerings as having autonomous driving capabilities that are greater than the car is capable of providing yet. Overpromising and underdelivering on a technology that can save or take lives is incredibly foolish and damaging to the overall effort.
If the government begins hitting Tesla and Musk with huge fines, or people, over time, connect the Telsa brand to death, it won’t bode well for Tesla. There is no upside to implying you have autonomous driving before you have it. It just gets people killed.
When autonomous driving truly arrives, it could be excellent. But only if people trust it enough to implement it in numbers significant enough to reach critical mass — and only if the entire ecosystem that the vehicles operate in is secure and capable of doing the job. We aren’t there yet — and Musk, one of the leading pioneers of technology, is making things worse, not better.
If we want the better future that autonomous cars promise, everyone on the critical path to success needs to be on the same page. That isn’t the case yet, which will push adoption out farther than it needs to be.

Led by former engineers from Tesla and Faraday Future, Hemant Sikaria and Mayank Sikaria, Sibros is an automotive technology company offering a next-generation vehicle-to-cloud automotive software platform. 
CEO and co-founder Hemant Sikaria had the light bulb moment to start Sibros when he had to make multiple trips to his car dealer due to a software recall. Upon further research, he realised the majority of OEMs did not have the necessary capabilities for advanced full vehicle updates. In fact, global OEMs have been facing significant software and data complexity challenges as vehicles were increasingly shifting towards electrification and self-driving modes. 
Synergising Hemant’s experience at Tesla in building systems that could solve these problems with Over-the-Air (OTA) programming, and Mayanks’s significant contributions to the software, data and battery management systems at Faraday, the duo teamed up to form Sibros.
Analytics India Magazine got in touch with the founders to understand how Sibros is leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to help automakers build new connectivity use cases and business models.
Leading The Way With ML
The advancement in 5G technology along with software-defined vehicles has allowed Over-the-Air software updates to extend beyond just telematics and head unit applications. As a matter of fact, the connected car revolution has made OTA software an industry standard for automakers. For the uninitiated, OTA can reduce consequential software recalls to create new revenue opportunities, and enhance the customer experience by shortening the time required to update, fix, and maintain vehicles throughout their entire lifecycle.
Sibros’ flagship product, OTA Deep Updater executes full vehicle Over-the-Air (OTA) software updates while logging vital vehicle data in real-time from every sensor and microchip. The solution supports any vehicle platform, architecture and hardware, starting from two to four wheelers, commercial trucks/busses to electric, and internal combustion to hybrid vehicles. 
Explaining the process, Hemant stated: Sibros collects data at the edge that is processed with machine learning and artificial intelligence to help automakers build new connectivity use cases, and business models, like variable insurance, driver personalisation, fixing software recalls overnight, crash detection, etc.
With its modular system that provides full vehicle OTA updates to every sensor or engine control unit (ECU) while logging real-time vehicle data, Sibros’ deep connectivity platform really stands out in the market. “As modern vehicles can produce petabytes of data monthly, Sibros selectively capture the most meaningful data based on customisable events and triggers. This data is then further compressed and uploaded to the cloud backend,” explained Hemant. “This method enables efficient cloud computing throughput and enables OEMs to leverage live vehicle data for fleet/service management, developing new connected apps, building third party marketplaces and much more.” 
The company uses machine learning, data pipelines and IoT to abstract, process and interpret vehicle data, such as fault codes, into human-readable formats on visual dashboards. “Our efforts on the AI and analytics front are all geared towards improving capabilities around safety measurement, failure detection and preventative maintenance,” said Mayank. “We offer insights into driving behaviour of each user on the platform by combining vehicle data such as speed or harsh acceleration and braking with external data sources like traffic, data and time.”
Sibros OTA Deep Updater can also automatically detect vehicle movement risks by flagging abnormalities in a vehicle’s manoeuvring patterns. Component usage like blending weather, altitude and region information, battery health, and performance also play a crucial role in providing insights to automakers for determining the optimal configuration of a battery in different markets.
Sibros’ core technology stack leverages Golang as the primary backend language to handle high currency workloads, with an outstanding balance between performance and developer velocity. However, for the frontend, the company leveraged React.js and React Native to deliver the product to multiple platforms without having to rewrite the stack from scratch. “We also heavily leverage cloud-native solutions including SQL/No-SQL and Kubernetes for container orchestration to avoid reinventing the wheel, and build our infrastructure as code using Terraform,” said Mayank.
COVID Impact
“While initially, the COVID pandemic has ground the automotive industry to a halt, slowing the progress with plants shutting down, the things have now started to pick up slowly, and we see a tremendous uptick in business traction,” said Hemant. SEE ALSO
As remote working and contactless interactions are becoming the new norm, Sibros was able to deliver an embedded software and cloud/analytics solution remotely. The solution is also enabling field technicians not to be physically present while performing R&D and testing the beta vehicles. “As our solution is designed to enable fully Over-the-Air remote services, this ultimately benefits end customers to limit their exposure for visiting a dealer for servicing or utilising new connected services, such as in-vehicle payments for goods/food/tolling/parking,” added Hemant.
Despite COVID, Sibros has been able to build a diverse and inclusive work culture. The employees can work directly with clients in their initial months to see their ideas become a reality in their product roadmap and offerings. “Our current and future job requisitions span the gamut — from embedded firmware engineers and full-stack engineers to UI/UX, sales and marketing. We look for people who are coachable and rising stars, instead of necessarily looking for specific skill sets,” said Hemant.
Wrapping up
Sibros currently has presence in multiple locations and is engaged with the largest Indian OEMs of two, three, and four wheeler vehicles. The founders believe that India is a high growth area for Sibros in terms of talent acquisition and building a customer base. The country holds great promise for the future of major automotive trends, particularly in areas of rapid charging infrastructure and EV production/adoption, they said.
The company has grown to over 40 employees and has raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by Nexus Venture Partners. “Our customer base includes the vehicle manufacturers directly spanning some of the world’s largest funded EV startups to some of the biggest makers of two and four-wheeler vehicles,” added Hemant.
Speaking about the company’s five-year plans, Hemant said Sibros intends to enter other verticals where the technology can be applied with minimal changes. “We also plan to stand up a centre of excellence in Pune as well as expanding our presence in Germany, Japan and China. Our vision is that in five years, the connected vehicle ecosystem will become a mainstream reality, powered by Sibros. Much like smartphone ecosystems gave birth to disruptive services and apps such as Uber or Airbnb, so will the vehicle ecosystem. It’s moving rapidly, and we expect to gain much progress over the next five years to accomplish this vision,” he added.

It looks like a race is shaping up to determine the future management of General Motors’ credit card business. This week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman Sachs is aggressively pushing to acquire the GM card, arguing that it’s the best company to usher GM into an era of commerce where cars will be the next great connected portal.
However, the Journal cited unnamed sources as saying that the London-based Barclays is also bidding for GM’s card business, while current issuer Capital One is unlikely to let the account go without a fight.
The GM card has about $3 billion in outstanding balances, making it an attractive target. But the Journal said that Goldman and Barclays aren’t as interested in what the card is today so much as what it has the potential to become in a future world of connected cars.
As GM cars are fitted with various smart features into their dashboards, consumers could use the card to connect with businesses directly from their vehicles. Drivers could easily pay for gas or groceries, book hotel rooms or order takeout food with a simple voice command or tap of a dashboard button.
For Goldman, a deal for GM’s credit card business would come as the investment bank is already pursuing a high-stakes plan to transform itself into a wider-ranging, consumer-focused financial services company, according to the Journal.
Goldman has already been pushing into consumer credit, most notably with its 2019 team-up with Apple on the Apple Card. The firm has also spent years expanding Marcus, its online banking service that began offering savings accounts and personal loans in 2016.
And while Goldman and Barclays are making news for their potential pursuit of GM’s card and car-connected commerce, they’re just the latest entrants in the race.
Ned Curic, vice president of Alexa Auto, told CNBC late last year that demand from the auto sector for voice-activated technology was “through the roof.”
“Two-and-a-half years ago, we had nothing,” he said last December. “We’re much further than I thought we would be. I’m quite pleased with the speed we were able to build and deploy.” 
Amazon is looking to jump on drivers’ increased desire for connectivity in cars, aiming to develop a smooth exchange between Alexa at home and in automobiles. At the same time, automakers are working to improve the quality of voice recognition in cars. 
Ten automakers had already signed on with Amazon as of early this year, with more expected to do so by the end of 2020. Arianne Walker, Amazon’s chief evangelist for Alexa Auto, told CNBC that Amazon was “essentially talking” with all major automakers about partnering in some form.
“It’s really more a matter of getting things lined up for the cars that are going to be released as opposed to any hesitation,” she told the network. 
Meanwhile, this week also saw Google’s GPS navigation app, Waze, roll out contactless payments for its 130 million U.S. active monthly users. With the new launch, drivers who pull into participating stations will get a notification on Waze prompting their Android or iOS device to securely pay through each company’s app.
“Waze is committed to continuing to help businesses leverage innovative technology to adapt, evolve and engage with customers,” Andrew Kandel, Waze U.S. country manager, said in a statement.
And it’s not just Big Tech firms hoping to jump into the automotive commerce experience. Dan Gittleman, CEO at automotive software supplier Xevo, told Karen Webster in a late 2019 interview that the auto industry’s original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) also want in on the potential commerce action. While Amazon, Google, Apple and others may want to control connected commerce transactions themselves, as the technology is embedded into the car’s infotainment system, that might not be the deal they’re offered.
“It doesn’t have to work that way,” Gittleman said. It will be up to the OEMs to negotiate the best deals they can with Amazon, Google and others in terms of the technology that will play a big role in connected vehicles.
Companies are racing to get into the connected car economy because of its lucrative potential. PYMNTS’ Digital Drive Report found that connected car commerce represents a $230 billion opportunity.
What are U.S. consumers doing with existing connected car technology, like smartphones plugged into the dashboard?
According to our data, 47 percent look for gas stations, followed by 35 percent who are ordering food for pick up at the drive-through and 33 percent who buy coffee for drive-through pick up. Smaller percentages use technology to order groceries or other items for pick up in the store.
Of course, consumers are spending less time in their cars than they did when we conducted our survey, as more of them are working from home. But Americans were already demonstrating in the pre-pandemic era that they were getting comfortable using their cars as commerce command centers.
It seems likely that those same customers – whose lives have generally become highly digitized because of COVID-19 – will be even more ready to turn their cars into digital shopping centers when they’re back on the road.
That means the race to “own” connected car commerce will likely carry on beyond Goldman, Barclays and Capital One’s battle for the rights to issue GM cards. After all, the reward at the end of the connected car tunnel looks like it will be too big to ignore.

Innovation is at the forefront of smart and sustainable mobility development. An Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) can meet the urban mobility challenges head-on. Cities can reinvent their transit networks using ICTs and IoT-enabled platforms to build smart mobility systems that offer creative, tech-driven solutions for different mobility operations, including traffic management, parking management, etc. Let’s find out which cities have the smartest transport.
ITS systems have already optimized several city transit networks through a technical and organizational overhaul. But, in particular, the following four cities have witnessed an incredible smart mobility transformation.
1. Barcelona, Spain
First up on the list is Barcelona! This city has often emerged as the world’s smart mobility leader, thanks to the wide-scale implementation of IoT systems in the city’s transportation infrastructure. Every street in Barcelona has LED-based streetlights connected to a network of sensors.
These sensors can measure temperature, pollution, foot traffic, etc. to adapt to dynamic traffic needs and cut down on energy usage during off-peak hours. This network of smart streetlights complements the city’s intelligent traffic light network that provides special “green light,”traffic-less routes for emergency services like ambulance, fire trucks, etc.
In Barcelona, smart car parks are the bedrock of the city’s mobility sector, generating a revenue of 36.5 million Euros annually. The city’s smart parking system uses wireless sensors embedded beneath the roads to guide drivers to vacant parking spots via Smartphone apps, saving both time and fuel lost to cruising. And parking facilities charge demand-based tariffs for enhanced revenue generation.
Furthermore, Barcelona’s enviable bus transit system is the smartest in the world. The city’s bus network uses an orthogonal grid scheme to promote intermodality i.e., combining different modes of smartest transport for seamless mobility. Every bus stop placed strategically to provide a connection between bus lines, tram lines, bicycle lanes, metro lines, etc. These bus stops are equipped with interactive touch screens that run on solar energy to display bus arrival timings.
2. Vienna, Austria
Renowned for its imperial sites, cozy café houses, and wine taverns, the city’s smart transit system also adds to the Viennese charm. Vienna relies on multimodal and cooperative systems to deliver seamless citywide connections. While cycling and walking are encouraged here, residents can also leverage a transparent bike-sharing network, pedestrian zones, and dedicated travel lanes to curb carbon emissions and road congestion. No wonder, Vienna has been leading the “quality of life” index since 2008.
Meanwhile, significant investments in public transits engineer Vienna’s drive to lower Motorized Individual Traffic (MIT) in the city – by 2025, it aims to decrease the MIT amount by 20%. Vienna’s enviable public transport network sprawls the entire city with five underground metro lines, 29 tramway lines, and 127 bus lines.
City’s metro system transports 1.3 million commuters every day while most of the city’s population lives within 300m or less from several public transits. Most of these services are easily navigable through the Smartphone app called ‘Quando.’ Commuters get updates about the next subway train, bus departures, and tram routes for easy travel route mapping.
In the city’s goal to become more “livable,” advanced technical provisions in public transits are available to those with special needs. They can use multi-sensor guidance systems, custom-designed route planners for hassle-free commutes. Thanks to such technology-enabled features, Vienna boasts of the smartest transport network.
3. Tokyo, Japan                
Tokyo is home to over 10 million people, yet moving around the city is remarkably simple and easy. The city hosts efficient, IoT-enabled railway lines and bullet trains that can go up to 600 Km per hour for faster citywide trips; Tokyo’s Yamanote Line, a loop line that runs around the metropolitan’s center, can speedily transport 34 million passengers per week.
Payment for public transits is secure, thanks to IC cards. An IC card is a prepaid, rechargeable card that can be used to pay fares on public transports and at several shops, restaurants, convenience stores, and vending machines. Pasmo and Suico are the IC cards for Tokyo’s railway, bus, and subway users. Easy to top up, these smart cards are incredibly convenient for traveling around the city.
Japan’s public transportation systems, primarily its railway system, operates using smart IoT technology. The public transit systems undergo a “condition-based maintenance” wherein data is collected and analyzed to check equipment status. Based on the intelligence received, railway operators identify weaknesses, schedule repairs, or predict operational issues to reduce the number of maintenance closures.
To facilitate smart applications for public use, Tokyo uses an open public platform called Cpass.io that connects the IoT devices, several sources of big data, and government data together. A Cpass allows Tokyo’s local government and other government bodies to share data with the public and other businesses. The data shared includes the number of vehicles in the city, accidents, traffic flow, etc. to encourage technological applications for public use.
4. London, United Kingdom
In London, 2 million people ride the “Tube” every single day. Being one of the world’s oldest and busiest subway systems, the London Tube meets its maintenance and operational needs via smart mobility solutions. The Tube’s sprawling matrix uses network-enabled sensors embedded in CCTV cameras, PA loudspeakers, subway tunnels, etc. that help collect operational data.
Then, central control centers use the accumulated data to monitor equipment issues and deploy maintenance teams to make quick repairs and avert maintenance-based delays. Additionally, Transport for London (TFL) – Greater London’s local body responsible for transportation – provides free Wi-Fi on the underground networks to track user’s journeys from start to finish and analyses collected data to improve the efficiency of the subway system.
Furthermore, London developed a Heathrow Pod system to handle the road congestion caused by heavy traffic flow at the city’s Heathrow airport. It is a zero-emission, rapid transit system that uses Heathrow Pods (a fleet of automated, driverless electronic vehicles) to transport customers between airport terminal 5 and the business car park in just 5 minutes. The system consists of 21 public pods in total, eliminating the need for bus travel.
What tops all this is that most of London’s smart mobility projects are user-friendly. For instance, London initiated the “Transport for London Platform” that allows people to plan their journeys through multi-modal smart mobility options online. Users can book a trip in the cable car, rent a bike, navigate travel routes, etc. on said platform, facilitating smoother trips around the city.
The Need of the Hour
The Smartest transport solutions are necessary for curbing the cities’ mobility challenges. Besides, new, innovative, and data-driven intelligent mobility solutions can accrue long-term economic and environmental value to municipalities, policymakers, businesses, and, most of all, to travelers. After all, the primary objective of the smartest transport system is to enhance city life quality.

 The startup is set to begin production in 2022, with United Airlines as one of its first customers. 
 By  Chris YoungJun 11, 2021   
A California-based startup called Archer Aviation unveiled a “fully autonomous” electrical vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxi called Maker during a live event on June 11, with first flights planned for later this year, the company explained in a press statement.
The Maker aircraft is a prototype, which Archer will use to perform tests in order to gain certification. The company hopes to eventually build a larger production eVTOL aircraft for commercial intracity transportation.
Much like Volocopter’s recently revealed VoloConnect aircraft, the Maker launches using vertical facing rotors before transitioning to fixed-wing flight like that of a plane, reaching speeds up to 150 mph (240 km/h).
The 3,300-lb (1496 kg) craft features a 40-foot (12.2 m) wingspan on which 12 rotors are placed, in a design typical of other eVTOL prototypes.
The difference here, according to a report by CNET, is that the aircraft uses six large, five-bladed props that provide most of the lift, as well as six smaller, two-blade rotors that are only used when the aircraft is hovering and cruising.
By combining the larger rotors with smaller ones with a lower “tip speed,” Archer said its aircraft is 100 times quieter than a traditional helicopter, making it ideal for urban spaces. To be precise, the Maker hums at around 45 decibels (dB) when cruising at around 2,000 feet — an average helicopter would typically let off approximately 87 dB of sound.
First commercial flight could be as early as 2024
The Maker utilizes six independent battery packs, each with a capacity of 75 kWh, and it can rapidly recharge its batteries in just 10 minutes.
Though Archer Aviation said Maker will be “fully autonomous,” it will have a human pilot for safety purposes, as well as space for four passengers.

Archer Aviation envisions one of its aircraft’s services as shuttling VIP passengers from airports to city center in a short amount of time — it could get from San Francisco Airport to San Jose in only 17 minutes, for example.
Archer expects to complete its first Maker test flight during Q4 of this year. United Airlines has already announced plans to buy $1 billion worth of the company’s upcoming air taxi, in a bid to reduce its carbon footprint. The first commercial flights could launch in 2024 in Los Angeles and Miami — a little after Volocopter aims to launch its own air taxis in Paris and Singapore.

Drivers could also buy longer range, more performance, or entertainment while charging
 By JIL MCINTOSH   
Volkswagen has been working on self-driving electric vehicles for a while, but now there’s a new twist: The company may let you sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride after you’ve paid for a monthly subscription.
Thomas Ulbrich, a member of Volkswagen’s board, told the German newspaper Die Welt that subscription features will start showing up in the second quarter of 2022 on vehicles in the company’s ID line of all-electric vehicles. He suggested autonomous driving, when it’s finally available, would be priced at €7 per hour – just over 10 Canadian loonies, although there’s no word when such a service might start up over here.
Ulbrich also mentioned possible subscriptions for increases to EV range or performance, or for entertainment features, such as video games, to pass the time while waiting for the vehicle to recharge. 
Zellmer, Volkswagen’s chief sales officer, implied that by offering a subscription for services when they’re finally available, drivers could opt for a lesser-priced vehicle now and then spend a small hourly amount in future when they want to be autonomously driven, rather than pay much more now for a vehicle with the self-driving feature built into the price, but not yet fully operational — an obvious swipe at Tesla.
But if buying a few hours of your vehicle’s self-driving ability keeps your prices down, it’ll still add up to what could potentially be vast millions of euros for Volkswagen. According to Die Welt, the German automaker will offer several digital services to ID drivers, as it transitions from simply a carmaker into a mobility provider.
Volkswagen’s software development subsidiary, originally called Car.Software Organisation and since renamed Cariad, created a cloud-based automated driving platform working with Microsoft, and purchased a camera software business from Hella. The company said about 10 per cent of the Volkswagen Group’s software code is written in-house, but plans are to increase software development to 60 per cent internally by 2025.
Volkswagen certainly isn’t alone in exploring subscription-based features as a way of increasing revenue. In the past, Tesla charged owners to “unlock” the highest performance in some Model S cars, while BMW briefly charged owners in the past to access Apple CarPlay, and has mulled over the idea of subscriptions to keep features such as heated seats or adaptive cruise control operative once a trial period runs out.

Transportation management systems are key to managing Supply chain disruptions, shifting capacity, fluctuating fuel costs and demanding e-commerce customer requirements.
Most of us recall store shelves emptied of cleaning and paper products in the early days of the pandemic. While many shortages were steadily corrected, the supply and demand imbalance “brought transportation to the board room, and not for the right reasons,” says Shane Duncan, vice president of shipper solutions with freight marketplace Transfix. To address transportation challenges, shippers need to be able to pivot when issues arise.
A transportation management system (TMS) can help by bringing “structure to chaos,” Duncan says. For instance, a TMS might deploy dynamic routing guides that adjust with the market, providing flexibility and additional capacity when needed.
What exactly is a TMS? It’s a platform that uses technology to help businesses plan, execute, and optimize the movement of goods, says Daniela Hendricks, chief compliance and process officer with logistics provider Gebrüder Weiss. A TMS also can ensure shipments comply with regulations and include required documentation.
Current TMS solutions offer more capabilities than those of even a few years ago. For instance, today’s rating engines are expected to include multiple transportation modes, and TMS platforms’ increasing need to integrate with a range of other parties, including carriers and brokerages, says Jeff Lokant, director of technology operations with logistics management company Transportation Insight.
DRIVING INTEREST
Several shifts in the business world have boosted interest in TMS solutions. The pandemic highlighted both the volatility and importance of the transportation function. Many TMS platforms can provide routing optimization, visibility, traceability, and other capabilities that businesses need to compete in a post-pandemic landscape, says Sebastian Valencia, partner with Clarkston Consulting.
The shift to cloud-based TMS solutions is accelerating the “democratization of TMS,” says Bart De Muynck, vice president and analyst with research firm Gartner. By providing automation and a single source of information with a nominal upfront investment, these solutions can offer value to even small shippers.
Like smartphones, TMS solutions also are becoming more open, says Fab Brasca, global vice president, global solutions with Blue Yonder. Their value comes not just from the solution itself, but from the “ecosystem” of applications they work with. Say a TMS provides coverage for road, but not ocean shipments. Increasingly, TMS solutions can connect with other providers to offer the capabilities they lack.
A TMS’s ability to eliminate paper files, while also storing and sharing shipment information electronically, has also become “a must in any TMS software during this pandemic,” Hendricks says.
Newer TMS solutions are built on “microservice architecture” that allows for easier integrations with other solutions through application programming interfaces (APIs). “It’s like the old Burger King model: ‘Have it your way,'” Lokant says, and select from more choices when integrating with other applications.
CONSIDERING A TMS
Given the democratization of TMS solutions, do they make sense for all organizations, big and small? “Size isn’t the key determining factor,” Valencia says. More relevant are the importance of managing transportation costs and/or meeting customer expectations. If these run high, even many small companies can justify investments in TMS solutions.
Also consider the ability of a TMS to enhance decision-making through improved intelligence, such as figuring out the best way to move 1,000 different products. A TMS also makes sense when manual processes have become bottlenecked and inefficient.
Before evaluating a specific TMS solution, here’s some advice:
Review your own operations. Consider your size and organizational structure, industry, the modes of transportation you use, and the degree to which you operate internationally, De Muynck advises. Say you move only domestic over-the-road shipments. A cloud solution geared to small operations may suffice.
Understand the pricing model to avoid surprises. Some TMS solutions charge per module and some per transaction.
Assess the software’s user-friendliness. “A TMS should be intuitive and allow the user to get rates and create shipments fairly easily,” says Kate Leatherbury, director of domestic transportation solutions with Gebrüder Weiss. To boost operational efficiency, the TMS should facilitate connectivity with other operating systems, as well as business partners.
Evaluate the TMS’s ability to accurately represent network constraints. For instance, North America is home to many mammoth distribution centers, so it’s easy to take dock capacity for granted, Brasca notes. Distribution facilities tend to be smaller in some other parts of the world. A solution has to recognize the constraints to accurately plan capacity. It also should be able to distinguish between, for example, the time required to load trucks with pallets versus boxes.
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT
Even as TMS solutions continue to advance and offer value to a broader range of organizations, there’s still room for improvement. It’s hard to find a single application that can cover all services with the depth most organizations need, in all regions of the world, Valencia says. Shippers often patch together multiple solutions to get all the capabilities they need.
Acquisitions are helping some companies incorporate more capabilities within a single platform. One example is MercuryGate’s recent acquisition of Cheetah Software. In its announcement, MercuryGate indicated the acquisition extends its platform to include last-mile, parcel, and LTL capabilities, among others.
LOOKING AHEAD
TMS solutions of the future will increasingly incorporate technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). “AI is not just a buzzword,” Lokant notes.
For the moment, however, the industry resides in “AI 1.0,” and many companies need more mature underlying data sets before AI solutions can “enrich a mainstream value proposition,” he says.
In another shift, a broader approach to problem-solving is gradually replacing the supply chain’s traditionally siloed focus, Brasca says. For this to continue, TMS solutions need to be more interoperable. “The TMS needs to be aware of other parts of the supply chain,” he says.
The TMS industry also is moving to a “TMS-as-a-Service” model, rather than the perpetual license model that has been the norm.
Even as TMS solutions continue to improve, many businesses can benefit from investing in one sooner than they typically have. “Businesses stand to gain a significant competitive advantage if they consider investing in a TMS solution much earlier in their digital journey,” Valencia says.

The Western Australian Government has released the state’s first ever Electric Vehicle Strategy, which aims to increase the uptake of low and zero emission vehicles. The strategy is accompanied by a $21 million Electric Vehicle Fund – the largest single investment in EV charging infrastructure in Australia by a state or territory government. Infrastructure spoke with WA Minister for Climate Action, Amber-Jade Sanderson, on the Strategy and EV adoption in the state. 

By Patricia Mae 
Can you tell us a bit more about what the electric vehicle strategy involves?
The McGowan Government’s State Electric Vehicle Strategy outlines a suite of actions, supported by a $21 million investment, to assist the uptake of electric vehicles. It includes measures to install charging infrastructure; develop and update standards, guidelines, and planning approvals; and highlight the development of industry opportunities.
The aim of our State Electric Vehicle Strategy is to provide a pathway to decarbonising road transport in Western Australia.
What are the benefits of more EV adoption in the state?
Increasing the numbers of electric vehicles in Western Australia will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality in our cities and major regional centres. Electric vehicles will also reduce our reliance on imported oil, replacing it with domestically-produced electricity.
Electric vehicles present an opportunity to assist in decarbonising the electricity grid. In the future they will be able to provide vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid services that can soak up cheap excess solar energy during the middle of the day and potentially reduce the need for network investment.
What are some of the challenges to EV adoption in western Australia?
A key challenge in Western Australia is the vast size of our state and the need for further charging infrastructure. Measures that can be supported at the Commonwealth level, such as introducing vehicle carbon dioxide emission standards, will assist to improve electric vehicle model availability in Australia and Western Australia.
What infrastructure will be needed for the strategy?
As part of the strategy, the McGowan Government will create Australia’s longest electric vehicle fast charging network. This will allow travel north from Perth to Kununurra, south to Esperance and east to Kalgoorlie. The charging stations will be spaced approximately every 200km or less to ensure that public fast charging stations (50kW or more) are available along the designated routes.
What are the priority areas of action outlined in the strategy?
Key actions include:
Up to $20 million for the installation of a public electric vehicle fast charging networkA minimum 25 per cent electric vehicle acquisition target for the State Fleet by 2025-26, which will result in the acquisition of at least 255 electric vehicles over five years$800,000 for the installation of charging stations in government buildings to support the State Fleet electric vehicle targetDeveloping and updating standards, guidelines andplanning approval requirements to facilitate safe and efficient electric vehicle use and chargingUndertaking a trial of battery electric buses on the Joondalup Central Area Transit ServiceProviding reliable and accessible public information on electric vehicles – their features, performance, operation and benefitsDelivery of industry development actions under the Future Battery Industry Strategy Western Australia and Western Australian Renewable Hydrogen Strategy
What kind of job-creating opportunities could the strategy, and by extension more EV adoption, create for western australia?
The installation of the electric vehicle fast charging network will create jobs in Western Australia, particularly in regional areas. Global and domestic uptake of electric vehicles presents significant opportunities for industry and job creation in this state.
We have some of the world’s largest reserves of the minerals used to create batteries and we have the skills, infrastructure and standards to become a major player in the global battery value chain.
To complement opportunities in the battery industry, the McGowan Government is supporting industry efforts to grow the renewable hydrogen industry, with future potential for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles particularly in the long haul, heavy vehicle sector.
How does Western Australia compare to other states and territories in terms of EV adoption and what advice would you give them?
The McGowan Government’s commitment to building Australia’s longest fast charging network is one way we are leading the nation in creating the kind of infrastructure needed for Australian conditions, particularly here in WA.
This is a critical step and provides key connection points within every 200km, from Kununurra in the north to Esperance in the south and Kalgoorlie in the east. It will go some way to addressing anxiety about the current distance range of electric vehicles.
However, Australia’s access to the global electric vehicle market is constrained by a range of factors, including less stringent fuel emissions standards and lack of fuel efficiency or carbon emission standards.
The McGowan Government intends to work constructively with the Commonwealth, other state and territory governments, and industry to advocate for policy reforms aimed at ensuring Australian consumers can access a greater variety of electric vehicle models at lower prices.
Which other stakeholders will be involved in the implementation?
The Western Australian Electric Vehicles Working Group, chaired by the Western Australian Department of Water and Environmental Regulation, will assist in coordinating the implementation of the Strategy.
The WA Electric Vehicles Working Group includes membership of several State Government agencies; the energy utilities – Synergy, Horizon Power and Western Power; as well as the Western Australian Local Government Association and the Royal Automobile Club Western Australia.
In addition, the WA Electric Vehicles Working Group will continue to work closely with other stakeholders, including the Australian Electric Vehicles Association, industry, academia, training providers, non-government associations and organisations.
What are the next steps?
The charging infrastructure network will be installed and operational within three years. The McGowan Government aims to reach a minimum 25 per cent electric vehicle acquisition target, within eligible fleet segments, for the State Fleet within five years.
We will continue to monitor trends in electric vehicle technology and markets, and will review the strategy in the next three years. This will ensure Western Australia keeps pace with and continues to benefit from the opportunities presented by electric vehicles.

According to the United Nations Population Fund, more than half of the world’s population now lives in urban areas, and it is predicted that approximately 66 percent of the world’s population will live in an urban environment by 2050.
Massive efforts are underway today, designed to address the consequences of this surge, which, left unmanaged, would result in climate, energy, environment, and living conditions in the cities of the future.
Citizen engagement is mission-critical to achieving true Smart Cities, which can improve the lives of those who live, work and play in modern cities, but with this comes the important resolution of data security and privacy.
Today, the physical and digital infrastructures of cities are embedded with billions of devices at the edge, part of a “layered” approach to Smart City solutions.  We have already witnessed attacks, including unauthorized access to sensitive data and denial of service (DoS), which can quickly nullify the benefits of connected systems designed to support those who live in urban areas.
Even as early as 2015, nearly a quarter of a million citizens living in Ukraine suffered a long period of electricity disconnection because the power grid system was attacked by hackers.
Fast-forward to 2021, and now that many Smart City systems have been implemented, security and privacy issues have become a major challenge that requires effective countermeasures. The challenges are great when we add cameras, people counters, and other applications as traditional cybersecurity protection strategies cannot be applied directly to these given the heterogeneity and ever-evolving characteristics of smart cities.
For people to trust sophisticated Smart City solutions, we must address security and privacy threats when designing and implementing new mechanisms or systems.
We caught up this week with Avner Ziv, CEO of Cloud of Things, at the Frontier Conference, where Ziv spoke on a panel discussing the value, integrity, management, and security of big data lakes where sensor-generated information is stored and analyzed.
“Citizen concerns are very real,” Ziv said, “since, given the rapid development of information technologies including AI, machine learning, and data mining, adversaries are developing the ability to bypass the current detection mechanisms. Security and privacy are the only way to get to trust in Smart City applications, and so we are spending a great deal of time understanding and addressing the gaps.”
Ziv explained that there is no uniform IoT architecture; however, the Industrial IoT community and global ecosystem are heading in that direction. “The sensing layer is used for data collection from things, and that layer must be fully secured, from hardware and firmware to edge compute software. The network layer is the core layer in physical/digital architectures, and it must also be fully secured, whether the data is traversing the public Internet or private networks that connect smart things, network devices, and servers and ship data to the cloud through gateways.”
Ziv explained Smart City IoT as more of an Industrial IoT category, including additional layers for support, which works very closely with the application layer, and provides support for the requirements of diversified applications via intelligent computing techniques (edge, fog, and cloud).
“It is in the highest layer, the application layer, where we find the most challenges in terms of trust, as this layer provides intelligent and practical services or applications to users based on their personalized requirements,” Ziv said. “For example, a citizen within a Smart City may wish to understand and manage their energy consumption with smart meters, but they may be worried about the kind of behavioral data collected about their energy consumption at any hour of the day. We are observing a movement toward citizen engagement that enables individuals and families to contribute to carbon reduction, alongside the utilities, but are also seeing concerns about what that practically means.”
Ziv, whose company based in Israel is supporting certain government and service provider initiatives, also pointed out that smart government needs to manage data – interconnecting it across systems, institutions, digital and physical infrastructure management.
“We are seeing more and more demand for data ownership solutions – including the secure routing of data to more than one application or cloud,” Ziv said. “Citizens may trust more if they are aware that their data is not being used by special interests and that their data is being secured by government agencies on highly protected edge, network, and cloud application layers. Cloud of Things offers its customers the option to securely send data from their devices in the field directly to their private cloud tenant, while still enjoying our advanced device management features.”
Standardization and interoperability are also important areas to tackle, Ziv said. “Intelligent public transportation networks can enhance the safety, speed and reliability of light rail and traffic and parking management can benefit those who choose to use their private vehicles when they are in the city, but without a common understanding of how the collection, analysis, and activation of near-real-time systems works, natural concerns rise – for example, the government ‘tracking’ the moves of individuals and organizations.”
Ziv applauded the efforts of organizations like The Linux Foundation and their LF Edge projects which aim to build standards that will drive trust in the future. “We are already a highly connected society, and now a hyper-connected society,” Ziv said. “Only by collaboration, by bringing together public and private organizations, and by engaging individuals and businesses in the discussion can we sustainably develop solutions that provide personalized services but not at the risk of invasion of privacy and threats to freedom and democracy.”
Ziv presented at The Frontier Conference this week as part of a panel, “Data is the True Currency of Connected Industrial Solutions,” sponsored by Rocket Wagon Venture Studio and moderated by Don DeLoach. Chris Swan of Dispersive is also on the panel.

According to a recently released study, autonomous vehicles (AVs) hold significant potential to open up wider economic opportunities currently beyond the reach of many low-income households due to inadequate transportation. 
 By Ken Briodagh 
The report, “Fostering Economic Opportunity through Autonomous Vehicle Technology,” by SAFE, reportedly concludes that on-demand, point-to-point AV transit can cut financial stress by providing reliable, affordable and efficient transportation that is a crucial factor in determining the upward social mobility of low-income households.
Although the post-pandemic priority for transit agencies is to get current transportation systems back up to speed, AV trials are still necessary to incorporate low-cost, autonomous transit into the future transportation mix as soon as possible—at per-mile costs far lower than today’s transportation options.
 As a result, low-income communities would be able to access opportunities that are out of reach due to enduring gaps in current systems, particularly outside of traditional business hours.
“The biggest factor in upward economic mobility is actual mobility, and for many Americans, today’s transportation system simply isn’t an affordable or efficient option,” said Robbie Diamond, President and CEO, SAFE. “It is important that the immediate focus be on getting America up and running again, but today’s AV pilots will become tomorrow’s automated, integrated transportation system that serves everyone equally and effectively, regardless of location or time of day.”
SAFE’s report notes:
The most conservative cost-per-mile estimate for an autonomous, shared and electric car in 2030 is 50 cents. In contrast, the cost per mile for buses today is $1.31.More than 75 million households—almost two-thirds of U.S. households—live in neighborhoods with housing and transportation costs above 45 percent of typical household income, a level that forces many families to make difficult choices and which is also hard to sustain over time.For every 1 percent reduction in the cost of transportation with a fixed housing cost, approximately 750,000 households enter affordability.AV transportation could reduce household costs by as much as $5,600 per household, or $3,800 per American. SAFE found that reducing average transportation costs by $5,000 per year in urbanized neighborhoods brings more than 25 million households within the 45 percent threshold.Employment growth areas in our modern economy—such as job opportunities in e-commerce—remain accessible only by car. For instance, SAFE found that Amazon’s 60 largest U.S. fulfillment centers and facilities are inaccessible to those who work there, unless commuting by personal vehicle, which makes it hard for people to benefit from these new economic opportunities.Transportation is a typical household’s second-largest expense, behind housing, and low- and middle-income populations find the lower housing costs when they move to suburbs and exurbs are often offset by the higher amount they spend on transportation. As their housing costs decrease, their transportation costs can increase by as much as five times, as measured by a share of income.The necessity of owning a car to access jobs forces millions of low-income Americans to make difficult choices to keep a personal vehicle. Seven million Americans are at least three months behind on car payments, and many that do make car payments often do so instead of paying rent or mortgages.

By Shubhankar GautamIn areas, both big and small, parking systems are a headache for both commuters and city governments. Most resident parking, pay, and display systems are either overcrowded or not adequately located. One of the best ways to tackle both these issues is by using park and ride systems in urban areas.
What Are “Park and Ride” systems?
Thousands of residents use private transport to travel to work, make grocery runs, or catch up with friends. All these activities are necessary but end up crowding the roads, mainly if everyone uses a separate car. While carpooling is a viable solution, it won’t work entirely if different people have the same route but various destinations in mind.
That is where a system like Park and Ride systems can reduce the number of vehicles on the road. Under Park and Ride systems, commuters park their private cars in designated parking spots, which are well connected with public transport hubs. They then use public transportation to cover the remaining distance to their destination.
This intermodal parking and transport system is already being practiced in thousands of cities in various countries. In places where “Park and Ride” has been systematically implemented, it has helped reduce traffic congestions, thus improving public transport usage and better organizing parking systems.
Advantages of Park and Ride systems
Some salient features of every park and ride system are as follows.
Park and ride systems improve urban mobility to a large extent. As several private vehicles are not used simultaneously, traffic congestion reduces, which in turn, reduces commute time. The system also encourages public transport usage and generates more revenue for city governments.Carpooling, an effective way to reduce both pollution and traffic congestion in urban areas, becomes the most popular when well-planned park and ride locations are introduced throughout a city. As people do not have to struggle with finding a fellow rider the whole way to a destination, they also embrace traveling with a friend or a family member more readily.Even people from suburban areas benefit from a park and ride system as residents traveling to the city center need not waste fuel commuting hundreds of miles each day. They can instead drive to a park and ride lot and use public transit from there to enter the city. This advantage, however, is apparent only when the park and ride lots are also situated on the outskirts of a town.
Any park and ride location is best when located away from sites of heavy congestion. While easily accessible, these areas should not be located very close to places that remain heavily crowded, especially during peak hours. These locations should also be well connected with public transport networks so that they are incentivizing enough for all commuters. Once a municipality decides to construct a park and ride lot, steps must be taken for proper implementation and maintenance. It must be kept clean and should not be overly expensive.
Considering the host of advantages this system offers and the relatively small investment, it demands, park and ride lots are a future-proof way of reducing traffic congestion in urban areas. They also make cities more pleasant for both commuters and tourists, and when planned carefully, they have very few downsides. For cities looking to turn smart, park and ride is a must-adopt system.

Photonic integration has become a key technology for bringing costs down and achieving the performance needed for autonomous vehicles. 
By  Jeff Hecht 
When it comes to autonomous vehicles, the industry is shifting gears. Late in 2020, Honda said that this March it would introduce so-called “Traffic Jam Assist” in its Japanese Legend model; it’s autonomy in the slow lane, a feature that takes over control of a personal car when highway traffic slows to a crawl. Then, says the manual, it uses radar and cameras to automatically follow the car ahead at a safe distance, as long as the road is nearly straight and with detectable lane markers.1 This frees the human driver from having to worry about traffic until it picks up to highway speed, at which point the has to take the wheel again. Robo-taxis lacking any controls for human drivers have slipped further into the future.
A bigger shift in the works is putting autonomous systems in control of long-haul trucks. Big rigs spend long hours on the road, and typically some 95% of their mileage is on well-maintained, limited-access highways—a well-controlled environment that is friendly for autonomous vehicles. In the near-term, developers envision keeping a human in the truck to take the wheel when needed to go off-highway to depots or to steer through difficult situations like temporary detours directed by road crews. Full Level 4 autonomy would come in a few more years as the technology is refined and verified. Big rigs are big investments, and the savings of having robots able to drive straight through without rest stops or sleep could pay for the new technology.
A bumpy road toward autonomy
These shifts in direction partly reflect economic and technological limits, but the most important limit may be the capabilities of human drivers. Developers originally envisioned that automotive autonomy would shift control from human drivers to robots by progressing through the levels shown in the sidebar (see “Levels of autonomy”). The original target was Level 3 autonomy, with the robot driving the car and the human driver with eyes on the road and hands on the wheel, ready to take over if needed with little or no warning.
However, in reality, people are easily distracted even when they are driving a car. If they are just watching the car drive, their eyes are likely to wander to their phone or some other screen than to stay on the road. Tesla drivers not looking ahead have been killed when their cars failed to recognize white trucks crossing the road ahead of them against a blue sky. An Uber vehicle killed a pedestrian walking a bicycle across a road at night because it could not recognize the pedestrian; when it turned control over to the safety driver, she just had time to look up from her phone when the car smashed into the pedestrian.
These fatal accidents have led many developers to think that Level 3 is a bad idea; many companies are expected to jump straight from Level 2 to Level 4, which requires the car to be able to handle most conditions without human assistance.2 The public has also grown wary, especially after embarrassing nonfatal accidents such as a self-driving car crashing into a bright-red fire truck stopped in the road with lights flashing. The pandemic slammed the brakes on development in early 2020, but companies had already been slowing development to refine technology and reduce costs.
Personal cars vs. robo-taxis
Tesla Motors (Palo Alto, CA) delivered almost half a million personal cars in 2020, a 35% increase over 2019.3 All Teslas since March 2019 come with the Autopilot feature, and enhanced software called “Full Self-Driving Capability” is available as an option offering extra features. Among the extras is the ability for the car to drive from highway on-ramp to off-ramp, navigating interchanges, changing lanes, and taking the correct exit. However, the company emphasizes that the self-driving features “require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.”4 In other words, it still expects the driver to have eyes on the road and hands on the wheel.
Like Honda’s traffic-jam pilot, Tesla’s control system uses radars and cameras to sense the environment, but not lidar. Two years ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk proclaimed “anyone relying on lidar is doomed,” and that radar and cameras are good enough for navigation.5 It might be fairer to say that lidars are too expensive for Tesla to make a profit selling personal cars with self-driving features.
Honda’s Traffic Jam Assist appears to be using similar technology, but only for following the car ahead through traffic moving so slowly that serious injuries are unlikely. The manual is cautious, warning that the feature will not work properly when following a motorcycle, entering a toll booth, or if the car being followed shifts to another lane. Some other companies have developed similar systems for personal cars.
Robo-taxis being developed by Google’s Waymo division, GM’s Cruise, and other companies are a different market: companies offering personal transport as a service. These vehicles would be on the road much of the time, not sitting in garages like personal cars, helping to offset costs of lidar needed for autonomy. Level 4 autonomy would be desirable. However, those plans have slowed, and Uber Technologies (San Francisco, CA), an early pioneer, sold its autonomous car group to Aurora (Bozeman, MT) in December.6
Nobody is delivering cars with true Level 4 autonomy now, says Jason Eichenholz, co-founder and chief technology officer at Luminar Technologies (Orlando, FL). However, in 2022 Volvo will begin distributing cars with an optional system called Volvo Highway Pilot that combines Luminar’s Iris 1550 nm lidar with other sensors and autonomy software from Zenseact (Göteborg, Sweden). The lidar will be the first in a consumer vehicle.
On controlled-access highways, Eichenholz says the Volvo offering will be “a true driver out of the loop” system with Level 4 autonomy. Highway traffic can be fast, but the environment is much more predictable than city or suburban streets, with no cross traffic, pedestrians, traffic signals, or bicycles. Level 4 autonomy with high-performance lidars provides long sensing ranges and high point density to identify objects in the highway environment and safely steer around them. The car would turn driving over to the human in other environments, so a typical driver would guide the car from home to highway, the car would drive from there to the off ramp, and the human would resume control when leaving the highway to drive to their destination.
“Over time, you will see the operational domain of that Level 4 experience expand” to cover more of the driving experience as technology improves, says Eichenholz. But don’t expect a rapid transition. “Getting to Level 5 with the driver fully out of the loop in all operational domains is really hard,” he says. “It’s easy to get to 99% coverage [of roadways], but regulators want five nines.” There’s a good reason for that. Rural America is full of unmarked and unpaved roads, and foul weather can cut visibility to a car length and transform highways into slippery messes.
A boom in robo-trucks
As in personal cars, Tesla aims to be the first to market with large trucks with autonomous features. In January, the company announced it will begin manufacturing Tesla Semi trucks this year, and they will include autonomous driving features similar to those in Tesla autos.7 However, the main focus of the Semi appears to be its all-electric “zero emission” power system, which led Walmart to order 130 of the trucks in September 2020.8
Other companies see long-haul trucking as potentially the biggest near-term market for autonomous vehicles. It’s an $800 billion per-year business in the U.S., and it runs up most of its mileage on Interstate highways. The trucking industry says it needs 60,000 more truckers now, and the shortage is expected to grow as veteran drivers retire, making autonomy attractive. Luminar has teamed with Daimler Trucks and Torc Robotics to develop Level 4 autonomous truck systems. The size of big rigs is an advantage because it gives them room to space sensors more widely and to carry other automation systems.
Much technology used in autonomous cars can be transferred to trucks. However, “the dynamics and functional behaviors of trucks are very different” from those of passenger cars, says Chuck Price, chief product officer at TuSimple (San Diego, CA).9 Trucks are big, and fully loaded they have a huge momentum at highway speeds, so they need long-range sensing and object recognition to stop them safely. TuSimple equips its trucks with 10 high-definition cameras that can identify vehicles up to 1000 m away (day or night, rain or shine), giving them plenty of room to steer around other vehicles or stop when needed (see Fig. 1). Five microwave radars can detect and identify objects up to 300 m away, important if fog or rain impairs vision. A pair of lidars with 200 m range give detailed views of objects inside that range.
So far, TuSimple trucks have been driving test runs with human safety drivers onboard between Arizona and Texas. Sometime this year, they plan to have a truck drive the route in autonomous mode without active human supervision, although a safety driver and a test engineer will be in the vehicle monitoring its performance. TuSimple’s goal is demonstrating Level 4 driving between terminals located a short distance from highway exits. The company has teamed with Navistar, the maker of International trucks, to begin producing Level 4 autonomous trucks by 2024 for highway use. Several other companies have similar plans including Embark, Google’s Waymo subsidiary,10 Plus Technology, and Aurora, a Silicon-Valley area company which bought Uber’s autonomous vehicle group in December 2020 and plans to introduce autonomy in trucks before cars.
Meeting manufacturing needs
A key challenge for the photonics industry is building manufacturing technology on the size and scale needed for automotive use, says Eichenholz. Industry requirements are tough. They insist on volume production at an affordable cost to withstand temperatures from -40° to 80°C. Automotive customers need time to test the safety and quality of new products, and they then need a couple of years to get a new product on the production line.
Building a supply chain and automating production takes human and financial resources. Luminar started by building products internally, then developed partnerships with contract manufacturers and others. They began by building from the chip level up, doing die placement, wire bonding, and other steps. As their products evolved, they put more and more functions into application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to drive down costs and improve performance. For example, they put signal processing into ASICs to avoid the capacitance of wire bonds to detectors and the inductance of laser circuits.
The company’s lidar expertise helped them balance tradeoffs in their pulsed 1550 nm time-of-flight (ToF) lidar. Eichenholz says they chose mechanical scanning because it “is really reliable, with none of the resonance or temperature problems you have with MEMS.” Mechanical polygon mirrors scan fast in the horizontal plane; galvanometers scan slowly in the vertical direction. The technology was used 40 years ago in bar-code scanners, and now it can be very cost-effective in volume. Scanning both the output beam and the receiver makes the field of view very narrow, blocking interference from the sun and other sources.
Photonic integration promises to improve lidar cost and performance. Luminar is working to reduce costs of driver-assistance lidars to $500, and of the more precise lidars needed for autonomous cars to $1000.11 Those are huge drops from earlier levels in the tens of thousands of dollars, and they helped attract deals with Volvo and Daimler Trucks. In November, Mobileye, an Israeli subsidiary of Intel, chose Luminar’s lidars for its first-generation Level 4 autonomous driving system for robo-taxis.12 Luminar has plenty of competition in ToF lidar, including Velodyne Lidar (San Jose, CA), which began offering lidars in 2010, and several other companies.
Competing lidar technologies
An alternative lidar technology also is emerging. In January 2021, Mobileye announced plans to build future versions of its automated driving system by 2025 to a new chip-scale frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) lidar being developed at Intel.13
FMCW lidar chirps the frequency of the outgoing beam and mixes return signals coherently with part of the outgoing signal. Comparing the frequencies determines target distance and can directly measure velocity; ToF systems cannot measure velocity directly. Advocates cite other advantages of coherent lidars, including relative immunity to interference from sunlight and other lidars, higher sensitivity, and lower peak power.14
J. K. Doylend and S. Gupta of Intel’s Silicon Photonic Product division reported at SPIE Photonics West 2020 that the FMCW lidar’s ability to directly detect both range and velocity was very attractive for autonomous cars. Achieving that performance required dense integration of optics including lasers, amplifiers, phase and amplitude control, low-noise photodetectors, mode converters, and waveguides, but integration can produce compact lidars in high volume.15
Current lidar systems combine information from cameras, ToF lidars, and radars to steer vehicles. Mobileye’s new system will combine FMCW lidar data with radar to create one viewing channel, and use camera data to produce a second independent channel. They believe that combination will improve safety and performance when commercial versions arrive in 2025. “This is really game-changing,” Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua said in January at the virtual Consumer Electronics Show (CES).16
Aurora is already testing FMCW lidars from Insight Lidar (Lafayette, CO) on its developmental autonomous trucks (see Fig. 2). FMCW lidar offers long detection range and higher sensitivity, important for long-range detection needed at highway speeds, says Greg Smolka, Insight Laser’s vice president of business development. They target having early versions in use by 2023, significant volume by 2025, and production use in autonomous cars in 2026.FIGURE 2.

The lidar is in the middle of the sensor bar above the windshield; other sensors are at right and left.(Courtesy of Aurora)
Smolka says direct detection of velocity on every return makes FMCW lidar useful in discriminating between objects as well as measuring their velocity. “The images of a motorcycle passing a truck can blur together in a camera because they are at the same range, but if you have velocity in the data, the two are easily discriminated,” he says. Having velocity with every pixel can enhance resolution for the difficult “edge cases” where it’s otherwise hard to meet performance levels needed for Level 4 and 5 autonomy.
Another FMCW maker, Aeva (Mountain View, CA), says its lidar has a 300 m range, high pixel density at all ranges, and a 120° × 30° field of view available now. In January, Aeva announced a partnership with TuSimple to deploy its “4D” lidar on their Level 4 autonomous trucks.
Another potential competitor is flash lidar, originally developed to avoid moving parts in docking or landing spacecraft. Laser pulses are spread across a range of angles, and receiver optics focus returns onto a two-dimensional detector array. Processing the returned signals yields a three-dimensional point cloud, with distance gathered from the return time. It has the advantage of simplicity, but the dispersion of pulse energy across a wide range limits received power, which usually has constrained range to under 100 m.17
Outlook
Autonomous vehicles have made amazing progress in the past several years, but challenges remain.
Lidar must solve some technical issues to meet the needs of autonomy. Near the top of the list is the inherent tradeoff between lidar range and the density of the point cloud it can measure at a distance. Lidars are very good at mapping objects a few tens of meters away, but the points spread further apart with distance. At 100 m, points spaced at 0.025° intervals are 8.7 cm apart. That’s not going to put enough points on a pedestrian to tell if they are about to cross the street or are looking in the opposite direction. Even the speed of light is an issue because lidar pulses must be spaced far apart for light to make a round trip: 1.3 μs for an object at 200 m, limiting repetition rate to 770,000 Hz.
Other technologies used in autonomy and the road environment pose other challenges. So does the unusual and unexpected. Can we count on an autonomous car to slam on the brakes for a person carrying a bag, but not a bag blowing in the wind?
Photonic integration and good engineering will help overcome these challenges. (It may even help with artificial intelligence; watch for an upcoming article.) We also may have to accept limitations. I’ve lived in New England long enough to have learned that the best way to get through foul weather is to wait for it to blow away.

What will our future cities, and the infrastructure that helps them function, look like? With so much industry evolution, the answer to this is continually changing. This year’s Critical Infrastructure Summit held an industry panel bringing together some of the best minds in infrastructure delivery and city planning to explore this and look at the impact of digital technologies, future mobility, sustainability and accessibility on the future of the sector.
The industry panel was sponsored by Nearmap and held during the Summit’s final session Future of Infrastructure. The panellists were Damian Gould, CEO, Building Queensland; Marion Terrill, Transport and Cities Program Director, Grattan Institute Melbourne; and Stephen Neale, Product Manager – 3D, Nearmap. COVID-19 showed us how quickly things can change in just a few months, with the pandemic impacting the way people use infrastructure in Australia.
While it’s still uncertain if these changes in behaviour will be temporary or permanent, it does bring up the question: do we need to be rethinking the way we plan our cities? Marion noted that as Australia and the world is still dealing with COVID, it’s unclear what the end state will be.
“We’re not yet in a stable situation where we know where we’re standing, so it’s a time of high uncertainty. I think that does affect the way that we plan cities as we have to plan them to be resilient to a range of possible future scenarios,” Marion said.
She said there are a few things that we know for certain have changed, including the fact that population growth has ground to halt with the closing of international borders, and that there has been a move out of public transport and into cars – with cities having to learn to manage the switch in demand.
“It’s very much an open question as to whether we will get back to the levels of population growth that we’ve seen in the last decade or so, and that’s important because the business cases for a lot of urban infrastructure have been underpinned by population growth,” Marion said.
“The other thing I would raise in terms of how we think about planning cities in a world with COVID, is that it has a big impact on people’s transport choices, and we’re certainly seeing that at the moment in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.”
Damian’s work with Building Queensland helps drive the development of the state’s major infrastructure business cases so he views the planning and development of our major cities on a more project-specific basis.
“Clearly COVID has demonstrated that when developing the business case for a major transport project, even if you stress test the assumptions and come up with different scenarios, no one could have dreamt that we’d have a scenario where public transport patronage went down by 80 per cent,” Damian said.
“Now those levels are starting to come back up again but it’s a slow transition, and people are starting to see some of the immediate impacts around increased traffic congestion.”
He said COVID has put into question previous assumptions around where main population nodes will be, both in terms of where people decide to live and how employment hubs, transport and other requirements will connect and service citizens.
“I think some of the more immediate learnings that have come out of COVID is thinking more about how you manage the flow of people, or try to build into the design process some element of how people can physically distance. There’s a recognition of those sort of perimeters being built into individual matters like building and asset design.”
Stephen Neale from Nearmap agreed and also pointed out that the data gathered over years and years that outlines long-term trends has now been flipped on its head. “This situation has changed very quickly and the predictions and the models that we may have had previously don’t quite apply now, so we need to think about how we can plan for the future and make decisions with new trends not apparent in past data,” Stephen said.
Industry risks and challenges
Damian believes that the most enduring challenge for Australia’s infrastructure and cities will be the appropriate planning and security of water supply to major cities and regional centres, which he says is an emerging issue in several parts of Queensland.
In addition, he said that there needs to be a focus on health and a requirement to evolve and embrace digital healthcare. “We really need to make sure the physical and digital assets continue to address the emerging and growing service needs in healthcare,” Damian said.
While for Marion, the biggest challenge she sees is the way that infrastructure decisions made by the government are often politicised.
“By way of example, I could say most major projects are committed to without actually having a business case, and sometimes one is done after, but it is more often than not, not actually informing the decision to invest.
“The reason that this matters is that we are in a changing world; we are facing these challenges, particularly around climate change, sustainability and the pandemic, and we need to make good infrastructure decisions – and they need to be able to change when the circumstances around us change.
“I feel that there is a substantial challenge, or risk really, facing future investment in infrastructure because we seem to be stuck in a manner of decision-making that isn’t really serving us very well,” Marion said.
Digitally connected infrastructure
Australia’s infrastructure is constantly evolving and becoming more digitally connected, and the panel talked about the technological advancements they think will have the biggest impact on our cities in the future. Stephen said there are organisations rolling out 5G infrastructure across Australia which provides access to real-time communication.
“As that infrastructure is being rolled out we start to realise that idea of real-time communication. If we have real-time sensors and real-time communication we can allow things like vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and vehicle-to infrastructure communication.
“Having worked in the car navigation industry in the past, there was this one picture of the future that really stood out to me, and it was this concept of communication between vehicles and infrastructure that meant we no longer needed traffic lights – cars could speak to each other and cross each other at intersections without causing any accidents.
“This sort of decision-making is actually a realisation of the technology that’s evolving out there now. This 5G technology is enabling communication, and real-time sensors are setting us up for this huge wealth of data that’s coming in, and what we need to do now is come up with the decision-making frameworks to best use that data.”
For Damian, he sees huge potential in the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. “There’s current pilots looking at that in the context of how to better predict project outcomes from a cost and scheduling perspective. But the applications for assessing the demand for infrastructure that will inform business cases and design processes is important.”
While Marion is excited that the technology is now sufficiently developed to make it realistic to introduce congestion charging. “It’s a real opportunity for our cities. I know it’s kind of political poison, but particularly in a world of COVID where people’s instinct is to go out in the car and not worry about their own contribution to slowing everyone else down, charging a small congestion charge is a counter to that so people who can be flexible take their trip at a different time of day,” Marion said.
“It seems to me that in lots of ways it has been difficult to contemplate congestion charging schemes because the technology was not great, but I think that has changed now. To me it’s game-changing in terms of what we can do and how we can get more out of the infrastructure that we’ve already got.”
Sustainable assets for the future
Marion said the main thing that’s important when it comes to sustainability is to be robust to a range of future scenarios. “What’s important here is that in mature cities, you’ve got most of the infrastructure that you’re ever going to have really, so that you use it as effectively as you can and that you look after it properly.
“There are service gaps, so to think about what is a sustainable city, it is a vibrant and inclusive place where people can get around, so that they don’t have to operate in a disconnected village. Sustainability for me is a lot about accessibility and connectedness, but it’s about the stewardship of what we have and using it to the best effect.”
Damian said the industry needs to think about future scenarios as it tries to plan infrastructure investments to provide services over a project’s 20-30 year lifespan – from what’s the demand, to how do you design and configure the relevant infrastructure solutions to meet that service need.
“It’s a bit of a mind shift in taking it beyond the benefits of this transport project, such as travel time savings for commuters and car users, and a reduction in operating costs. It’s looking at what are the broader societal implications and benefits and how do you structure the narrative around that,” Damian said.

With a pandemic gripping our world right now, busy roads seem like a thing of the past. That is, however, hardly true. As soon as life starts getting back on track, traffic congestion will be back in full force, and city governments will struggle immeasurably with traffic management. 
Urban areas, both big and small, will return to day-long traffic jams and significantly longer commute times. Such problems affect the ordinary citizen the most, and every city looking to turn smart must first tackle them. Here are some truly “smart” ways to fight to overcrowd and reduce traffic congestion with smart city tech in urban areas. These apply to cities of all sizes and have already been employed successfully by many city governments.
Traffic Light Optimization
Smart programming and digitization can be used to control traffic light operations in both large and small urban areas. When traffic lights co-ordinate ideally and respond to demand in real-time, road capacity can be maximized quickly. Smart traffic lights can also be synced to the movement of larger vehicles or conditioned to respond appropriately to situations like gridlock or blockage. All of this programming can be done with expert knowledge of the non-linear relationship between traffic flow and delay.
Parking Zone Extension
The exacerbation of traffic congestion in urban areas is mostly a result of limited parking spaces. Even in larger cities, controlled parking zones are limited to certain main streets. There is usually an unbalanced mix of residents’ parking, pay and display, and limited wait parking zones.
 The best way to tackle congestion is to extend parking controls away from the city center and formulate smart parking zones, even in less crowded areas. To enhance their functioning further, these parking zones can have virtual permits, 1-hour time limits, and regular patrolling by civil law enforcement officers. Making them smart would mean collecting real-time data on commuter parking and directing the crowd to emptier zones accordingly.
Autonomous Vehicle Usage
While using autonomous or self-driven vehicles will not reduce congestion quantitatively, it will help manage traffic in a more advanced fashion. Without human intervention, smart cars can practice effective collision management, discover new roads to reach a destination, platoon perfectly, and gather data about free and empty parking zones to decide the best parking spot. Moreover, smart vehicles will also eliminate traffic jams caused solely due to human error. All of these combined reduce both commute time and congestion well.
Pedestrian Traffic Monitoring
Smart city management authorities should not blatantly assume that the sole cause of traffic congestion is vehicle traffic. Pedestrian traffic, when ignored, is equally worrying. Having realized this, cities like Las Vegas and Los Angeles are using V2I technology to monitor pedestrian traffic and reroute vehicle traffic accordingly. The data thus collected is also useful in traffic light optimization to increase road safety. For instance, Los Angeles is making the data gathered public to real estate developers and locality planners to help them build residential complexes in locations that experience less congestion.
Drone Usage by City Management
This is one of the best ideas to reduce traffic congestion with smart city tech. With the development of IoT based drones, most tasks that once needed inspectors, repair and delivery professionals, or city officials to travel in vehicles can now be done via drone cameras. Smart cities that employ drones to carry out minor repair tasks and most inspection tasks can quickly reduce the number of trucks and buses on the road, especially during peak hours. Even private companies like Amazon are now experimenting with drone-based deliveries in highly congested cities, and there’s no reason governments can’t do the same.
Levying Workplace Parking Charges
Most workplaces offer their employees the option of free parking. This incentive encourages people to commute to the office every day in separate cars since they don’t have to pay anything to park at the office even for long hours. A workplace parking fee is known to have a significant effect on both congestion and pollution. Levying a charge on workplace parking can be useful in promoting carpooling amongst employees, which will, in turn, reduce congestion on roads. It will also improve public transport usage and allow both private and public firms to re-evaluate their parking space usage.
Building V2I Smart Corridors
Using V2I technology to make roads smarter is one of the best ways to reduce congestion in cities. Using connected video cameras and satellite imaging, drivers can be informed about accidents and weather-related alerts as they drive on particular roads and expressways. These roads would act as smart transit corridors, where all the vehicle drivers would have information about the conditions about to welcome them in the next few miles. They can then decide to reroute from a congested road or slow down to avoid further crowding.
These innovative methods require minimal spending and are long-term solutions suitable for even the most heavily congested cities. Governments need to plan well, use IoT, AI, and digitization, and respond timely to a crisis, to make urban roads smooth for commuters at all hours of the day.

German lawmakers agreed to allow some driverless vehicles on public roads, a first step toward enabling autonomous driving in Europe’s biggest economy.
Lawmakers in the lower house of parliament adopted legislation enabling automated driving under some conditions. The bill, approved late May 20, cites scenarios including small buses and logistics vehicles that can shuttle passengers and goods along pre-determined routes.
Next-level technologies hold the potential to enhance safety and efficiency in transportation, but it takes a lot of work behind the scenes to advance these ideas from concept to reality. We talk with Christoph Mertz of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon and Huei Peng of the University of Michigan. Hear a snippet above, and get the full program by going to RoadSigns.TTNews.com.
“This is the world’s first legal framework for autonomous driving in regular operation,” Ulrich Lange, a deputy leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s bloc in parliament, said in a statement May 21.
Germany is keen to catch up in the field of autonomous driving, a technology that could reshape the transport industry but is enormously complex and costly. The biggest advances so far have been made by Waymo and Cruise in the U.S. as well as Baidu Inc. in China.
The legislation allows for Level 4 autonomy — meaning a vehicle that can drive itself under certain conditions. For a car to qualify, Germany requires that a human is able to shut it down in case of issues, either by sitting inside it or accessing it remotely, according to the bill.
The German government expects projects next year. The upper house of parliament still needs to approve the legislation.

Wise Systems developed an automated route planning and execution system for last-mile fleets to optimize the delivery experience for their customers.
Investments in the last-mile transportation and logistics sector have been soaring for companies that are not directly competing with the delivery models of UPS, FedEx and the United States Postal Service.
One of the hottest commodities in the last-mile sector has been the same-day delivery of food, beverage and grocery items. Since 2011, funding for crowdsourced delivery platforms such as Instacart and Uber Eats reached $14 billion, according to Deloitte research.
Other fast growing segments include big and bulky freight deliveries and items with extra-sensitive service requirements like medical samples and supplies.
No matter the freight type, delivery expectations in the last-mile sector are driven by Amazon, which currently fulfills 72% of orders for Prime customers within 24 hours.
The defining moment in Amazon’s last-mile strategy was its 2018 launch of the Delivery Service Partner (DSP) program. Since then, Amazon has been contracting with local delivery companies to compete directly with UPS and FedEx on a massive scale. Today the DSP program counts more than 1,300 delivery firms and 20,000 delivery vans in its ranks worldwide.
One of the benefits for fleets that are Amazon DSPs is having access to sophisticated delivery technology, but the downside is the ease with which the world’s largest online retailer cuts contracts. This has forced many local delivery fleets to search for new opportunities.
Down to the last footWith the amount of investment dollars and capacity flowing into the last mile segment, some technology companies have found opportunities to give fleets a competitive edge by solving complex routing problems.
Generally, fleets have a majority of their deliveries planned in advance for the next day but need to dynamically add stops to these routes for 30% to 40% of orders that come in during the day with same-day delivery expectations.
Solving complex routing problems has positioned some companies to offer fleets an automated dispatch process, which will be even more valuable when autonomous vehicles arrive on the scene.
In 2014, the prospects for using autonomous vehicles for last-mile delivery were bright, and the founders of Wise Systems saw a market opportunity to develop autonomous dispatch, route planning and execution software for last-mile delivery companies.
Wise Systems is not a technology company like Instacart or Uber Eats that is trying to operate in the logistics space. Rather, it offers its technology to fleets. Although the arrival of autonomous delivery vehicles did not happen as originally planned, fleets are using the software to optimize route planning and execution down to the final feet of deliveries, said Ali Kamil, chief technology officer and co-founder of Wise Systems.
The cloud-based software captures time, location and other route data every few seconds from an app that runs on mobile devices. The software knows when drivers arrive, when they get to a customer’s door and when they depart.
With this granular level of data capture — which includes the number and weight of delivery units — the software predicts how long it will take to complete future deliveries at each customer location. It also learns from repeat visits to determine the best way to enter, the best spot to park and the best time to visit to expedite the delivery process.
“Collecting all of this data enables us to learn,” Kamil said, “so we can plan better tomorrow.”
The mobile driver app is easy to use and helps drivers make more money by completing more deliveries each day. “Drivers don’t want to be spending time monkeying around,” he noted. “It needs to be quick and easy.”
Fleets that use the software can dynamically add stops into a route optimization engine and give their customers access to a web portal for tracking the status of deliveries. The end customer can also sign up to receive text or email notifications.
The end customer can get real-time expected time of arrival with accuracy down to five minutes, he said. With this level of visibility, “what we are enabling for customers is a better and faster delivery experience than Amazon,” he said. “We are not just going accept that Amazon is going to dominate.”

Autonomous driving is one of the most disruptive developments we’ve seen to this day. It will change the way we think of cities, roads, parking, commuting, leisure, ownership, and will spawn new jobs as the business models unfold. Many open questions have answers in business models, infrastructure, technology direction, and development.
Transportation as a Service
Many automotive OEMs believe that transportation is set for fundamental disruption and will be very different in the future. OEMs like BMW sell directly to consumers today but experimenting with ridesharing, fleet sales, time splitting, etc., creating Transportation as a Service (TaaS) business models. On-demand business models will alter profit pool configurations in the transportation industry with value shifting to technology, data, design, and platforms and away from dealerships or hardware.
Operating System Enabled Value Chain
Operating systems are the heartbeat of any ecosystem but have been monetized differently by technology players. Apple (iOS) charges a premium for hardware, and Google (Android) drives more advertising revenue. At the same time, Microsoft (Windows) is monetized directly -control of the OS is vital to the autonomous driving value chain as it impacts customer experiences and relationships through control.
Both Detroit and Silicon Valley are in a race to create and control this Operating System. While Tesla mimics the iOS model, Baidu is looking at “open source” technology to monetize ancillary products/services, and Uber is building a partner ecosystem to create scale.Autonomous driving is quickly becoming a reality, Here are various business models that can help enable and drive the value chain for businesses.Click To Tweet
Multiple models will likely emerge, co-exist, and compete, impacting capitalization, scale, margins, marketing, sales, and future investments. The Tesla-style business model will be aesthetically appealing, given the hardware focus building exceptional design. The Baidu model will be hinging on design and driving up accessories, services, support, etc. The right package and quantity of sensors will also depend on the OS strategy adopted, impacting ancillary players’ value. Open and closed strategies for the OS, (e.g., iOS vs. Android), will also create consequences like safety legislation, competitive dynamics, standardization of infrastructure, and more.
Fleets and Logistics
The existing approach to logistics would change by eliminating constraints around commercial fleets today. These include driving hour limitations, better asset utilization, less downtime, faster movement of goods, reduced congestion, and improved operating costs.
Governments have been considering autonomous only zones and reduced need for parking lots. New business specialties and opportunities will emerge in urban planning and management/monitoring of fleets through new players. Fleets create business models around access frequency, usage time, or miles consumed. Given the long depreciation cycles of existing fleets and cost factors to create AV fleets, semi-autonomous or retrofit capabilities are a short-term revenue stream.
Data-Driven Value Chain
Autonomous vehicles will consume and generate data at unprecedented levels. The data comes from various sources and components like cameras, radars, lidars, GPS, sensors, maps, and smart infrastructure. All this data must be aggregated in real-time and trained to navigate roads, avoid obstacles, provide safety, comply with rules, and create personalized experiences.  The volume, velocity, and intake of this data will require new infrastructure, software-defined processing capabilities, and new business models. Many partnerships have evolved to co-create new data sets or have access to it like HD maps.
Initially, this data must be trained by humans and machine learning models––“human in the loop” method ––while deep learning will occur in the cloud, machine learning executes on the vehicle itself. The ownership, consumption, and monetization of all this data will inform business models as multiple new startups emerge only around this data value chain.
Software Defined Value Chain
Technology companies create value by commoditizing suppliers and monetizing consumers through efficient channels. In transportation, ridesharing companies like Uber and Lyft have also aggregated demand through a channel (platform technology) and commoditized the supply side, making the vehicle type less important for riders. Uber and Lyft both want to consolidate their positions as the future focal point of transportation by investing in autonomous driving initiatives.
Many players like Google, legacy OEMs, new players like Tesla, and auto suppliers are competing in the value chain. The electrification of cars, fleets, and the viability of new powertrains will directly impact AVs’ fixed and operating costs. A new transportation and mobility ecosystem is expected to be faster, cheaper, cleaner, safer, more customized, and more efficient in all aspects. The higher end of the value chain will create stronger positions to foundations to accelerate this nascent but promising sector.
Internet of Vehicles and V2X
Business models leveraging multiple modes of C-V2X include infotainment, traffic information, real-time mapping, telematics, and data analytics. Network-based data analytics, monitoring, and opportunities also exist. While V2I might be delayed due to a lack of incentives with local governments to progress and their budget deficits, they will be significant influencers of business models, including access to services and space access.
Regulation Driven Business Models
Regulators have struggled with Big Tech, and vice versa as rapid technological advances are challenging to keep current. Regulators are important stakeholders in the autonomous driving revolution and influence players for migrating to lower pollution, less congestion, and efficient commutes.  They also must consider the transition time from human-driven to autonomous driving, factoring a period of co-existence.
The distribution of economic value will be interesting for regulators as the industry evolves. For example, if taxes are levied on miles traveled, incentives will be to stay closer to centers of action, but if taxes are driven by hours parked or space occupied, business models, will shift to minimize idle time. It will be a chicken and egg situation between industry guiding regulation and letting regulation direct the industry’s future.
Business models and profit motives will inform technology, regulatory and societal adoption of autonomous driving. This is an ecosystem play with value created outside of traditional automakers, including Technology, Media, Telecom, Insurance, Healthcare, Energy, and Government.

Integrated telematics systems enable fleet managers and field service providers to have faster response times when crashes occur, and greater visibility into driver behavior and vehicle maintenance data.
Safety is paramount for the modern fleet.
On average, 20% of commercial fleets will be involved in an accident this year due to the high number of miles they drive, according to OSHA data.
A typical motorist in the U.S. travels 12,000 to 15,000 miles annually, and each year has a 1-in-15 chance of being involved in a vehicle collision. However, most fleet drivers travel substantially more miles, resulting in even greater exposure to crash risks.
To proactively manage these risks, a growing number of commercial fleet operators and transportation logistics managers have embraced driver safety systems or dash cameras that provide a range of valuable insights into their fleet – from actionable video intelligence to vehicle risk management services that deliver detailed information about crash events in near real time.
Integrated telematics systems enable fleet managers and field service providers to have faster response times when crashes occur, and greater visibility into driver behavior and vehicle maintenance data. These data-driven, actionable insights offer a comprehensive view of vehicles and drivers throughout their routes, helping fleet operators protect drivers, fleets and their bottom line.
Video telematics mean safer fleetsOne of the best ways to ensure road and driver safety is to utilize video telematics.
A standard stream-and-store dashcam can show, after the fact, what happened during an incident, assuming a manager has time to search through the DVR footage and match it with telematics data to find the few seconds that matter.
A smart video telematics solution that combines computer vision technology, artificial intelligence and vehicle motion data provides so much more contextual insights that can directly improve safety and coaching efficiency.
While telematics can report the “what” of an incident, smarter, more integrated video technology can tell a fleet manager the “why” by providing a complete picture of what happened before, during and after an incident.
For example, when the telematics edge device identifies an inertial trigger such as harsh braking or harsh cornering, the device tells the camera to save a video clip of the event. That clip is sent to the cloud, where it can be viewed immediately or downloaded to view later. When alerted by these driving exceptions, fleet managers can focus on the incident in context without weeding through endless hours of footage.
The more inertial and vision triggers available with a video telematics solution, the better for driver coaching and overall fleet safety. Triggers can be customized to flag any speed limit and stop sign violations, tailgating, lane drift, harsh braking, acceleration and cornering, allowing organizations the freedom to choose which triggers matter most.
Managers can use these incidents to provide an immersive coaching experience to improve driver behavior and fleet-wide safety. Suddenly, driver coaching goes from cookie cutter to driver-specific, and driving behavior improves.
Conversely, safe habits can also be detected, reinforced and rewarded. Managers can implement video telematics solutions to encourage good behavior by creating driver scorecards and positive recognition programs inside fleets. With this kind of positive reinforcement, drivers actively engage in improving their statistics.
Video telematics tell the true storyThe vast majority of car-truck accidents are often the fault of the driver of the passenger car, yet many assume the commercial truck driver is in the wrong unless evidence shows otherwise.
In the absence of sophisticated video safety systems, fleet managers can spend a considerable amount of time and resources identifying the cause behind an incident, hampering their ability to protect drivers from risks such as fraudulent claims.
Fleet operators are well-insured, and in many states are strictly liable for losses caused by drivers, making them prime targets for insurance fraud. Meanwhile, nuclear verdicts (where jury penalties exceed $10 million) threaten both fleet owners and insurers.
Video telematics provides data-driven evidence that can play a crucial role when it comes to exonerating drivers and mitigating fraud. A fully integrated telematics solution can accurately detect crashes, alert operators to the event, and almost immediately upload video footage of the critical seconds before, during, and after impact.
These accurate situational details leave little room for doubt and can help companies understand the root cause of an accident. If a car slams on the brakes in front of the fleet vehicle or swerves into its lane, irrefutable video evidence can protect fleet drivers from being unfairly blamed for the event.
When cameras detect a visual trigger from another motorist on the road, drivers can prove they exercised safety protocols on the road by leveraging video evidence to exonerate themselves. Exoneration would also help operators protect a company’s reputation, and you can’t really put a price on that.
Rapid access to data-driven evidence means expedited collision investigations and faster claims processing. A more efficient claims process can lower overall fleet costs related to collisions and may also help reduce insurance premiums, all thanks to fleet telematics.
Fleet maintenance to keep vehicles safeNo matter how cautious and safe a fleet’s drivers are, ensuring overall safe operation begins with proper vehicle maintenance.
Fleet management applications that deliver a dashboard of data insights captured from a telematics device can alert fleet managers to low battery levels, excessive hours of use, engine fault lights or other potential mechanical problems that could lead to unsafe vehicles.
They can track when maintenance service is needed, enabling managers to schedule and prioritize repairs and regular maintenance checks. These customizable alerts provide fleet managers with greater visibility into vehicle operations to potentially prevent mechanical failures, keep drivers safe, and maintain vehicle uptime. Proper, timely maintenance also reduces the chances of vehicles breaking down on the side of the road, which can pose a safety threat to stranded drivers.
The bottom lineFleet managers are often forced to switch between several applications, giving them a highly fragmented view of daily operations, wasting valuable time and increasing frustration.
Fully integrated fleet management solutions provide fleets of all sizes with a unified view of their operations to manage a broader range of vehicles and drivers more effectively.
Data is only as good as the sense you can make of it. Actionable intelligence, delivered in near real time, is what moves the needle.
A fully integrated video intelligence solution gives fleet managers a competitive advantage through increased visibility of their operations. This level of visibility can open up the doors to strategically and digitally transform their operations for the long term and, ultimately, secure their role in the evolution of fleet operations.

Time loss due to traffic jams, rising levels of environmental pollution, an increasing number of fatalities, some of the many woes of urban commuting. Enter smart mobility, a solution based on the use of different modes of transportation instead of one’s personal vehicle. This concept, which runs on the use of carpooling, ridesharing, and bike commuting, has taken cities by storm. Not only that, this market is expected to grow further still though things have been going a little downhill since the advent of the pandemic.
Impact of COVID-19 on the Smart Mobility Market: An Analysis
2020 has been a grim year for all industrial sectors, especially the smart mobility market. The primary reason for the downfall of the smart mobility market can be attributed to a decline in demand for carpooling and ridesharing services across the world, owing to safety concerns.
While it is true that the market is expected to experience even slower growth during 2021, industry experts expect to see the curve rising from the year 2022 onwards. This forecast is based on the belief that adequate safety measures will be introduced for carpooling and ridesharing, such as the placement of plastic barriers between the car’s driver and its passengers.
Factors Affecting the Growth of Smart Mobility
The application of electricity to transportation and the use of carpooling are not novel concepts. In fact, the first Electric Vehicle (EV) was introduced in the US as early as 1889, and by the early 1900s, nearly one-third of the vehicles on the American streets were electricity-powered. It was not until the 1930s that cheap Texas oil made EVs a thing of the past. However, here we stand at the cusp of another golden age wherein EVs and smart mobility are bound to become an essential part of the future.
Having said that, it is natural for one to ask about the significant factors influencing the smart mobility market. The factors may either be drivers or barriers that need to be dealt with the innovation and a common purpose to turn the idea of smart mobility into a living reality.
#1 The Way People Viewed Vehicles are Changing
It was only a few decades back that owning a private car was every family’s dream. Mass production of automobiles and budget-friendly fuel prices brought this ideal within the reach of the average citizen, and as a result, vehicle-centric urban design and personal, door-to-door transportation became the norm.
Today, the scenario is much different. The present millennial-led era prefers not to own a car; instead, this young generation of commuters is shifting in favor of ridesharing services such as Uber or Lyft – they prefer to subscribe to a car-sharing service rather than bear the cost of a personal car, which includes fuel and maintenance costs. Is it any surprise that such new vehicle usage patterns will encourage the growth of the smart mobility market?
#2 Technology is Advancing at a Lightning-Fast Pace
From autonomous vehicles that are smart enough to run on their own to smart parking systems that make the tedious task of parking a piece of cake, technology is the key driver of the smart mobility market. The hyper-connectivity offered by the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G will make it easier for cities to manage traffic, cut down environmental pollution, and make better use of infrastructure. Commuters can have real-time information for smoother and safer transit.
Then, with the use of self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles and drone deliveries, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) predicts that the world may see a whopping 90% reduction in traffic deaths, a 40% reduction in travel time, and a 500% increase in lane capacity. Does it get any smarter than this!
#3 Low Rate of Internet Penetration in Developing Regions
Here’s a barrier to entry for smart mobility systems in full force. Now, the use of ridesharing services requires the involvement of three parties, namely the rider, the driver, and the service provider. The entire process of matching riders with drivers, fare estimation and ride payment are to be carried out via smartphone apps, which in turn require good internet connectivity. 
Unfortunately, some regions, such as Burundi, Chad, and Somalia, among others, have extremely low internet penetration that hinders the development of smart mobility systems in such countries. Once the proper infrastructure for connectivity has been established, the dream of smart mobility can proceed onwards.
#4 An Entirely New Infrastructure and Value Chain is Needed
As much as IoT requires proper infrastructure for connectivity, so does the use of Electric Vehicles require ubiquitous charging infrastructure. The current scenario is pretty awkward wherein potential EV drivers do not see an infrastructure that allows them to buy an EV and drive with confidence, and on the other hand, potential infrastructure providers do not see mass demand insight. Until the time charging stations become as common as gas stations are today, this one barrier-to-entry will make the adoption of EVs a far-fetched dream.
#5 Another Major Driver is Government Policies
Central, state, and city governments can join hands to speed up the adoption of smart mobility systems. Although several US state governments have already directed their focus towards measures such as tax credits and rebates to make smart mobility more affordable for early adopters and are also imposing strict vehicle emission standards for automobile manufacturers, the need of the hour is to offer exclusive EV parking in congested areas, and establishment of ZEZs or Zero Emission Zones wherein traffic will be restricted to bikes, pedestrians, delivery vehicles, and electric vehicles – measures already in place by the city governments of London, Brussels, Paris, and Madrid. Such government policies are sure to accelerate the growth of the smart mobility market.
Top Companies Expected to Dominate the Smart Mobility Market
To create technologically evolved smart mobility solutions, companies need to come up with products that are developed from a long-term market perspective as opposed to short-term creations. This is because as the smart mobility market is set in stone and matures, consumers will naturally demand integrated solutions – a mix of travel services with ancillary services.
As of now, the following companies are expected to take the lead in the future smart mobility market –
CiscoMaaS Global OySiemensTomTom InternationalInnoviz Technologies Inc.Toyota Motor CorporationFord Motor Company, among others.
Despite its present sluggish growth, smart mobility will be a factor in customer preference, changing the way people travel. It’s only a matter of time before this service model comes to the mainstream, and come it will, reaching its projected growth of $70.46 billion by the year 2027.

It is hard to believe that cars really haven’t been a part of human existence all that long. The first one hit the road in the late 1800s. The idea of every family having a vehicle as an essential component of their lives didn’t really become a reality until after World War II.
Early vehicles would be hardly recognizable today; all lacked safety features we take for granted and most were very bare-bones machines.
Fast forward to today and car technology is advancing so quickly it can be hard to keep up. Safety features such as airbags and seatbelts are standard, but new features such as forward collision warning and auto braking are becoming mainstream. Likewise, numerous sensors, bells, and whistles help us keep our machines running smoothly and cushions or heated seats help us ride in comfort on any journey.
Perhaps the most exciting aspect of new cars today is the technology. Tech is pushing the boundaries of what we expect in our vehicles from a safety standpoint as well as from an entertainment one. The advancements on the horizon are things that were unthinkable in the past and, in some ways, things we hardly dare to believe now. 
A Smart Car
These days, the technologies that come in our vehicles are not only important selling points, but they are downright clever advances.
One of the big things many people have come to expect in their vehicles is connectivity. A connection to the internet and connections to smartphones are hot-button advancements in most newer models. These smartphone connections allow for all sorts of things, from playing music wirelessly to tracking your teenager’s whereabouts through an app.
Other smart technologies that are becoming mainstream features in our cars are those that have to deal with safety. Many manufacturers now offer some form of advanced driver-assist systems in their vehicles. This can mean a lot of things, but the gist is that driver assist offers features that take some of the effort out of driving and, in theory, enhance safety. Advanced driver-assist systems can include things like:
Lane departure warnings.Adaptive cruise control.Automatic emergency braking.Blindspot alerts.Assisted parking.Reverse braking assistance.Exit warning systems.
So far, drivers are having mixed reactions to the advanced driver-assist functions. Some people are eager to do less in their vehicles, while others would rather maintain control and not have to worry about a car feature kicking in while they are doing something slightly technical like parallel parking.
AAA has also found mixed results in actual safety benefits, warning that the technologies are still in the early stages of development and becoming too dependent upon them can lead to problems.
Self-Driving Coming Soon?
Arguably the biggest advancement that many people are looking forward to is the introduction of the self-driving car. Hype for these cars appears to have its ebbs and flows, but many think the technology is on the verge of becoming a reality. It could be something that many of us start seeing in the next couple of decades and our grandchildren may never even know what it is like to actually drive a car.
There are certainly pros and cons to the technologies that come with self-driving vehicles. Many advocates argue that self-driving vehicles have the potential to greatly reduce driving accidents and deaths. They say the tech has the potential to take out the human error factor, which can cause over 90% of serious accidents. 
Advocates also point to a number of other benefits including things like accessibility and environmental impacts. Self-driving cars mean that anyone can jump in a vehicle and go somewhere; they eliminate boundaries for those that are unable to drive. Additionally, advocates point to data suggesting that self-driving vehicles could reduce traffic jams and increase fuel efficiencies, which would be a benefit from an environmental standpoint.
Cybersecurity Concerns
Many of these technological advancements offer a great means of increasing safety and making car travel even more convenient and enjoyable. However, there are some inherent risks associated with the tech. For one, extensive technology in vehicles opens the door for cybersecurity concerns.
Connective technologies that are essential for things like self-driving vehicles mean that your car is connected to a much larger grid. Much like connecting your computer to the internet, a gridded car connection exposes vehicles to the potential for hacking. It’s hard to say what could happen, but hackers that are able to gain access to a vehicle could have control over acceleration, braking, radio, and other technologies.
Fortunately, this is a risk that many experts are aware of and are actively trying to combat. Many companies are developing software that will allow them to identify when a hack is occurring and combat it rapidly across the country. Some experts think there may need to be features that allow vehicles to be transferred back to owner control in these instances.
Advancements in vehicle tech are happening faster than many of us are able to keep up with. New entertainment and safety tech such as advanced driver-assist systems are considered precursors to self-driving cars. Though these new technologies are exciting, there are still a number of risks, including cybersecurity vulnerabilities, that need to be worked out before they are really ready to hit the road.

When the technology press talks about the supply chain of the future, it tends to focus on some of the clichés that, while they spark the imagination, tend to veer closer to science fiction than reality.
For logistics and deliveries, there are often mentions of self-driving trucks or drones that can handle last-mile delivery. For depots, distributions, and warehouses, the images are ones of massive aircraft-hangar-sized warehouses without a human soul on site, entirely staffed by robots.
To a certain extent, there are some elements of truth in these visions. Robots do play an increasing part in many warehouses across the world, and while driverless trucks are still safely in testing stages, entire worldwide fleets of all types of transport are carefully tracked and scheduled by advanced technologies.
In practical terms, many challenges face supply chain and logistics managers today that can and are being solved by technology. This series of articles hopes to describe some of the more exciting solutions, and focus on the ones that make practical business sense in 2021. Issues like peaks in demand over national festivals and shopping events, the need to dramatically cut carbon emissions to keep delivery trucks rolling through many of the world’s cities: these are among the many issues that concern supply chain professionals today.
Iterate to improve
Day-to-day operations require changes that create little-and-often improvements. These improvements are then reflected in today’s businesses’ order books and finance software, from those of ocean-going freight operators through bike delivery outfits. In this series of articles, we hope to look at some of the more practical technology-based solutions that make significant differences in several areas of the supply chain and logistics industry.
As an area of technological evolution, our vertical is particularly exciting because of its interconnected nature. Change and improvements in one niche area, like improvements in loading bay metrics, can cause an increased need for improvement in digital connectivity further up and down the chain. As an integrated and organic system, the supply chain, and the elements in it, are an area that is one to watch for anyone with an interest in how technologies are changing business.
For the operations manager in any business anywhere in the supply chain, keeping tabs on the rest of the industry is very necessary: changes to platforms, practices and protocols will indubitably have their effects felt close to home, sooner or later.
In this opening article, we’ll be considering four technical innovators in the industry, vendors whose solutions and practical offerings will make that significant difference to operations. From vehicle fleet management, through picking and warehouse robots, to integration with varying government Customs APIs for import/export, to e-commerce platforms — the intermeshed supply chains and logistics networks that cover the globe are a hotbed of technological innovation.
Here is our opening salvo of four vendors: these are the movers and shakers in this hotbed of technology that is the supply chain of the modern age.
GEEK+
Smart logistics solutions are what Geek+ delivers all over the world today. Right now, its robots and control systems create automations across facility shop floors that drive efficiency, increase the flexibility of the supply chain, and lower costs. The cut in labor costs is significant, and so are reductions in associated overheads caused by mistakes, accidents, and holdups from any source.
Throughout seasonal peaks and troughs of consumer demand, Geek+ platform continues to adapt and provide solutions across the multiple industries, including e-commerce, retail, 3PL, pharmaceutical, and more.
The solution creates technology infrastructure that can pre-emptively adjust the supply chain according to prevailing conditions — that’s down to the information flows that happen in real-time. Day-to-day operations are revolutionized, the business becomes more agile, and its partners benefit too.
Planning and facilitating real-time events can become a fully automated process, with robotized pickers and warehouse robots maximizing capacity on the fly, ensuring human operators work more productively and safely. The Geek+ advantage is one of being able to be proactive rather than reactive to business. It offers modernization of facilities; via the platform, the positive effects spread out across the enterprise through synchronized data and visibility of information silos with benefits beyond the supply chain, allowing the whole business to thrive.

GEOTAB
As a global leader in IoT and connected transportation with over 2.2 million connected vehicles, Geotab provides advanced data insights and fleet management solutions to organizations all over the world, including thousands of logistics companies.

Even small details like vehicle movements across depots or yards can yield powerful information that help increase management’s visibility and enable data-driven insights to change operations for the better.
Geotab’s innovations are centered around six pillars: Productivity, Fleet Optimization, Safety, Compliance, Expandability and most recently, Sustainability. These pillars are strategically selected to ensure that the customers’ business remains relevant in a world that is experiencing rapid social, economic, environmental and technological change.

ANCHANTO
Anchanto’s solution was born and bred in Asia, and its multilingual support on the platform (customizable for each user) means it’s the go-to in the APAC for many in the industry. The GUI transitions neatly and clearly from English through Japanese, Mandarin, Bahasa, among others, and provides oversight and management of inventory, order, pricing, and discrete catalogs.
The Anchanto solutions also “speak computer,” integrating via open-standard APIs into other enterprise systems. Companies can tie together logistics, supply chain, and, for instance, internal finance, HR, and CRM systems. Even outside the company’s logistics operations, staff feel the benefits, as previously manual copying & pasting from one system to another gets fully automated.
The Anchanto eCommerce management system (SelluSeller) integrates with 70+ marketplaces common in the region, from niche specialists up to the giants: the likes of Lazada, Flipkart, and Tmall. It handles ordering and fulfillment processes from marketplaces and other websites — including your own e-commerce facilities — and then co-ordinates the supply chain for a fully inclusive service that puts customers’ experiences first.
For warehousing and stock control, the Wareo platform handles stock expiry dates, SKU lists, re-ordering, consignment notes, delivery orders, and so on – the list is long enough that it’s best read on the company’s website!

FLEXPORT
Flexport’s mainstay offering is around all things sea-going and ocean freight forwarding. Full load shipments and multi-port partial loads are tracked, either being carried the company’s own network of vessels or across the common major shipping alliances. That means exceptions (so much part of ocean freight) can be immediately acted on, with operations staff alerted via the highly customizable dashboard that gives a literal worldwide view of real-time activities.
This type of insight plays a critical role in a connected supply chain for companies bound by SLAs or those on a journey to improve metrics and customer experiences. To push this goal more effectively and reduce costs for all its clients, Flexport offers partners container-space-to-requirement matching service. When there’s unused space, it can be offered to other Flexport clients, helping both parties achieve better efficiency and slash consignment costs.
The Flexport solution integrates with truck and air logistics, too, with a highly extensible system that boasts fully ready-to-go APIs for inter-connectivity. There is also a customs and duties facilitation service, which means companies get direct electronic access to filing and rebate systems right across the world. That feature alone saves literally hundreds of hours spent filing paper records with multiple agencies.

 Expected Biden administration infrastructure initiatives, combined with favorable autonomous vehicle (AV) regulatory and testing environments in the U.S. are expected to spur AV deployments 
 By Pär-Olof Johannesson 
Over the past decade, the United States of America has paved the way for an autonomous driving future. In addition to steps already taken by industry, academic and the U.S. Department of Transportation, President-elect Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan bodes well for the autonomous vehicle industry.
Crucial YearsThe next four years under the Biden administration could prove crucial to the nation’s ability to lead the autonomous driving race, but also increase road safety throughout the country. The two issues are not unrelated.
As America works to “build back better,” road safety needs to be taken into account. Road traffic injuries have been the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5-29 years and the eighth leading cause of deaths globally. Given that 95% of all road accidents are due to human error, prioritizing advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) vehicles can get the country to a safer place. Furthermore, while COVID-19 has crippled other markets, the pandemic has served to tighten the focus on the importance of self-driving cars, with many viewing driverless deliveries as a safer alternative, allowing robotaxi companies such as AutoX to secure a renewed wave of support.
U.S. Uniquely PositionedThe U.S. is uniquely positioned to succeed in the ADAS testing space. Its infrastructure makes it ideal for holding trial runs for self-driving vehicles. Compared with Europe’s tight infrastructure, North America’s wide and sweeping highways are optimal for testing large-scale driverless vehicles.
Though both regions still must update existing infrastructure to incorporate AV specific enhancements, such as staging areas, charging stations and inspection locations, North America simply has more space than Europe. In addition, the U.S. also has options for large-scale testing facilities like the University of Michigan’s Mcity. 
Biden and an Autonomous FutureBiden has signaled that his administration will prioritize infrastructure, which could prove favorable to the AV industry. His plan also emphasizes the importance of EVs, and the U.S.’s deployment of fuel-efficient cars and trucks can only help the ADAS space, as most autonomous vehicles will be electrically powered.
Similarly, poor road maintenance is one of the most consistent challenges driverless cars face. Biden’s focus on road repair, in addition to promising developments in self-repairing smart concrete, could allow for a smoother transition to autonomous driving.
Favorable Regulatory EnvironmentEven without the pending Biden administration, the transportation regulatory environment in the U.S. is decidedly more favorable than Europe’s to the transportation industry, and this has consequences. For example, carmaker Audi has expressed its frustrations with European ADAS testing regulations, especially in comparison with their U.S. counterparts. It should be noted, however, that as of mid 2022, all new cars put on the EU market are required to be equipped with ADAS features, setting the continent up for faster large-scale deployment than the U.S.
With less red tape around securing appropriate permits, it is far easier to set up testing sites on American soil. Long gone are the days where California served as the country’s lone test site. A number of states are jumping on the testing bandwagon ranging from the SunTrax Testing Facility in Florida to a rollout of potential Walmart delivery trucks in Arizona.

As of this year, 45 out of 50 U.S. states have taken it upon themselves to enact AV-related legislation.

Standards, TooFurther, the Department of Transportation (DOT) has already shown willingness to establish self-driving standards. Just earlier this month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began soliciting public comments to standardize safety protocols for driverless vehicles. So while this initiative began under President Donald Trump, federal guidelines will certainly come to fruition under Biden.
States Leading the AV chargeRegardless of who is in the Oval Office, individual states have been making significant strides in autonomous driving on their own. Between Silicon Valley and Waymo’s rollout in California to Boston Dynamics shaking up the tech scene in Massachusetts, autonomous systems have made headway from coast to coast.
As of this year, 45 out of 50 U.S. states have taken it upon themselves to enact AV-related legislation. Even Nevada has gotten in on the action with Motional’s pending rollout. It is clear that the states have prioritized autonomous driving and will continue to do so, regardless of federal guidance.
China – Opportunities and ChallengesIt comes as no surprise that the Chinese market could provide American ADAS makers with a wealth of consumers. But it is important to not let trade conflicts with China impede future success.
The size of China’s market alone is enough to convince any business to target its consumers, but it also helps that they are more open to driverless vehicles, according to a recent study from Deloitte.
As of 2020, only 35% of Chinese respondents stated that they do not think self-driving cars are safe, in comparison with 48% of Americans. Similarly, U.S. residents have been slower to change their attitudes as a whole, with the percentage consistently wavering between 47% and 50% in the past three years, unlike countries such as Japan, which have seen more significant changes in perception.
China’s focus on 5G wireless network infrastructure and smart cities may allow for vehicles with ADAS to hit the roads en masse far ahead of the U.S. timeline. Not only would this potentially position China for a faster rollout, but it would also have an edge when it comes to statewide integration. While the U.S. lags in 5G infrastructure, China’s 5G focus may ultimately enable autonomous vehicles to take the road using a 5G transportation grid with a more standardized approach.
In terms of China’s access to the U.S., even Chinese companies have taken notice of the U.S.’s unparalleled access to potential test sites. Some Chinese automakers that do not produce or sell cars in the U.S. have licenses to test self-driving cars in California. In short, both the U.S. and China would lose valuable investment opportunities should ongoing trade conflicts persist. But with China continuing to thrive in the industry, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more crucial than ever that the U.S. has access to this market.

At the end of the day, over 1.35 million people around the world lose their lives each year to driving related accidents.

StandardizatonWith this in mind, one of the most important aspects of an autonomous future is standardization. Of course, that applies to a standardization of regulations across the U.S. and the world. But more importantly, it also applies to a standardization of the technology used in these vehicles across North America, Europe, and Asia. At the end of the day, over 1.35 million people around the world lose their lives each year to driving related accidents. If we want to ensure a faster road to autonomous driving and a truly safer future, we need to take industrial and scientific collaboration on standardized regulations and technologies seriously.

WE WERE PROMISED SELF-DRIVING CARS before the end of the last decade, and those predictions are turning out to be wildly, hilariously wrong. But things may be catching up — and the loser of the pack, according to Sam Abuelsamid of Guidehouse Insights, is Tesla, which may surprise droves of Elon-stans.
“Of course there is also the elephant in the room that is Tesla,” Abuelsamid tells Inverse. “To be honest, I’m not sure they really belong in this group at all, but the company and CEO have been so insistent that they are developing ‘full self-driving’ … and they get most of the attention from media and financial markets that I felt they should be here just to demonstrate where they actually stand.”
It’s not as if it’s been an easy road for anyone involved in the autonomous industry. We’re firmly in the trough of disillusionment as autonomous car companies bite the dust, are scooped up by well-funded competitors, or simply take much longer to reach fruition than we thought.
The Trough of Disillusionment is part of something called the Gartner Hype Cycle, and it follows the Peak of Inflated Expectations. Remember that? Back in the mid-2010s, when Uber and Google were going to launch robotaxis in every city around the world, and before we knew it, the streets would be safer and greener, and then all those predictions turned out to be total bunk.
But never fear, the hype cycle of overpromising and underdelivering and dashed hopes and sunken dreams has a happy ending. Though many companies remain cautious, we’ve seen real progress in the self-driving car world over the past year, according to Abuelsamid.
One thing is different this year, however. “For the first time, the focus is on the companies developing the automated driving systems rather than those that will deploy the technology on the road,” he says. “Thus we have Argo AI instead of Ford and VW and Aurora instead of Uber or Toyota.”
Unless you’re a serious autonomous car buff, it’s likely that you won’t recognize most of the names listed, but you will, soon enough. Here’s a look at the leaders from the 2021 Guidehouse Insights Leaderboard.
Guidehouse Insights
TESLA HAS THE HYPE (AND THE MONEY)
To say that the report is critical of Tesla is underselling it a little bit. Not only does Tesla score at the bottom of the pile when it comes to execution, but it’s also even further behind on strategy.
“Tesla’s approach to testing its system is fundamentally at odds with virtually every other company in this industry,” claims the report, which is available in full for $3,950 on the Guidehouse Insights website. Regardless of what Elon Musk claims, Tesla explicitly says in its operating instructions that “Full-Self Driving” requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel, ready to take control at all times.
“The hands-on, eyes-on requirement essentially makes FSD a driver assist system not covered by California rules and allows Tesla to market the system as more than it is,” says the report.
It’s not all bad. The report points out that Tesla has staying power, despite being close to bankruptcy several times over the years. The world’s leading electric car maker was recently worth an eye-watering $800 billion — that’s more than the next eight most valuable automakers combined. Tesla took the opportunity to sell an additional $10 billion in stock, raising valuable capital to buy itself a lot of additional runway and the cash to build several new gigafactories around the world.
Still, the Guidehouse Insights report pulls no punches:
“Tesla needs a thorough rethink of its approach to developing ADS. It has overpromised with its marketing for nearly 5 years and severely underdelivered. Until Tesla is more honest it is unlikely to improve in the rankings of this Leaderboard.”
4. THE CHINESE UPSTART: BAIDU
Baidu is the leading Chinese autonomous technology company, sporting partnerships with many companies, including Volkswagen, BMW, Ford, and a host of Chinese carmakers. It’s operating test flights without safety operators in both Beijing and California, and it has the most extensive development fleet in China.
Its Apollo system is comprehensive, utilizing “lidar, radar, and camera sensors along with cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communications all running on a custom-designed compute platform,” says Guidehouse. “Baidu already provides a range of communication, mapping, and streaming services to automakers in the Chinese market and is building on that base for its ADS (autonomous driving systems) ambitions.”
It’s well-positioned with a wide-ranging software stack but could use more hardware partners to maximize its growth opportunities in the crowded (but booming) Chinese autonomous driving market.
3. WHERE COMPETITORS COME TOGETHER: ARGO AI
While it might seem odd for competitors to invest together, lower-level autonomous technology isn’t necessarily the differentiator you might think it is. That’s why both Ford and Volkswagen have invested billions in Argo AI, the third-highest scoring company on the Guidehouse leaderboard.
“VW plans to launch its first product with Argo in 2023 using the production version of the electric ID Buzz minivan as a platform,” says Guidehouse. At the same time, Ford is working on an autonomous vehicle based on its new Escape hybrid crossover.
The report specifically calls out Argo’s testing on highways in Miami. “Highway driving capability will enable Argo-powered AVs to expand operating domains to more areas of the regions they serve,” says the report. It does note that Argo AI has not shown off its autonomous tech with public ride testing as Waymo has.
2. NOT JUST FOR CRYPTO AND CRYSIS: NVIDIA
GPU-maker Nvidia is one of the leaders in both autonomous hardware and software. The tech that makes its GPUs effective for crypto mining also makes it highly effective for neural network processing and autonomous vehicles.
“In addition to hardware, Nvidia has developed a relatively complete ADS software stack that encompasses everything needed including signal processing, perception, driving policy, and control elements,” explains the Guidehouse report. The Nvidia Drive hardware platform is rather dominant in the industry. Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler has chosen Nvidia’s Orin system on a chip and its software stack to build its next-generation electric architecture upon.
1. WHICH WAY TO WAYMO?
While it might be a surprise that Tesla is at the bottom of the rankings, the company on top shouldn’t be. Waymo, a spin-off from Google, launched fully autonomous rides for members of the public at its pilot program in Chandler, Arizona without a safety driver on board. That’s something that no other company has been able to do, aside from extremely limited trials.
Both Volvo and Stellantis (née Fiat Chrysler) have selected Waymo’s platform to power their future Level 4 self-driving vehicles, and it’s now on its fifth-generation autonomous driving stack with new, lower-cost sensors. Waymo plans both an expansion of its fully autonomous ridesharing service that is piloting in Arizona and an autonomous delivery service that will use vans from Stellantis.
Early last year, Waymo raised its first external round of financing that didn’t come solely from Alphabet/Google. “The decision to take outside investment is believed to be related to the recognition that broad deployment of AVs is not imminent,” says the Guidehouse report. “The new investment gives Waymo additional runway to grow revenue and reach profitability while reducing the spending by Alphabet.”
There’s a good chance your first ride in an autonomous robotaxi might be in a Waymo vehicle.
0. THEN THERE’S EVERYONE ELSE
The list goes on and on. Just about every legacy carmaker has invested in one or more ADS companies. And each ADS company seems to have at least one carmaker (if not more) invested in it.
While preventing vehicle crashes is a primary driver of advanced self-driving tech, it’s far from the only motivator. Driving down the cost of transportation (a self-driving Uber doesn’t need health insurance benefits and potty breaks like a human driver might) and reducing congestion are all significant factors as we look towards the city of tomorrow.
We’re still a few years away from reaching the Plateau of Productivity at the end of the hype cycle, so there’s plenty of time for both new and existing players to leap to the forefront. Still, it seems like things are about to get exciting again in the world of self-driving tech.

A lot of cyberattacks originate on network perimeters and are being carried out by software programs that look for easy targets.
Transportation companies are more susceptible than ever to cyberattacks after a tumultuous year shifted the attention of employees in many different directions. People who have the primary responsibility of keeping companies safe are seeing a difficult road ahead.
Cybersecurity is a problem that will never go away, and in response, some transportation companies have given a person, or a department, the duties of chief information security officer (CISO) to enforce IT policies for connectivity among employees, customers and vendors.
With or without a CISO role, all companies have similar needs for tightening their defenses. Barry Lance, network administrator for AIM Transportation Solutions, compares his defense strategy to the rings of an onion. It will take a layered approach to have any chance for success.
Thwarting phishing attempts
The outermost ring should focus on the types of threats that can most easily infiltrate a computer network, said Lance. These include drive-by downloaders and phishing, a type of malware that uses email as a vehicle to get users to click on links and enter login credentials, among other information.
Most phishing attempts can be thwarted by training employees to recognize suspicious emails, he said. Girard, Ohio-based AIM (CCJ Top 250, No. 152) operates a full-service equipment leasing business with more than 12,000 power units and dedicated fleets for shipper customers.
Polaris Transport, a less-than-truckload carrier based in Toronto with more than 120 trucks, uses preventive measures to block phishing email attempts. The company’s email system is configured to automatically quarantine the most suspicious emails. Less suspicious emails are identified with a header, including emails that come from external servers, like Hotmail, that do not have a prerequisite transport layer security (TLS).
“Our people pick it up,” said Dave Brajkovich, chief information officer. If tagged emails are legitimate, employees will notify the senders about the potential vulnerabilities of their email system. 
Securing the perimeter
The second layer of Lance’s onion is focused on preventing outer-layer threats that occur on the perimeter of a network, such as port scanning on firewalls. This is a more difficult area to identify attacks, since a lot of the activity that takes place on the perimeter today is being done automatically by software programs looking for easy targets.
Small and medium-sized fleets have a more difficult time affording the advanced systems they need to monitor network traffic and detect possible intrusions.Lance said he uses software programs that monitor port utilization on network switches to look for traffic anomalies, particularly those that occur after normal business hours. His methodology pays special attention to messages that are moving in or out of AIM’s email domain to prevent attacks from reaching workstations and servers further downstream.
“The trick for me right now is to create a mechanism to provide real-time alerting of these violations out to IT staff without creating alert fatigue for them,” he said.
The last line of defense is to protect workstations and servers. Here, at the center of the onion, Lance said his focus is preventing specific types of threats by setting group policies for user access, and by monitoring for account lockouts, password changes, and security group membership changes.
To thwart more advanced types of cyberattacks on the network perimeter, Polaris is using a monitoring tool from Splunk that identifies possible infiltration attempts. Even the most advanced systems cannot predict when or where an attack will be made.
“Proactiveness is something that doesn’t really exist when it comes to security,” said Ted de Vos, president of Simnet, based in the Toronto area, which provides managed IT services for Polaris Transport. “You can’t proactively monitor but you can reactively monitor everything.”
The Splunk system monitors for different signs that trigger an event to manage. Examples of trigger events include a change in web traffic on a certain port that are combined with data transfers and a failed login. “Together that is an event, and it is what Splunk gives us,” de Vos said.
Insights from Splunk are used to build risk analysis models based on different types of events that can occur. Simnet is using about 20 models to monitor for events at Polaris.
Halvor Lines, a dry van and flatbed carrier based in Superior, Wis. (CCJ Top 250, No. 168), also uses a system that monitors network switches, routers and ports to spot suspicious trends, said Brett Corlett, systems engineer.
Small and medium-sized fleets have a difficult time affording more advanced systems to monitor network traffic, he said, which continue to become more necessary to spot and thwart cyberattacks.
The level of sophistication for cyberattacks is increasing. Many attacks are being done today with automated programs that use artificial intelligence to quickly find vulnerabilities and breach computer networks.
“It’s scary and keeps me up at night,” Corlett added, “and it’s never going to end.”

Transportation is one of the fastest changing and most exciting sectors in the global economy today. Connected and autonomous vehicles, shared mobility concepts, and the shift to electric vehicles are some of the most exciting avenues. Increasingly, the acronym, “CASE,” which stands for Connectivity, Autonomous, Sharing/Subscription and Electrification is being used to refer to this shift.
At a dedicated session on the “Future of Mobility” at the 2020 ARC Industry Forum in Orlando, Florida, four leaders in the mobility space joined us to share their perspectives and experiences around the CASE transition.
Shortcomings in Today’s Transport System
To start the session, ARC Advisory Group summarized some of the shortcomings of the current transportation system based on statistics from the US government and other sources:
There are 275 million cars on US roads, for an adult population of 250 millionThose cars have an average occupancy rate of just 1.59 peopleMost cars in the US remain parked well over 90 percent of the timeNearly 40,000 Americans die on our roads each year, mostly due to human errorOf the 200,000 annual US deaths from air pollution, 50,000 are the result of vehicle tailpipe emissionsThe transport sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the economyWorkers in the US lose over thirty billion hours and nearly $90 billion to traffic congestionUS cities are mostly built for cars – with pedestrians and urban life superseded by roads and parking spaces
These issues are driven by a century-old paradigm: the use of private, low-occupancy fossil fuel-powered vehicles for nearly every journey, operated by error-prone, and increasingly distracted, human drivers.
Addressing the issues requires changing the paradigm.
A previous Forum session focused on the shift to electric powertrains, which can help mitigate the human health and environmental impacts of our transport system.  Here, we focus on mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) and connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology.  These key elements in this new paradigm offer the potential to radically improve road safety and free up non-value-added time spent driving and sitting in traffic.
What Is Mobility as a Service?
The next presentation, by Pete Costello, SVP at Iteris, a global leader in smart mobility infrastructure management, discussed the broad need for transportation, stressing its centrality to the global economy and our ever-rising standard of living. He then introduced the MaaS concept, as well as its genesis under Sampo Hietanen, industry founder and current CEO of MaaS Global (readers can hear our subsequent interview with Mr. Hietanen on the Smart Cities Podcast).
Mr. Costello explained that the mission of MaaS is to reduce the prevalence of single-occupancy vehicles to help lower pollution, increase vehicle utilization rates, and improve the human experience through “multimodal and sustainable mobility services addressing customers’ transportation needs by integrating planning and payment on a one-stop-shop principle.”
The idea is for a customer to be able to conveniently and flexibly access whatever transportation mode, or combination of modes, is needed to get to where he or she needs to go.
Possible Business Models
A customer would be presented with multiple journey options, along with their respective expected journey times, environmental footprint, calories burned, and so on.
They could pay per journey, or via a subscription. According to Mr. Costello, the subscription model emerged from an observation that for private vehicle owners in Western countries the “true cost of mobility is approximately $700-$800 per month” when vehicle maintenance, fuel, insurance, deductibles, parking, citations, inspections, government registration, taxes, and other costs are considered.  This does not include time spent at the service station, government offices, and the occasional towing yard.
Given this, a MaaS subscription providing full access to transport at a monthly cost below the private car’s true cost of mobility could prove attractive. Mobility packages with various price points and access levels may also have a role, as different customers will have different mobility needs. MaaS Global introduced its Whim app in Helsinki in 2017 and has found early success. The different plans available to Whim users in Helsinki are shown below.
Challenges for MaaS
Though MaaS holds real promise for urban mobility, it still faces plenty of challenges.
Providing access to any combination of modes through a single app requires integration with providers of different modes (ride-hail, transit, car rental, etc.) each with their own business and data processes, into a unified mobility operation, which then interacts with the customer. As Mr. Costello explained, “This is where we want to be, but it’s hard to get there. All the different entities involved are siloed, and not just in their services but their data – the accuracy of that data, its frequency, some of it real time, some of it static. How do you put that all together?”
Beyond the technical challenges, drivers are usually not aware of their true cost of mobility. This is because most costs associated with car ownership are payed relatively infrequently, while the cost of a ride-share or e-scooter is presented with every ride.
Another challenge lies in “car pride,” a concept introduced by MIT researchers studying mobility systems worldwide. According to the researchers, “The car fulfills not only instrumental transportation functions, but also holds important symbolic and affective meaning for its owners and users. In particular, owning and using a car can be a symbol of an individual’s social status or personal image.”
Lastly, since a mobility service consists of a menu of transport modes, the entire service suffers when one of these is lacking.  This means adequate public infrastructure, effective transit, and safe bike lanes are needed to make MaaS work well.
Beep’s Autonomous Shuttle Service
Our next presenter, Clayton Tino, CTO of Florida autonomous shuttle service operator Beep, argued that the future of mobility is not only shared, but also electric and, increasingly, driver-free.
The Human Factors
With the potential to reduce accidents and lower mobility costs, vehicle autonomy is an exciting element of the CASE transition. That said, introducing robot cars to the general public is untested ground. Beep’s fleet of shuttles is entirely autonomous (and electric). Having provided over 14,000 rides in a matter of months, the company has gained valuable experience in the human side of autonomy.
Having a person on board the shuttle is currently a legal requirement where Beep operates.  According to Mr. Tino, the company found the practice is also quite useful to make the passengers feel comfortable and explain all the quirks of an autonomous vehicle (AV).  He likened this to a high-tech version of early elevator operators.
Mr. Tino went on to say that the “human factors involved are huge. It’s not just the vehicle control system itself but it’s how you plan, how you account for how other vehicles and other road users interact with your service.”
The first passengers were early adopters excited about the technology, followed later by the broader community. Beep has received mostly positive feedback according to Mr. Tino, though not without bumps: “We’re starting to see more of those people becoming comfortable with the idea of autonomy. Where we’re still trying to make inroads is the other drivers in the community.  People aren’t used to interacting with AVs on the roadway…we have displays on the vehicle to tell other drivers exactly what the vehicle is doing: slowing down, stopping, turning left.”
He went on to describe continuing challenges for AV operators in adeptly interacting with disabled, elderly, and hearing or visually impaired riders, especially when the human operator is no longer present in the future.
Other Challenges
Mr. Tino cited some other challenges for AVs.  These include the still-developing sophistication of self-driving software and high vehicle costs, which are mostly driven by the price of the sensor suite. Beyond technology, he noted that the lack of standardized safety validation process from the federal government results in the company having to comply with piecemeal regulation that varies from one jurisdiction to the next.
In the panel discussion that followed, one panelist mentioned that someday autonomous operation will be just boring. Mr. Tino responded, “If one day it’s boring that means we’ve done something very right because things are going really well.”
Autonomous System Testing
Our next presenter was Professor Harish Chintakunta from the Advanced Mobility Institute at Florida Polytechnic Institute. His group tests autonomous systems.  In his talk, he argued that autonomous vehicles are necessary to reduce motor accidents, but this transition must be implemented properly. Dr. Chintakunta notes that we tolerate significant human error on roads but will accept a far lower accident rate from AVs and public opinion can easily turn away from them.
Autonomous vehicles rely on sensors, including cameras, radar, and lidar, to see their environment. According to Dr. Chintakunta, this is where the long list of unknowns begins for mass AV adoption. “In the future let’s say if all vehicles have lidar, there’s a heavy concentration of lasers in that area, so we don’t know what the result will be.  If a single test vehicle is working properly, it may happen that multiple vehicles may not work properly.”
Ethical Questions
Sensor data is collected and then processed by the vehicle’s algorithms.  These must make sometimes-critical choices, introducing difficult questions that extend beyond the realm of engineering. “When you’re talking about algorithms, you also want to test whether they take into consideration ethical issues…so there’s all sorts of ethical issues when it comes to autonomous systems, for example do you want your vehicle to save passengers or pedestrians? If you have a chance to save three people by swerving and hitting another person, do you want to do that?”
Other ethical questions arise as well. When autonomous taxis compete as mobility services aiming to maximize passenger time, will they be programmed to travel quickly (and with higher risk) when empty to pick up the next fare sooner?
According to Dr. Chintakunta, “We don’t want to be making decisions on what’s ethical as testers, we leave that to regulators and system designers, but we want to provide a mechanism for them to encode these aspects into the testing process.”
Human Machine Interaction
Lastly, Dr. Chintakunta introduced the element of human-AV communication and how machines will interact with the language of driving that we all use without thinking much about it. “There may be situations when your turn signal isn’t working, and you may put your hand out the window. Can an autonomous vehicle understand that? We have all these implicitly understood notions, so we have to start formalizing them and build a language and evaluate how systems are dealing with this.”

Logistics leaders say lack of visibility, automation, and innovative technology is keeping them from optimizing last-mile delivery demands.
More than half of respondents to a recent industry survey say they will add automation to meet growing last-mile delivery volumes, with many pointing to outdated technology as a roadblock to delivering on last-mile promises.
Technology vendor Bringg surveyed 200 logistics professionals at companies with 200 to 50,000 employees for its State of Last Mile Logistics report, released this week. The survey polled workers in North America and Western Europe and found that the growth of e-commerce, customer expectations, and rising last-mile delivery volumes have created a capacity problem that logistics providers are struggling to fill.
More than 60% of respondents said they have seen increased demand for last-mile delivery, but noted that a lack of visibility, automation, and innovative technology is “holding them back” from meeting those demands, according to the survey. More than 40% said their biggest challenge to scaling last-mile operations is outdated business processes and manual operations, followed by legacy technology (36%).
“This past year has forced retailers and service providers to assess their supply chain agility and resilience,” Guy Bloch, Bringg CEO, said in a statement. “While they want to take advantage of growing opportunities in the world of ecommerce, they are challenged by legacy systems, limited visibility and high operational costs.”Key findings indicate a greater emphasis on tech tools for the last-mile:
53% of respondents said their shippers use or have requested real-time visibility tools for end customers, but just 18% of providers have it—and more than half said they have no plans to purchase those tools.54% of logistics providers said they are focused on adding automation to improve customer service; 41% said they have already done so.20% of respondents said they’ve abandoned automated scheduling and self-scheduling because it was too expensive, but 61% said this was the top wish-list item from shippers.64% said they are planning to offer new premium services and service plans to increase business through last-mile operations this year, while 43% said intelligent and easy integrations that enable multiple delivery models is the technology that will most help them win business.

Wise Systems developed an automated route planning and execution system for last-mile fleets to optimize the delivery experience for their customers.
Investments in the last-mile transportation and logistics sector have been soaring for companies that are not directly competing with the delivery models of UPS, FedEx and the United States Postal Service.
One of the hottest commodities in the last-mile sector has been the same-day delivery of food, beverage and grocery items. Since 2011, funding for crowdsourced delivery platforms such as Instacart and Uber Eats reached $14 billion, according to Deloitte research.
Other fast growing segments include big and bulky freight deliveries and items with extra-sensitive service requirements like medical samples and supplies.
No matter the freight type, delivery expectations in the last-mile sector are driven by Amazon, which currently fulfills 72% of orders for Prime customers within 24 hours.
The defining moment in Amazon’s last-mile strategy was its 2018 launch of the Delivery Service Partner (DSP) program. Since then, Amazon has been contracting with local delivery companies to compete directly with UPS and FedEx on a massive scale. Today the DSP program counts more than 1,300 delivery firms and 20,000 delivery vans in its ranks worldwide.
One of the benefits for fleets that are Amazon DSPs is having access to sophisticated delivery technology, but the downside is the ease with which the world’s largest online retailer cuts contracts. This has forced many local delivery fleets to search for new opportunities.
Down to the last footWith the amount of investment dollars and capacity flowing into the last mile segment, some technology companies have found opportunities to give fleets a competitive edge by solving complex routing problems.
Generally, fleets have a majority of their deliveries planned in advance for the next day but need to dynamically add stops to these routes for 30% to 40% of orders that come in during the day with same-day delivery expectations.
Solving complex routing problems has positioned some companies to offer fleets an automated dispatch process, which will be even more valuable when autonomous vehicles arrive on the scene.
In 2014, the prospects for using autonomous vehicles for last-mile delivery were bright, and the founders of Wise Systems saw a market opportunity to develop autonomous dispatch, route planning and execution software for last-mile delivery companies.
Wise Systems is not a technology company like Instacart or Uber Eats that is trying to operate in the logistics space. Rather, it offers its technology to fleets. Although the arrival of autonomous delivery vehicles did not happen as originally planned, fleets are using the software to optimize route planning and execution down to the final feet of deliveries, said Ali Kamil, chief technology officer and co-founder of Wise Systems.
The cloud-based software captures time, location and other route data every few seconds from an app that runs on mobile devices. The software knows when drivers arrive, when they get to a customer’s door and when they depart.
With this granular level of data capture — which includes the number and weight of delivery units — the software predicts how long it will take to complete future deliveries at each customer location. It also learns from repeat visits to determine the best way to enter, the best spot to park and the best time to visit to expedite the delivery process.
“Collecting all of this data enables us to learn,” Kamil said, “so we can plan better tomorrow.”
The mobile driver app is easy to use and helps drivers make more money by completing more deliveries each day. “Drivers don’t want to be spending time monkeying around,” he noted. “It needs to be quick and easy.”
Fleets that use the software can dynamically add stops into a route optimization engine and give their customers access to a web portal for tracking the status of deliveries. The end customer can also sign up to receive text or email notifications.
The end customer can get real-time expected time of arrival with accuracy down to five minutes, he said. With this level of visibility, “what we are enabling for customers is a better and faster delivery experience than Amazon,” he said. “We are not just going accept that Amazon is going to dominate.”

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have defined the previous decade. Ever since the massive deployment of concepts like Big Data and cloud architecture occurred, our abilities to generate, store and process data increased by manifold. This resulted in large-scale data analytics implementations across industries and geographies, which further led to the companies incorporating AI strategies. As the companies gradually uncovered the immense potential of AI, IoT and its allied automation processes became integral to businesses as well

To put things into perspective, it’s important to understand that the usage of artificial intelligence technologies in the last four years alone has grown by 270%. Besides this, the AI development sector is also expected to be valued at around 118 billion dollars by 2025. At the other end of the spectrum is IoT. Reports reveal that in 2020 more than 30.73 billion devices were connected to an IoT infrastructure and that by the year 2025, close to 152,200 devices will connect to the internet every minute.
What Is AIoT?
For the uninitiated, AI and IoT are complimentary concepts of technology. Because data is at the fulcrum of everything, AI and IoT become the two sides of the same coin in most use cases. The term that encompasses the integration of both is called AIoT. The two technologies work in tandem to offer optimum experiences and applications to users and businesses. Several IoT mechanisms rely on artificial intelligence and its allied concepts like deep and machine learning from automation and predictive analytics.
AIoT Benefits
Artificial intelligence in IoT product development offers tons of benefits in operations, management, customer behavior analysis, and more. To offer an extensive idea, below are the benefits of AIoT:
Boosting IoT Scalability
Scalability in IoT refers to the addition of more devices in an existing ecosystem. This addition could either optimize existing processes or introduce newer features. With the integration of AI, only the required data for specific components reaches them, making the process super-specific.
For instance, a wearable health device only receives data on heart rate and vitals and not GPS and navigation information. As data crunching happens, it becomes easier to deploy newer devices in an infrastructure.
Propelling Operational Efficiency
Organizations and businesses looking to achieve optimum organizational efficiency can do this with the help of AIoT. AI in IoT can be used to detect patterns from data generated, uncover new insights that are otherwise invisible, implement predictive and preventive analytics, bring in automation, detect and fix operational loopholes, accurately predict attritions, improve employee welfare and morale, and more. With AIoT, even accurate time equipment malfunctions can be predicted for precise corrective measures. These make operations perpetual.
Incorporating New Products or Services
Several existing equipment, products, or services can be incorporated with AI concepts to bring in advanced functionalities or fully develop an AI product. For instance, voice recognition or Natural Language Processing can be implemented for advanced HMI systems, commercial fleets can be integrated with AI and IoT devices for insights generation, and to bring in advanced road and driver safety measures, websites and marketing campaigns can be made more effective and goal-driven through specific parameters and even campaign simulation mechanisms and more.
Optimize Risk Management
As we mentioned before, predictive analytics can be deployed to assess an organization’s probable risks and prevent them with pre-emptive measures. Instances like equipment malfunctioning, cyber-attacks, employee and workplace safety can be predicted, and rapid response protocols can be implemented to better tackle situations. One simple example of risk management with AI is the custom premiums on car insurance policies that completely depend on driver behavior and history.
Real-Time Monitoring and Actions
What becomes crucial with automation and IoT concepts is real-time monitoring. This helps in the consistent supervision of devices, equipment, and modules and allows systems to take decisions and actions when things go wrong autonomously. For instance, when navigation systems in vehicles detect increased traffic in a current route, real-time monitoring allows the vehicle to look for a different route and suggest it to drivers for uninterrupted driving.
Prevent Unintended Downtime
Several industries like oil and natural gas, thermal power plants, automotive factories and more cannot afford downtime, specifically when they are unplanned. They rattle schedules and planning for a specified timeframe, leading to probable losses and delayed deliveries as well.
With AIoT, unplanned downtime can be prevented thanks to predictive maintenance concepts. Based on historic data and current operating trends, machine learning algorithms can accurately predict downtime and schedule advanced servicing or even component replacement to ensure processes are uninterrupted.
Optimized Customer Experience
The volatility associated with consumer behavior has always been a challenge for businesses in delivering good customer service. With AIoT, this can be achieved by introducing new data touchpoints and aspects like heatmaps offer analysts a comprehensive idea of customer behavior.
From understanding market demands to deciphering what sells and what doesn’t, AI can allow businesses to make changes at product and product positioning levels for more revenue and market penetration. AIoT can also make ways for personalized marketing and segmented targeting for more campaign effectiveness.
Industry Influence
AIoT has affected every industry it touched. From manufacturing to healthcare, there is hardly any sector that is yet to experience the awesomeness of AIoT. So, let’s quickly dive into the impact of AIoT across industries to get a better idea.
Manufacturing
In manufacturing, the onset of industrial automation, robotic arms, deep learning algorithms, and more has not only optimized efficiencies but paved the way for reduced operational expenses as well.
Smart Cities and Homes
Smart cities and homes ensure advanced safety for civilians and homeowners with their airtight security systems. Besides, they also help in the responsible consumption of non-renewable resources, curbing pollution, and more.
eCommerce
AIoT in eCommerce helps businesses in advanced product positioning, relationship optimization with vendors, automation of invoicing and billing, generating real-time insights on package deliveries and shipments, and more.
Airlines
With the help of sensors and telematics, airlines are being made safer and trackable with AIoT. The data generated from flight routes are also studied for diverse purposes, including fuel consumption, weather, and more. Besides, AIoT also helps in seamless check-in and airport procedures.
Logistics and Operations
Supply-chains are optimized, and inventory management is simplified with AIoT. Sensors and devices can detect when an item would go out of stock and autonomously replenish the product. AIoT also affects commercial fleets and delivery modules for safety and seamless operations.
Body Sensors
Body sensors can accurately predict when a person is most likely to have a cardiac arrest and notify doctors autonomously. There have been real-world instances of smartwatches saving people as well. In industries, body sensors can be used to prevent calamities and for better tackling of industrial hazards.
Healthcare
Mobile healthcare, electronic health records, remote healthcare consultation, drug research, researches in oncology and genetics are some of the aspects AIoT is working on. From making clinical trials more airtight to helping doctors detect even minute physical changes in skin and organs, AI applications make even the unthinkable possible.
Automobiles
The automotive sector experiences tons of benefits because of AIoT with the implementation of concepts like telematics, human-machine interface systems, in-vehicle infotainment devices, electric vehicles and autonomous vehicle controls, adaptive cruising, and more.
Voice Assistants
Voice assistants detect keywords and help users get advanced or super-precise results for their queries. They also consistently learn about user preferences, tastes, interests, online behavior and recommend personalized content accordingly.
Edge Computing
In edge computing, AIoT offers benefits like reducing latency, increasing network availability, reducing costs involved in storage and data communication, bringing in real-time decision-making systems, and more.
Face Detection
Apart from letting users unlock their phones, IoT applications are helping in finding missing persons and children, preventing retail store crimes, bringing in safety measures in schools, detecting frauds in casinos, finding missing pets and animals and more.
Real-World AIoT Applications
ET City Brain
As we mentioned, AIoT can make cities smarter and roads safer. One such real-world example of this concept in action is ET City Brain. Developed and launched by the Alibaba group, this platform uses artificial intelligence and IoT technology to monitor traffic and road usage, detect accidents, track illegal parking, and pave the way for ambulances by modifying traffic signals and more. The concept also has a proven record of reducing traffic in China by 15%.
Tesla’s Autonomous Cars
What had been a concept only in books and movies has become a reality with the help of AIoT. An autonomous car is a hub of sensors, imaging devices, gadgets, cloud architecture, and data processing modules. All these work together to allow the cars of Tesla to drive autonomously without the need of a driver.
The car collects data from diverse aspects such as road and weather conditions, incoming traffic, pedestrian details, cornering vehicles, speed, fuel consumption, and more and makes accurate driving decisions (every second) for seamless journeys.
Amazon Smart Retail
Amazon Go, a concept store launched by Amazon, is nothing less than revolutionary. It allows users to walk into the store, pick up an item from an aisle and leave. The stores are devoid of cashiers because the IoT devices in action deduct money from users’ virtual wallets. When an item is picked, it’s immediately added to their carts, and when it is kept back, it gets deleted again. When users leave, the system quickly works on the cart orders and processes payment accordingly.
IoT cannot be as effective and powerful as it is now without AI. Together, these two concepts are bringing a new era of experiences and realities to our consciousness. The convergence of AI and IoT only marks the beginning of advanced concepts to come in the near future. What do you think we will get to witness?

IoT technology development gave a start to several interdisciplinary fields that combine IoT with other technologies and studies. One of the most well-known examples of such fields is telematics, a mix of telecommunications, IoT, electrical engineering, and the automotive industry.
While telematics can be applied to education and healthcare, one of its biggest use cases is vehicle telematics. It encompasses vehicle tracking, fleet management, and vehicle maintenance and brings undeniable advantages to the car-sharing industry.
Challenges of Carsharing
To fully comprehend vehicle telematics’ benefits, it is important to understand the actual challenges that the carsharing industry faces.
Carsharing is a car rental model where users rent a car for a short period of time. That means there is always a high user turnover and a very high unpredictability in car maintenance. Since a single car can be used by dozens of people with different driving styles, there is always a chance that some people will be speeding, will be inaccurate while driving, or will leave the engine idling.While telematics allows for easy vehicle monitoring and more accurate routing, it also brings specific benefits to the car-sharing industry by making the driving process safer and allowing better car maintenance.Click To Tweet
If we define the main challenges of the carsharing industry in terms of fleet management, they will be:
Car maintenance: are the drivers managing cars properly?The cost of idling: do cars spend too much time idling?Harsh braking and driving: are drivers speeding or driving inaccurately?Vehicle Location: where are the vehicles at the moment?
All these questions need to be answered to save money for a carsharing company. This is where telematics comes in place and helps resolve these issues.
Telematics: Overview and Benefits
As said above, telematics is a mix of telecommunications and informatics. It can be considered a subset of IoT since it deploys integrated sensors to obtain certain data.
A telematics device for vehicles is called a black box and contains the following components: a GPS receiver, accelerometer, engine interface, a SIM card, a buzzer, and the expander port. This black box captures the data that a vehicle generates (such as car position, speed, fuel consumption, tire pressure, etc.) and sends it to the cloud. In the cloud, the data is processed and analyzed further to the user’s choice application.
Summing up, the black box device provides you with detailed information on the car’s status and its current position–so how can you use this data to your advantage?
Improved Car Maintenance
Battery voltage, tire pressure, brake state – all these and other indicators can be monitored with telematics. Hence, if there is anything wrong with the car or the need for maintenance arises, car owners can react promptly and provide better car maintenance which, in turn, leads to a longer use period of a car.
Improved Operating Cost Management
With carsharing, fuel is usually included in the price, which means a user does not have to pay for it additionally. Hence, the issue of saving costs on fuel is quite acute for the owners of carsharing businesses.
Telematics allows to monitor several factors that affect fuel consumption:
IdlingDriving manner (aggressive driving increases fuel consumption)Weather (low temperatures promote higher fuel consumption)Use of accessories (air conditioning, etc.)
By knowing about such things, car owners can adjust their policy to reduce fuel consumption and cut down fuel costs.
Improved Driver Safety
Telematics offers multiple options for making the driving process safer for drivers. First, you can set up the device to notify the driver if there is a need for maintenance or to slow down (if the driver is speeding). This will naturally lead to a reduced number of dangerous situations.
Second, telematics enables carsharing companies to quickly and easily locate a vehicle. This option can be quite valuable when there is a need to locate a stolen vehicle or a vehicle in an emergency.
Telematics and Fleet Management
Today, there are many providers of telematics-based solutions that fleet owners successfully use. These solutions usually come in the form of a web and/or mobile application and have an admin and a user interface.
Using the data generated by the vehicle black box, the application displays advanced reporting and analytics, allowing easy management of every car in the fleet. Simultaneously, such applications allow users to see a car’s status before booking it and provide easy registration and payment processes. Advanced features may include limited access to vehicles (for authorized drivers only), emergency buttons for dangerous situations, and driver training while being on the road.
Telematics in carsharing provides one significant benefit: it allows the automatic collection of nearly impossible data to be collected manually. This data can further help car-sharing companies make better business decisions by knowing the real-time state of every car in the fleet. As for the drivers, telematics greatly contributes to their safety by monitoring their driving style and providing helpful suggestions during the ride. Hence, it’s safe to assume that telematics is here to stay and expand its presence as the digitization of the automotive industry continues to grow.

 Honolulu can increase the efficiency of its roads in all kinds of ways. 
By Sumner La Croix, Justin Tyndall

The COVID-19 pandemic imposed enormous costs on Honolulu’s population. Many businesses and schools closed their doors, the tourism industry ground to a halt, unemployment rose to record levels and … traffic declined to levels never before seen by even the longest-lived Honolulu resident.
Many marveled at how easy it was to get around the city. Of course, the light traffic was a by-product of lockdowns and mobility restrictions, but it did raise an important question: Was it really necessary to go back to the jam-packed roads of 2019?
Perhaps there were sensible ways to keep traffic at lower levels? If there were, state and city policymakers and bureaucrats seemed too preoccupied to think about them.
And now: The traffic is slowly returning. That’s because people have decided to venture out more to restaurants, gyms, social gatherings and workplaces. The good news is that traffic is still about 20% below 2019 heights.
Traffic returning is generally a good sign, reflecting more people being vaccinated and residents deciding they can engage in more activities in person.
But there is no reason for traffic to return to pre-pandemic levels. Voluntary actions, simple government programs and direct government intervention all have a role to play.

This graph, created from data collected across the entire state of Hawaii, shows the dramatic decrease in traffic brought on by the pandemic — as well as the gradual increase we are all now witnessing. During normal times, residents pay a huge price for congestion. A recent report on traffic in Hawaii estimated the cost of congestion in the state to be $690 million annually. This cost is mainly paid through lost time and productivity from workers sitting in gridlock. Smarter policy could eliminate this cost and direct the savings to local workers.
At low levels of use, most major roads can handle additional cars without traffic slowing appreciably. But at some level of traffic, just a few additional cars can slow traffic dramatically, which imposes costly delays on other drivers. The result in Hawaii is bumper-to-bumper, slow-moving traffic during rush hours on the H-1 and H-2 highways and other major arteries.
Policies that keep those last few cars off the road during rush hour can generate big social benefits. Fortunately, policymakers have an abundance of options to accomplish this, policies that have already been tested and proven in other cities.
Rush Hour Tolls And Other Ideas
The most direct and efficient way to limit traffic would be to levy an electronically monitored toll on congested roads during rush hour. Properly calibrated tolls could make intense rush hour congestion a relic of the past. To allay concerns that tolls would amount to a new tax, revenue could be rebated directly to local residents and even directed preferentially to lower-income households to allay any concerns that tolls would be regressive.
Looking beyond tolls, policymakers face a menu of measures that could improve traffic. Investments in TheBus or cycling infrastructure would help to get some people out of their cars. Rideshare programs are already in place and have potential to be more broadly applied. Giving incentives to local businesses to allow staggered work hours or more remote work would reduce the demand for rush hour commuting.
Despite the large potential gains from these measures, state and local governments across the United States and in Hawaii have struggled to implement effective policies. For example, workers have resisted schemes to stagger office hours and commuting times due to reasonable concerns that staggered and perhaps unpredictable hours will complicate coordination of drop-off and pick-up times for their schoolchildren.
COVID-19 has shaken up this worldview. By forcing so many people to work from home and change their commuting behavior, the pandemic has changed how employers and employees view the costs and benefits of a central workplace and of gathering workers there for fixed hours, Monday to Friday.
Both employers and employees have realized that some (but not all) workers can be as productive at home as in the office, at least some of the time. This has opened the door for employers to offer some employees the option of working from home one or more days per week. Social gains result from these private bargains, as fewer commuters means less traffic.
The same analysis applies to staggered hours. Moving commuting from traditional rush hours to slightly later in the morning has the potential to decrease rush-hour commuting times without adding much additional inconvenience to people commuting mid-morning.
An alternative is to charge a congestion zone fee to drive within the downtown area or perhaps the downtown-to-Waikiki corridor.
Local and state governments could help residents gain the additional social benefits from traffic control by providing incentives to private firms to stagger hours and/or keep more employees working at home. In fact, governments could take the lead on this by providing additional incentives for their own workforces to continue to work some days at home.
Consider that University of Hawaii campuses might accomplish this by not starting most on-campus classes until 10 a.m. and offering more early morning on-line classes.
Today, work from home arrangements have left Honolulu with less traffic congestion. Whether such arrangements will lead to less traffic congestion in the longer term is unclear and there is some reason to be pessimistic.
This is because of what is known as The Fundamental Law of Traffic Congestion: Once traffic lightens, people who found it too congested to drive to downtown Honolulu or Waikiki or Pearlridge Shopping Center will decide to make the trip. As more drivers take more trips, the roads are likely to once again become highly congested.
How To Move Forward
Is there a way out of this cycle, to reduce traffic to manageable levels permanently? Imposing a toll may be problematic due to federal regulations on tolling federally financed highways such as H-1 and H-2. An alternative is to charge a congestion zone fee to drive within the downtown area or perhaps the downtown-to-Waikiki corridor.
Fees to access congested areas have been widely studied and effectively used in other major cities, with London and Stockholm having perhaps the most effective applications. Administration has been smoothed in both cities by technology that monitors license plates entering the congestion zone.
The central Stockholm area is a group of islands, and this geography facilitates the collection of the congestion zone fee: It is charged, via bridges connecting islands, both when a car enters and leaves. The total daily fee varies by the time of entrance/exit and is capped at 135 krona ($16.20). The fee is not charged on public holidays, the day prior to the holiday or during July when most Stockholm residents are on holiday.
Cars driven within the central London congestion zone (an 8.1-square-mile area) pay a daily charge of £15 ($20.85) from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day but Christmas. Billing is based on technology that recognizes license plate numbers and deducts payment from a bank account; or the congestion charge can be pre-paid via an app or website. Residents living in or near the zone receive a 90% discount on the congestion charge. After the charge was implemented, the volume of traffic fell about 9% within the zone and home values within the zone increased.
A congestion zone fee in central Honolulu has been discussed as a complementary policy when the Honolulu rapid transit project reaches downtown, to encourage commuters and day-trippers to use the train. But a well-designed congestion zone fee, set perhaps at $5 to $10 per day, can yield big benefits prior to the train’s arrival in the 2030s.
If the congestion zone fee was in place only during weekday rush hours, workers and firms would have an incentive to allow for more flexible work hours. Workers would also have increased incentives to carpool or take TheBus. And when rush hour traffic improves, the incentives for other drivers to take more trips during rush hour is reduced because they too must also pay the congestion zone fee.
Perhaps the big lesson that we have learned from the pandemic is that we need to rethink the way that we approach certain activities. State and local government leaders have been heavily criticized because they did not take advantage of the downtime to implement better policies to control the costs imposed on the community by tourism.
While the same could be said for traffic, it’s not too late for us to plan for an island with less traffic. There’s no need to wait for the train for that goal to be realized.

 Traffic can be a real pain. Check out this post about IoT and traffic management in smart cities!
By Manohar Parakh
A smart city is classified as a place where citizens live well-organized urban life with the help of information and communication technology (ICT) while maintaining sustainability and causing the least harm to the environment. In greater detail, this means living in a city that plans smart infrastructure and urban services to keep them as efficient as possible. Citizens can easily interact with local bodies, thus, playing a larger role in the city’s management.
A smart city is a place where all the city’s systems like water management, waste management, healthcare, policing and governance, smart buildings, education, energy, etc. are managed in an optimal fashion that benefits citizens, government, and the environment. Reduction in cost and resource consumption is integral to the layout of a smart city. And, all this is impossible without this offshoot of ICT — the IoT technology that can offer governing bodies with real-time solutions for all urban challenges.
What Is IoT?
The Internet of Things or IoT is basically a network of interconnected devices, like sensors and smart devices, that pass on information to each other and a supreme console via the internet. It is that way that we interact with our belongings. All these devices generate data that is so humongous in the amount that it will need hi-tech cloud applications to store, process, and mine. This process is conducted by big data analytics. Any smart city project will use big data to capture, store, process, and analyze large amounts of data generated by several sources and to transform the data into useful knowledge that enables better decision-making processes.
How Big Data and IoT are Being Used in Traffic Management
Traffic management is one of the biggest infrastructure hurdles faced by developing countries today. Developed countries and smart cities are already using IoT and big data to their advantage to minimize issues related to traffic. The culture of the car has been cultivated speedily among people in all types of nations. In most cities, it is common for people to prefer riding their own vehicles no matter how good or bad the public transportation is or considering how much time and money is it going to take for them to reach their destination.
Thus, the increased use of cars has caused an immense amount of traffic congestion. Several countries are overcoming this traffic bottleneck by fetching information from CCTV feeds and transmitting vehicle-related data to city traffic management centers to help create improvements. Better-organized traffic systems mean a better flow of vehicles on the road, and it means no idling cars, buses, and trucks in traffic jams. All this eventually translates to lower run times, proper utilization of natural resources (gas), and less pollution. The emittance of gases is the largest during stop-start driving, and this happens in spots where traffic is regulated by lights. Hence, if you go for smart traffic, this helps in pollution reduction throughout the entire city.
However, smart traffic management also involves other factors, like smart parking sensors, smart streetlights, smart highways, and smart accident assistance amongst other things.
Traffic Lights
Traffic lights that use real-time data feeds are being used to smooth traffic load. Sensors mounted at strategic places can use IoT technology to gather data about high traffic junctions and areas diverting vehicles from these places. Big data can analyze this information further and figure out alternative routes, as well as better traffic signaling to ease congestion. Meanwhile, road-side lights can also work according to weather sensors mounted on them. Dimming of light happens not only as a part of the day-night process but also when weather conditions turn murky. Roadside light sensors can pick up these signals and turn them on and off accordingly.
Smart Parking
Parking has become an Achilles heel in the urban planning scenario. Lack of parking spaces, as well as parallel parking, has heightened traffic snarls at important junctions in cities. IoT-based sensors in parking lots can give out real-time information about empty spots to cars coming from a long distance and looking for a parking space. Such sensors have already been installed in European cities like Paris, France, and Kansas in the US. They have all seen remarkable results with a double-digit percentage reduction in parking issues observed in the span of a year.
Smart Assistance
Road accidents have been one of the top causes of deaths across the world. However, what adds to this gloomy number is the untimely help and assistance to victims in these accidents. CCTVs and sensors on roads can help in locating accident spots and communicating these to the nearest emergency rooms. Once this communication is established in time, all else can be better handled. 
Challenges
All pros become more quantifiable with cons. While IoT and big data present a path-breaking opportunity in smart traffic management and solutions, they also have some limitations. Firstly, current cities already suffer from infrastructure issues like road planning, zoning, and other construction-related issues that could potentially pose problems when implementing IoT technology.
Secondly, all these fancy, hi-tech solutions need high-speed data transfer techniques and, thus, can work only in cities with great internet connectivity. If for any reason, this connectivity is hampered, the entire smart city could fall apart.
Thirdly, the number of devices accessing the central network means more opportunities for hackers to conduct their malicious attacks. An added layer of security, apart from the usual one and another on top of that, will be needed to make an impenetrable hack-proof smart traffic solution. Data privacy will also have to be maintained, looping in lawmakers and engineers.
Conclusion
Traffic is a crucial aspect that determines a city’s livability factor and efficiency status. Population surge will stop mattering if data and sensors are used capably to manage traffic. As smart cities evolve and increase in number in the coming years, IoT and big data will play a key role in the development and integration of services and infrastructure. With passing time, other issues besides traffic, like waste management, energy conservation, etc., will greatly benefit from the growth of IoT and big data.

Emphasis on emissions reduction is even more important today, especially as the demand for manufacturing and the movement of goods has exploded. Find out how hundreds of companies are working towards ‘net zero’ carbon strategies. 
By John Flynn
A renewed movement and focus on emissions reduction is gaining significant traction throughout corporate America. Hundreds of companies today have plans to significantly cut back on their greenhouse-gas emissions to “net-zero” through several carbon-reduction technologies.
Nearly 1,400 companies have promised to cut their net carbon dioxide emissions to zero over the coming decades. So-called carbon offsets, where the gas is removed from the atmosphere, are central to many of these plans.
This emphasis on emissions reduction is even more important today, especially as the demand for manufacturing and the movement of goods has exploded because of online shopping. Parcel carriers around the world continue to report record profits with expectations this trend will last into 2021.
The promise of sustainable transportation
Reinforcing this, 2021 has started out with different priorities from President Biden, who has made clean and sustainable infrastructure one of his primary agenda items for his new administration in the White House.
During his presidential campaign, President-elect Biden discussed a $2 trillion plan to build a “modern, sustainable infrastructure and an equitable clean energy future.” These remarks were echoed in a recent article in Logistics Management.
“Americans deserve infrastructure they can trust: Infrastructure that is resilient to floods, fires, and other climate threats, not fragile in the face of these increasing risks,” the plan says.
Sustainable infrastructure that thrives through carbon reduction today is taking place in all forms. For private and for-hire transportation fleets this includes new Class 8 trucks equipped with clean diesel technology that help move retail goods, food and medicine across the country.
Clean transportation initiatives
Organizations continue to put clean, sustainable, and carbon-friendly transportation equipment at the forefront of their operation strategies. In fact, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently highlighted 75 companies that received the agency’s SmartWay Excellence Awards, where companies lead their industries by improving freight efficiency and contributing to cleaner air throughout their supply chains.
“The EPA is recognizing leaders in sustainable freight and transportation, an industry that has proven — particularly in this last year — to be absolutely vital to our economy and our way of life,” said Karl Moor, deputy assistant administrator for EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation, in a FleetOwner article. “There is not a family business anywhere in America, a Fortune 500 company, or farm that doesn’t rely on the freight system in some way.”
On average, the transportation system moves about 49 tons of freight valued at more than $53 billion per day, Moor said. More than 72% of this freight — 80% by ton and more than 70% by revenue — moves by truck. Nearly 8 million people are employed by trucking-related jobs, of which 3.6 million are truck drivers, Moor added.
According to Karl Simon, director of EPA’s Transportation and Climate Division, transportation is also the largest contributor to the nation’s climate emissions. Freight currently accounts for about a third of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions. Globally, freight activity is expected to quadruple by 2050 with associated emissions increases, he said.
Acquiring newer, more efficient heavy-duty trucks through innovative programs
To combat this, fleets are now leveraging critical data, analytics and innovative programs through procurement strategies and life cycle cost management (LCCM) for their Class 8 truck fleets. Implementing an asset management strategy based on shorter vehicle life cycles conserves fuel, reduces emissions, lowers maintenance costs, provides a cleaner environment, and is more economically sustainable.
These programs promote sustainability through optimizing vehicle specification to be more fuel efficient, and to align with the duty cycle as well as geographical locale. Newer specifications include lighter components that allow for longer maintenance intervals, which reduces environmental hazmat waste disposal.
Today’s advanced truck life cycle analytics allow fleets to leverage business intelligence to lower fuel costs by monitoring various metrics of fuel economy, ultimately contributing to a greener environment.
The key in accessing this insight is leveraging data to identify a truck’s tipping point – the point in which it costs more to operate an older truck model than it costs to exchange for a newer more fuel-efficient model. As an example, a recent analysisfrom Fleet Advantage shows that upgrading to 2021 model year truck from a 2016 model would reduce CO2 by 21 metric tons and NOx by 15%. Additionally, this would result in a $16,856 per truck savings. In a fleet of 100 vehicles, that would equate to $1,685,600.
Over time, the true value add is to downstream older truck models into the secondary market, creating an ongoing effect of reduced emissions.
The use of data analytics in truck replacement has been proven to be highly effective. This approach was utilized by a Global-2000 and Top 100 Private Fleet health-conscious wholesale grocer that carries and distributes products to customer locations throughout the U.S. and Canada. The company has over 1,500 Class 8 truck vehicles and runs about 100,000 miles per year. Under the program, the company saved more than 8,500 metrics tons of CO2 as well as helped conserve 848,575 gallons of fuel. Additionally, the company cut costs in their fleet, saving millions of dollars in operating expenses.
America depends on transportation as the backbone of the economy, ensuring that critical goods are moved from one point to another. As we begin a new year and a new presidential administration, a renewed focus on sustainable infrastructure with clean transportation systems will be a key priority. Companies that realize shorter life cycles on trucks, with a strong emphasis in replacing with cleaner equipment will be the true leaders in the economic recovery.

Decarbonizing the last mile using electric motors and muscles
By Alyssa Sporrer
A day in the office — or biking the streets of sunny Miami — begins at the DHL Service Center for e-cargo bike couriers.
From there, Orlando Rosal makes his way to the REEF Technology garage, where an e-Cargo Cycle is waiting for him. Once he transfers a 60-cubic-foot container onto his bike, he takes off for Brickell Bay and various Miami neighborhoods, delivering packages along the way.
Electric-assisted cargo bikes (e-cargo bikes) have an electric motor, which means that couriers such as Rosal don’t need to be in shape for the next Tour de France or RAGBRAI in order to haul more freight or travel challenging distances. That’s one reason why, according to a study, drivers initially hesitant to try e-cargo bikes often “get a silly grin on their face” after climbing on board the first time.
Even so, couriers can adjust how much physical effort they put forth and how much of the work they want to put on the electric motor as they navigate different landscapes. They could get a full-on workout every day they’re out making deliveries — and many couriers like the option to use the electric assist or be more physically active while working.
“Unlike previous jobs when I might not have had time to go to the gym,” Rosal told FreightWaves, “operating an e-Cargo Cycle for DHL Express keeps me in great shape.”
Riding an e-cargo bike also prompts curiosity among those who see Rosal on the streets, as e-cargo bike couriers are not a common sight in Miami. Rosal said people often ask to take their picture with him, and he is becoming somewhat of a celebrity for his hard work. 
“People on the street are overwhelmingly positive,” he said. 
It’s an acknowledgement that e-cargo bikes have the potential to meaningfully reduce air pollution in cities. In essence, Rosal and others cyclists who perform delivery jobs without need of an internal combustion engine are seen as do-gooders.
Rosal’s bike courier position became available when DHL Express and REEF partnered with the city of Miami to implement a pilot project featuring three-wheeled e-Cargo Cycles in 2020. According to DHL Express, e-Cargo Cycles have the capacity to carry 400 pounds of cargo, and each one saves an estimated 101,000 kilograms of CO2 emissions annually. 
That’s the greenhouse gas (GHG) equivalent that about 22 passenger cars emit in a year, according to the EPA.
E-commerce and food delivery business then skyrocketed in the last year during the pandemic, expanding the demand for home deliveries. Parcel delivery companies such as UPS, DHL and Amazon, along with restaurants and food delivery companies, are deploying an increasing number of e-cargo bikes in major urban areas. 
“Alleviating the stresses on freight flows in these areas can have a positive impact on productivity, congestion, health and well-being, as well as carbon reduction,” noted a 2020 study titled, “Delivering the last mile: Scoping the potential for e-cargo bikes,” which was conducted by the University of Salford in Manchester, U.K., and funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council’s DecarboN8 project.
E-cargo bike fleets require a lot of work to implement
Government regulations, population density and courier safety are just a few things to analyze when trying to get a fleet of e-cargo bikes operational in a city.
Obtaining approval of e-cargo bikes through state and city councils can be one of the most difficult parts of implementing an e-cargo bike fleet, Greg Hewitt, CEO at DHL Express, said in an interview with FreightWaves. That’s why, in addition to doing in-depth research related to demographics, population density and traffic, companies like DHL and REEF work closely with cities before rolling out e-cargo bikes. 
It’s all about the motivation, Hewitt added. Cities with greater noise pollution, air pollution, parking and traffic issues are more likely to be in favor of e-cargo bikes, especially if they have environmental goals to reduce GHG emissions.
Along with government approval, perhaps even before venturing down that path, a high population density within close proximity to charging hubs needs to be confirmed. 
Claudio Innocente, senior vice president of operations and last-block deliveries at REEF Technology, said that a 2- to 3-mile delivery radius is ideal for e-cargo bike efficiency.
“High-density urban areas are where we’ve seen success” deploying e-cargo bikes to replace van routes, 1-for-1, Hewitt said. 
Vertical delivery markets where a courier can pull up to an apartment building, park and deliver several packages on different levels of the same building are very efficient, he added.
Not all buildings have the infrastructure to install several e-cargo bike charging stations, so DHL partnered with REEF to use its charging infrastructure. Hewitt said the company otherwise would have had to retrofit older buildings. DHL is considering things like charging infrastructure and hub location when designing new urban logistics hubs to work well with e-cargo bikes and electric delivery vans, he added. 
REEF Technology has about 4,800 locations in 50 cities that touch 70% of North America’s “densely populated urban areas,” according to company information. It often sets up logistics hubs in underutilized parking garages.
High-density urban areas are where we’ve seen success.GREG HEWITT, CEO, DHL EXPRESS
Assuming the infrastructure is there, and governments are on board, costs and courier safety are still major concerns for companies. 
E-cargo bikes can be almost the same price as a secondhand van, ranging in price from $2,000 to $7,000, according to the Salford study. While electric cargo bikes are significantly more expensive than regular bikes, they are still cheaper than electric and diesel delivery vans or trucks. The maintenance and operating costs for e-cargo bikes are also much lower than those for delivery vehicles, the study said.
Since the REEF-DHL partnership is in Miami, they have not had to deal with many weather-related issues there. Hewitt said that couriers are protected from the elements. Innocente said that REEF Technology targets cities where e-cargo bikes can be used year-round, but it still has hubs in locations like Seattle and New York City. 
Along with protection from the weather, these e-cargo bikes are designed with safety in mind. Though couriers do not need a special license, they have to complete training for operating e-cargo bikes.
“The bike courier is seen as a bit of a dangerous job,” Hewitt said. 
In movies and on TV, there is a stigma to overcome that bike couriers are not overly safe. Hewitt said that DHL Express has only had positive feedback in Miami, boasting that there have been no injuries, accidents or complaints from the city thus far.
The Salford study said that GPS systems and the size of e-cargo bikes improve courier safety. Though they are large compared to traditional bicycles, e-cargo bikes have limited space for packages compared to delivery vehicles.
On especially busy days, Rosal said that he has to return to the REEF garage to pick up more freight in order to finish his route. This sometimes frustrates him because he likes to complete his work as efficiently as possible.
Lot of hoops to jump through just for some bikes. Why bother?
Many companies are setting ambitious GHG emission-reduction targets, but reducing emissions that contribute to climate change is just one of the many benefits of using e-cargo bikes.
E-cargo bikes can help reduce noise and air pollution in cities. They have zero tailpipe emissions and very few overall emissions when compared to diesel or electric delivery vans. Because of this, their contribution to air pollution in population-dense cities is virtually nonexistent.
Innocente believes that e-cargo bikes have “more than a lot” of potential to help decarbonize the last mile.
The Salford study said that one business could reduce CO2 emissions 75% by switching deliveries from vans to e-cargo bikes whenever possible. 
Air-quality concerns and limits on particulate matter and NOx emissions have led cities to implement low-emissions zones or ban diesel vehicles altogether, a 2020 study called “Vehicle requirements for electric cargo bikes in commercial transport” and conducted by the Ministry of Economics Baden-Württemberg noted.
These regulations force companies that rely on deliveries for food or other packaged goods to rethink their delivery fleet. 
Along with environmental and health concerns, e-cargo bikes alleviate parking, traffic and congestion issues in cities. Some cities such as New York have started to put congestion pricing in places where traffic is especially heavy. 
Depending on regulations and city setups, e-cargo bikes can drive on the road or use bike lanes and bike-friendly zones such as parks to bypass and maneuver through busy, bumper-to-bumper traffic. 
Larger e-cargo bikes can be more difficult to maneuver through traffic since they generally weigh more and have a wider turn radius, the Salford study said. Cities with a more robust bike lane network and bike parking privileges make e-cargo bikes seem like a more attractive option. 
Some cIties are giving e-cargo bikes privileges to park in commercial parking zones previously set aside for delivery trucks and some are even waiving meter fees, the Ministry of Economics study said. This means couriers can pull up to their delivery location, park right in front of a building, drop off their parcels and be on their way. 
Meanwhile, delivery trucks and vans waste time driving back and forth or around to block to find a spot. They often end up double parking illegally and blocking bus and vehicle traffic, congesting streets even more. 
At the same time as demand for home deliveries is rising, the Ministry of Economics study said, heavy traffic makes it harder and harder to deliver packages on time.
Perceptions that e-cargo bikes are slower than vans are inaccurate because the speed limits are typically 12-15 miles per hour in the busy urban zones where they travel anyway, Innocente said. There is an argument that e-cargo bikes are faster overall because of traffic and parking issues that vehicle drivers have to deal with. 
Rosal said that he is able to complete his route more quickly and provide better service for DHL customers because he can temporarily leave an e-Cargo Cycle in bicycle parking areas on sidewalks and streets long enough to make deliveries and pickups.
All of these benefits make bike couriers’ jobs easier, which is important because companies implementing e-cargo bikes need courier buy-in.
“I think our couriers are overall very supportive of sustainability efforts and like the idea,” Hewitt said.
Rosal added that he is proud to be able to deliver packages without contributing to GHG emissions and air pollution. 
Choosing your wheels
Choosing the right kind of e-cargo bike depends on the application. Hot food deliveries and parcel deliveries have completely different requirements. 
Hot food needs to be kept in a container or bag warmer. E-cargo bikes for this purpose are often two-wheeled with smaller containers because couriers need to make more trips back to the restaurant in between food deliveries. The two wheels allow couriers to navigate through traffic more nimbly and squeeze into even tighter parking spaces.
Using e-cargo bikes for parcel deliveries requires a higher capacity for space and weight. These e-cargo bikes sometimes have cargo on a trailer in the back, have a cargo container in front of the handlebars or have a cargo container right behind the courier.
DHL has deployed many four-wheeled Cubicycles in Europe, which reduce energy use by up to 90% when compared to electric vans. Apart from a 2019 pilot project in New York City, only two- and three-wheeled e-cargo bikes have been approved in the U.S., Hewitt said. 

“One of the challenges with the European version we have is the minute they have four wheels, it’s almost like they’re looked at differently. They get classified as a proper van or vehicle, and they’re subject to a lot more restrictions and limitations,” Hewitt said. 
Europe has a more developed infrastructure for biking and walking, and it is more progressive, so it has been easier for DHL Express to implement e-cargo bikes there, Hewitt added. “The Netherlands loves bikes, so they were able to get past the four wheels.”
Cubicycles often get stuck in city council, while the three-wheeled e-Cargo Cycles move through much faster, he said. 
Though four-wheeled e-cargo bikes like the Cubicycle can haul more freight, Innocente said that REEF Technology has only attempted to deploy two- and three-wheeled e-cargo bikes. 
“The three wheels is the best compromise between activity, size and stability,” Innocente said. 
DHL Express is hoping to deploy e-cargo bike fleets in additional cities such as Los Angeles, Washington and Chicago by the end of 2021, Hewitt said.
Despite challenges with regulations, population density, costs and courier safety, e-cargo bikes have the potential to reduce GHG emissions in urban environments. While their efficiency is only meaningful in densely populated cities, e-cargo bikes could play an important role in decarbonizing the last mile.
And if you happen to see Rosal atop his e-Cargo Cycle on the streets of Miami, feel free to ask for a photo. He won’t mind.

We have advanced systems in place for most chores and daily tasks. However, parking still remains a hassle and time-consuming activity that most people hate. Isn’t it time we move on to a much more convenient parking method that could save time and effort? Data-driven parking is the answer to the parking predicament for the urban areas of the world. A market report by Allied Market Research predicts that the smart parking market will have a valuation of $11.13 billion by 2027. This is why data is the future of parking.
What is Data-Driven Parking?
Imagine having a parking spot ready even before you leave your house. And the cherry on top is you get to pay for it digitally. Well, that is certainly possible with the power of data intelligence.
Data-driven parking makes it possible for you to book a parking spot before you actually reach your destination. This is made possible by real-time data. It tells you where a vacant parking spot is available near your workplace or the shopping mall. How? The data-driven parking technology uses data to keep track of vehicles and different parking spots.
These may include the analysis of vehicles’ movement on the road, connected parking meters, sensors, cameras, and boom-barriers. Hence, it is also known as a smart parking solution. All you have to do is open the application and look for a parking space on your phone and reserve it!
Benefits of Data-driven Parking Facility
Saving 20 minutes every day by pre-booking a parking spot via a smartphone app can save a lot of your time in the longer run. However, there are some other benefits of smart parking as well.
Real-time monitoring: As the name suggests, the Data-driven parking system analyses data to find the vacant parking spots in real-time. It combines the power of cell phones and advanced technologies such as IoT, AI, Machine Learning, and Big Data Analytics to help you find the right spot. Also, it uses a real-time data management system to track and keep a record of vehicles.Digital payment: With data-driven parking, you don’t have to look for cash every time you park your car. Smart parking apps allow you to pay for the parking space digitally through various payment modes.Space optimization: We’ve all seen vacant spots in parking lots. Through a data-driven system, parking facility managers can optimize the use of their space and thus increase revenue.No stress: Looking for a parking spot can become frustrating and stressful. Thus, Data-driven parking is an ideal option, as it removes the stress and uncertainty of finding a parking spot. Knowing that you have a parking spot awaiting you can help you enjoy the drive more.
Bottom Line
Data-driven parking can help you save time, as it eliminates the long process of searching for a parking spot. Hence, no more circling the parking lot looking for an empty space every day.
By using the latest technology and data science, tasks such as car parking can be made simpler. In most urban cities, road traffic is a pressing issue, and the only way to tackle it is to take the smart and data-driven route. Most global cities plan to become smart cities within the next few years. And, Smart parking initiatives will bring the Citizens of such cities closer to Smart living.d

The rise of autonomous vehicles will redefine how our cities are built and how we perceive transportation in urban environments. 
By Sophie Zoria 
Automation of routine tasks is currently a concept that interests many industries. Among the most revolutionary parts of it are autonomous vehicles. There are visions of the future of city infrastructure. The main ideas they all share are self-driving cars and shared mobility. Those are set to revolutionize the ways we navigate through cities. 
Such concepts will make our whole cities smart, by fundamentally changing their infrastructure so that it’s adapted to autonomous vehicles. This will provide us with much safer roads. According to the USA National Highway Traffic Administration, 94 percent of serious car crashes are due to human error.
Autonomous driving wouldn’t need people’s decisions, which could often be dangerous and irrational to take you from point A to point B. This means a significant decrease in accidents and thousands of saved lives. 
The tremendous technological progress now gives us the possibility to have a closer look at all the advantages we could have in our cities of the future, together with autonomous driving and the new smart infrastructure. 
It’s expected that thanks to the advanced 5G network, combined with the Internet of Things, the global market revenue of autonomous vehicles will hit $556.67 billion by 2026. All those emerging technologies working together will change the traditional look of our cities, and they’ll become smart as well. 
However, we’re still years away from fully autonomous cars hitting the mass market. So what’s the key to adopting this revolutionary technology, and how do we need to change our cities to make that possible?
The Autonomous Vehicle Infrastructure
We wouldn’t be able to go fully autonomous without the right infrastructure. We can’t just switch to self-driving cars. The shift will also require enhanced manufacturing processes and new kinds of supply chains. Most importantly, the infrastructure must be prepared for it. Once all that’s ready, we’ll start seeing autonomous cars on urban streets.
We’re getting closer to the time when mobility freedom will finally be available to everyone. To measure that, KPMG has made an Automotive Vehicle Readiness Index, which shows how prepared different countries are for autonomous driving. According to their research, the country that’s most prepared for the new infrastructure is the Netherlands. It could serve as a model for other countries to follow to accelerate the global adoption of the technology. 
Right behind, in 2nd and 3rd places, are Singapore and the United States. However, none of those countries has a total score of over 30, which means that even the most prepared countries at the moment still have a long way to go.
A Challenging Project
The automotive industry is rapidly evolving, which makes the need for the new smart autonomous vehicle infrastructure more necessary than ever. Authorities have to consider updates to it and work with developers to make the new wave of urban transformation successful. 
What the Netherlands has, more than the others, are harmonized regulations, standards and excellent roads that will easily undergo renovation. To be ready for self-driving cars, this country would still need some improvements, such as advanced on-road telematics, smart curbs, and lanes. 
Here are changes to be made so that the new smart city infrastructure will be suitable for autonomous vehicles:
Lane Marking
Poor road markings are challenging even for the already existing connected vehicles. It’s something that has to be worked on for the effective adoption of AVs. The road markings should not only be reflective but machine-readable. 
Roadside Sensors
To be prepared for the driverless future, roadside sensors should be included on sidewalks, curbs and lanes. They will allow vehicles to keep track of their surroundings and foresee potentially dangerous situations.
Smart Signage
Current autonomous vehicles use image recognition for reading road signs. However, a much more reliable approach would be machine-readable signs. They will include an embedded code that could be transmitted. They’ll send messages detectable by computers. 
Changing the Way Cities Look
Cities of the future will be transformed into actual digital hubs. We know technology today is mostly human-centered, which means that cities will become better places to live. The adoption of connected autonomous vehicles will increase road capacity and reduce congestion, even in the most densely populated areas. 
It’s expected that the driverless future will fundamentally change the look of cities’ infrastructure. For instance, traffic lights might no longer be needed, as they were originally designed for humans. Instead, machines could determine driving priority themselves and actually be more efficient. Autonomous cars are also connected and they could form fleets that travel in the same direction and share all the information on their surroundings.
Smart roads that include the right signage, sensors and lining will be extremely useful for vehicles, making passengers experience safer than ever. 
Following our previous example of the Netherlands as the most AV-ready country in the world, we can see that the changes that they’ve made to their infrastructure already result in safety, as the number of road deaths decreases every year. 
No More Parking Facilities
Looking for a parking spot can be quite stressful. Fortunately, with the revolution of autonomous vehicles, cities won’t need any type of parking anymore. Garages will move outside of downtown areas, thanks to the predicted trend of shared mobility. 
Furthermore, self-driving cars are able to use narrower driving lanes and maneuver better than existing cars, so parking spaces will be optimized to accommodate more cars. All the space that is currently used for parking could find new uses in smart cities. 
Connectivity Is Key
From a single traffic cone to the overall autonomous driving infrastructure – it’s all about connectivity. Have you noticed that no one mentions fuel when talking about autonomous vehicles? Well, that’s because gasoline wouldn’t matter as much as connectivity would.
Autonomous vehicles will bring tons of sensors and IoT devices to modern cities. The advanced 5G network will allow them to constantly receive and transmit huge amounts of data. Moreover, the steering wheel will be replaced by whatever the driver desires, which will produce more load on the network.
The Impact of 5G
5G might be the missing piece of the puzzle to make efficient autonomous vehicles. The network claims to be a hundred times faster than the current 4G. It’s expected that it would serve 40 percent of the world by 2024.
5G wireless technology would require extensive infrastructure. New fiber-optic cables will have to be placed throughout this new autonomous vehicle infrastructure. This will be helpful for future infrastructure changes for self-driving cars. The promise of this next-generation network to bring safer driverless cars could lead to a revolutionary development of smart cities. 
A New Life for Cities
Automotive vehicles won’t just change the way we travel, they will generally change the look of current infrastructure, not only in cities but on highways as well. The AV revolution might bring us to a future of smooth and predictable traffic and more efficient public transportation. 
City residents will have more free space to make use of. Moreover, there will be fewer risks for pedestrians and bicyclists as they have many concerns about urban areas. All of the benefits that autonomous vehicles together with smart cities could bring will improve millions of people’s quality of life while taking next-level care for the environment.

 Jason Morgan is the editor of Fleet Equipment. He has more than 15 years of B2B journalism experience covering the likes of trucking and construction equipment, real estate, movies and craft beer industries 
ByJason Morgan

It’s fun to talk about the buzz of the last mile delivery segment, but you get to a point where you think: What is the actual growth and makeup of the segment, and what does that mean for fleets?
For answers to those questions and a closer look at the booming trucking segment, I connected with Chad Heminover, president of The Shyft Group’s Fleet Vehicles and Services business unit. You may recognize The Shyft Group’s brands, including Utilimaster, Royal Truck Body, DuraMag, and Strobes-R-Us, to name a couple. With the Utilimaster brand, Heminover is on the front lines with last mile delivery operations, helping them make equipment decisions and navigate the increasingly complicated equipment technology evolution as electric vehicles enter the market and last mile demand grows.
Here’s what Heminover had to say.
Fleet Equipment (FE): What growth have you seen in the last mile segment in the past year and half, and how much do you see it growing going forward in the short term?
Heminover: What we’re seeing is that e-commerce is expected to grow 22% through 2022. Then you start looking at: What does that mean in regards to the parcel market and what these last mile delivery companies are going to need from a vehicle perspective?
If you take UPS, FedEx, Amazon, DHL and the likes, we’ve done some market research that tells us that the compound average growth rate from 2021 through 2025 is going to be about 13%. That’s going to give us an opportunity to continue to build more vehicles for that space.
FE: What’s the Shyft Group’s position in the last mile space? What applications do you serve?
Heminover: We have an offering that covers Class 1 through 7 vehicles, and it supports the last mile delivery space. We have three products that we service or rebuild for large parcel delivery customers. We have our step van business, which is the traditional walk-in van that we sell to the country’s largest parcel delivery fleets. Those are the bigger vehicles. We also have a truck body segment within, within the Utilimaster brand that we build truck bodies that also service that last mile delivery segment. Lastly, we have an upfit side of the business where we are upfitting cargo vans that are used in last mile applications as well, for those parcel delivery companies.
FE: What’s the makeup of last mile delivery companies you’ve worked with?
Heminover: There’s a good mix. If you look at this segment, you have companies like UPS that employ professional drivers and own their vehicles; you have FedEx Express that has a fleet of vehicles that are corporate owned. Then you have the other side that’s a delivery service provider model—these are contractors that buy a variety of different types of vehicles that Amazon has spec’d. Finally, you have the FedEx ground contractor segment; they’re not employees of FedEx, they’re contractors.
There are also a lot of new companies entering this space. On the FedEx Ground side, for example, there are a lot of new entrants into the contractor space, and their current contractors need more vehicles as a result of the growth that the market is experiencing.
FE: With such a diverse field of companies and contractors, are there any pieces of standout equipment spec’ing advice?
Heminover: Yeah, we try to spec the truck to the routes. For example, if you’re a FedEx ground contractor, and you’re trying to figure out what vehicle you need, it all depends on your route size. If you have a high frequency of stops in your delivery schedule, the truck body that we would put you in is a cutaway. If your application has less frequent stops or you need a bigger payload, and you need durability, we’d put you in a dry freight truck body.
If you have an urban and rural route, and you want to be able to get in and out of the vehicle efficiently, we would put you into a walk-in van. We have a new product that we just launched in October that’s getting some great market feedback—our Velocity F2 product line, which complements our Velocity M3. The F2 is built on a Ford Transit chassis. The Velocity M3 is built on a Mercedes chassis. These are Class 2 or 3 vehicles that are ideal for urban delivery and serving multiple drivers and different routes.
FE: How do you help customers calculate cost of ownership?
Heminover: That’s what they’re still all trying to learn. Each of these customers has different expectations of the vehicle life cycle, especially in the contractors segment. Larger companies that have been in the market for a long time have their ROI models figured out, but smaller contractors that are mom-and-pop operations are learning the hard way in a lot of cases where the vehicles break down, and they’re putting a lot of money back into them when they should, in some cases, be replacing them.
What we do is help them understand that we provide aftermarket support. We have a field services team that educates them on the pros and cons of each vehicle. We have that close relationship with the customer because what we do very well is, we are the ones that are designing the package that goes into the back of any of the vehicles that we do. All of these customers are looking to the upfitter to come up with packages that meet the needs of their drivers.
FE: There’s a lot of buzz in this segment about electric vehicles. What are you hearing from your customer base in terms of adoption of EVs?
Heminover: My view on the EV space is: EV is coming. There are a lot of companies and organizations that are throwing a lot of money at the electric vehicle space. The economics currently doesn’t make sense if you’re in the buyer’s position, but somebody is going to figure it out. All the big fleet customers are having some type of initiative around electric vehicles and [going] green. But I think they’re probably a couple of years out before smaller fleets actually make a significant investment in electric vehicles, just because of the fact that there’s a significant investment that has to go on the infrastructure to be able to support these vehicles.

 By investing in solutions that improve communication and collaboration and provide end-to-end visibility across the supply chain, CPGs and suppliers will have the insight necessary to make informed decisions that will push their businesses forward. 
By Jason Tham
kamonrat- Global Network
For years, supply chain planners have relied on forecasting to ensure the supply chain is able to react to market and industry fluctuations, and in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry especially, shifting consumer demands. As 2020 showed us, however, there are certain things that even the most comprehensive forecast cannot account for. Without the ability to accurately forecast, how can supply chain leaders ensure their supply chain is able to respond to changes in real time?
By investing in operational agility, which prioritizes communication, collaboration and visibility over demand sensing and scenario planning, supply chain planners have the capabilities to respond quickly to demand and supply variability, maximizing their ability to deliver on-time and in-full despite marketplace volatility.
So, how can supply chain planners put this into practice? 
Digitize the extended network
CPG supply chains are complex, largely due to the broad network of external supply chain partners they rely upon to fulfill orders. While CPGs can adopt new solutions to digitize their internal supply chains, the benefits of these solutions will be limited if there is no visibility into external partners’ activity. For years, these relationships have been managed via phone calls, Excel spreadsheets and emails. Not only does this leave the door open for miscommunications and mistakes, but it also makes it impossible for those in the supply chain to react quickly when speed matters most. 
To overcome these challenges, CPGs must digitally transform their end-to-end supply chain, including their external partner network. Not only do CPGs need to be digitally connected to their external partners, but they also need to ensure that those partners have the digital capabilities themselves to capture and share real-time information from the shop floor.
 By digitizing, CPGs and their partners unlock real-time data in the late-stage supply chain, which allows them to make smart and quick decisions to ensure products arrive at their final destination on-time and in-full. Most importantly though is improved collaboration. With a cloud-based solution that can digitally track all aspects of the shop floor – from production to inventory levels – CPGs and suppliers see every detail of the supply chain in real time via a centralized platform, improving efficiency for all. 
Streamline collaboration with visibility 
One of the most important benefits of a digitized supply chain is the improved relationship between suppliers and CPGs. While many of these organizations have done business together for years, much of the relationship has been transactional or sometimes even adversarial. However, by digitizing operations, both parties can provide the other with unprecedented visibility into each other’s operations and pave the path towards more streamlined collaboration. 
Not only does this deepen trust and mutuality between the two partners, it also allows for the relationship to become more strategic, as those involved have more time to focus on big picture initiatives to improve performance or grow the business vs. spending countless hours manually gathering, tracking, analyzing and sharing data. 
For consumer brands, having visibility into the performance and capacity of their entire network helps them quickly and easily assess attainment against commitments made and available capacity to make future commitments. This ultimately leads to CPGs more consistently meeting or exceeding customer demands, a win/win for all. 
Improve communication with access to network capacity
Disruption is a constant in today’s connected world. While 2020 has caused most to consider “disruption” as something significant – like a global pandemic – in the CPG space it can be something as routine as a rush order being placed. With today’s manual processes, any unexpected change causes stress and cascading downstream impacts on the CPG and the supplier. Oftentimes, CPGs have no way to understand if their network is able to absorb the changes, and suppliers must scramble to determine if they have the capacity to make the change on their production floor. 
With a digitized supply chain that extends throughout the entire partner network, CPGs and suppliers alike have access to data that allows them to make smarter business decisions. By leveraging data gathered by these solutions, decision makers can be sure they are making an informed choice by reviewing things like the availability of raw material, labor and manufacturing capacity. 
They also have access to a dedicated communication channel, helping to reduce the amount of back-and-forth between the CPG and supplier when making these decisions and ensuring all parties are working off the most up-to-date information. With access to real-time information and a centralized communication platform, agility becomes easy, even in the face of disruption. 
While the world works toward “normal” following the upheaval of 2020, the ability to streamline and optimize processes is critical. By investing in solutions that improve communication and collaboration and provide end-to-end visibility across the supply chain, CPGs and suppliers will have the insight necessary to make informed decisions that will push their businesses forward.

Long range drone delivery – greater than 20 kilometers or about 12 miles – is emerging as a fast growing in the autonomous delivery market, according to a new research report.
Short range autonomous delivery has gotten a lot of press recently as companies like Walmart, Amazon, Wing, and UPS engage in high profile drone delivery trials. 
 During the current COVID crisis, contactless delivery has delivered significant benefits to vulnerable communities.  Trials delivering consumer medical supplies from local retail outlets to retirement communities, or library books to local middle school students, demonstrate the benefits of short-range drone delivery.
A new research report from Markets and Markets, however, shows that autonomous delivery of longer distances may be an even more important sector.  
Chinese retail giant JD.com introduced contactless drone delivery in rural areas of China earlier this year: other vendors are exploring medium- to long-range drone delivery for applications such as delivery of parts and supplies along pipeline or transportation infrastructure routes.  
Walmart is testing several short range delivery projects along with one with drone delivery company Zipline to explore longer range routes.
This is a trend that the research report sees continuing.. “Based on range, the long range (>20 kilometers) segment of the aerial delivery drones market and the ground delivery vehicles market is projected to grow at a higher CAGR than the small range (<20 kilometers) segment from 2019 to 2030. 
Increasing demand for the autonomous last mile delivery of packages to long-distance destinations is fueling the growth of this segment of the market,” says a report summary.
While BVLOS flight is still generally not allowed without a waiver in the U.S., the FAA is working to create a framework that supports mid- to long-range drone delivery.  Their efforts are reflected in another conclusion in the report: that North America led the market in 2019 and will continue to drive growth.
“The North American region is estimated to account for the largest share of the aerial delivery drones market in 2019. The growth of the market in this region can be attributed to increased adoption of aerial delivery drones in the food, e-commerce, and logistics & transportation industries of countries such as the US and Canada for delivering their products to customers,” says the Markets and Markets summary.

 What holds MaaS together is the underlying digital mobility platform that is open, data-driven and capable of providing a level playing field for all service providers for the benefit of citizens. 

By Emmanuel de Roquefeuil
According to an estimate, India’s urban population will increase from 377 million in 2011 to 594 million in 2036 – a growth of 57 percent. This will be a significant addition of people to cities already stressed with limited resources. Amongst others, traffic congestion is already one of the foremost challenges to city authorities. Longer journeys raised levels of pollution, a higher number of automobile accidents, and a lowered quality of life would be among those challenges requiring the urgent attention of city planners and authorities.
The country, having seen rapid urbanization, is expected to keep adding people to its bustling cities even as the novel coronavirus halts, and indeed reverses, albeit temporarily, a migration to the country’s urban areas. This may clog India’s urban streets in the future and prevent mobility from providing what it essentially should: freedom of movement.
Today in India, we are faced with a couple of situations when it comes to urban mobility. On one hand, we have multiple modes of travel ranging from private vehicles like bikes and cars to public transport like metro rail and buses. On the other hand, we have a discerning urban commuter with expectations of commutes that can be customized, are sustainable and importantly, accessible via phones.
Not all of this is easy with differing modes of payment and challenges with route planning. This often leads to people falling back to their private cars and other forms of transport even if there are better options available. The statistics are telling: on an average India adds more than 50,000 cars per day adding to the congestion and pollution on its streets.
As the country looks forward to develop the smart cities of the future, what can be the option to plan your travel or daily commute in a better way? One that considers different modes of travel and the associated planning and payments in a seamlessly integrated manner on a single platform which could belike a smartphone app.
This is the premise of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) where different forms of transport are presented as options before the traveler on a single and integrated platform. This service can be anchored around a core of metros, buses and trains and complemented by shared services like cars and bikes. This ties in both public and private transport modes to present suitable options to the traveler.
The user needs to access MaaS on his or her phone, plan the journey, make payments using the phone itself, and simply switch between travelling modes to reach the destination. This is beneficial for both the traveler and the city authorities, as travel becomes more efficient and more sustainable.
What holds MaaS together is the underlying digital mobility platform – which is open, data-driven and capable of providing a level playing field for all service providers for the benefit of citizens. Above all, the platform must be cyber-secure to safeguard the privacy of users. Thales, a recognized player in the field of cybersecurity, relies on its expertise and its research laboratories in defense to offer all its customers robust solutions that allow them to benefit from the advantages of modern signaling  and digitalization.
It is this platform that offers route planning, booking, ticketing, customer services and payment on a single platform. Services can be consumed on the go, or bundled into a product or subscription and consumed as-a-service. This one platform must consider aspects like mode of transport, price, journey duration and real-time traffic and weather conditions.
For its effective performance, this platform needs to have certain attributes.
It must also allow for interoperability by defining standards that bring together diverse offerings and technologies seamlessly. It must also be able to improve the overall transport ecosystem and user experience by leveraging the rich depository of analytical data that it will hold. Entry barriers must also be lowered to enable participation from diverse transport providers. Lastly, as a repository of data, the platform should be secure and trustworthy.
To account for the rising population, and hence the number of commuters, of our cities, the system must also be scalable, modular and have an open cloud-based architecture to account for the rise in the number of mobility users. At the same time, authorities should be able to easily integrate the system into existing revenue collection systems to provide a seamless fare collection stream.
All this must happen while providing sufficiently high levels of cyber security to protect the privacy of users. The approach should be to address cyber security concerns at every stage of the information security lifecycle. Thus ‘Mobility as a Service’ platforms can enable city transport authorities and citizens to cope with the growth of mobility demand and traffic congestion in the coming years.

The startup TuSimple is deploying tractor-trailers that drive themselves from pickup to delivery
 By Evan Ackerman
Companies like Tesla, Uber, Cruise, and Waymo promise a future where cars are essentially mobile robots that can take us anywhere with a few taps on a smartphone. But a new category of vehicles is about to overtake self-driving cars in that leap into the future. Autonomous trucks have been quietly making just as much, if not more, progress toward commercial deployment, and their impact on the transportation of goods will no doubt be profound.
Among nearly a dozen companies developing autonomous trucking, San Diego–based TuSimple is trying to get ahead by combining unique technology with a series of strategic partnerships. Working with truck manufacturer Navistar as well as shipping giant UPS, TuSimple is already conducting test operations in Arizona and Texas, including depot-to-depot autonomous runs. These are being run under what’s known as “supervised autonomy,” in which somebody rides in the cab and is ready to take the wheel if needed. Sometime in 2021, the startup plans to begin doing away with human supervision, letting the trucks drive themselves from pickup to delivery without anybody on board.
Both autonomous cars and autonomous trucks rely on similar underlying technology: Sensors—typically cameras, lidars, and radars—feed data to a computer, which in turn controls the vehicle using skills learned through a massive amount of training and simulation. In principle, developing an autonomous truck can be somewhat easier than developing an autonomous car. 
That’s because unlike passenger vehicles, trucks—in particular long-haul tractor-trailers—generally follow fixed routes and spend most of their time on highways that are more predictable and easier to navigate than surface streets. Trucks are also a better platform for autonomy, with their large size providing more power for computers and an improved field of view for sensors, which can be mounted higher off the ground.
TuSimple claims that its approach is unique because its equipment is purpose built from the ground up for trucks. “Most of the other companies in this space got the seeds of their ideas from the DARPA Grand and Urban Challenges for autonomous vehicles,” says Chuck Price, chief product officer at TuSimple. “But the dynamics and functional behaviors of trucks are very different.”
The biggest difference is that trucks need to be able to sense conditions farther in advance, to allow for their longer stopping distance. The 200-meter practical range of lidar that most autonomous cars use as their primary sensor is simply not good enough for a fully loaded truck traveling at 120 kilometers per hour. Instead, TuSimple relies on multiple HD cameras that are looking up to 1,000 meters ahead whenever possible. The system detects other vehicles and calculates their trajectories at that distance, which Price says is approximately twice as far out as professional truck drivers look while driving.
Price argues that this capability gives TuSimple’s system more time to make decisions about the safest and most efficient way to drive. Indeed, its trucks use their brakes less often than trucks operated by human drivers, leading to improvements in fuel economy of about 10 percent. Steadier driving, with less side-to-side movement in a lane, brings additional efficiency gains while also minimizing tire wear. Price adds that autonomous trucks could also help address a shortage of truck drivers, which is expected to grow at an alarming rate.
TuSimple’s fleet of 40 autonomous trucks has been hauling goods between freight depots in Phoenix, Tucson, Dallas, El Paso, Houston, and San Antonio. These routes are about 95 percent highway, but the trucks can also autonomously handle surface streets, bringing their cargo the entire distance, from depot driveway to depot driveway. Its vehicles join a growing fleet of robotic trucks from competitors such as Aurora, Embark, Locomation, Plus.ai, and even Waymo, the Alphabet spin-off that has long focused on self-driving cars.
“I think there’s a big wave coming in the logistics industry that’s not necessarily well appreciated,” says Tasha Keeney, an analyst at ARK Invest who specializes in autonomous technology. She explains that electrified autonomous trucks have the potential to reduce shipping expenses not only when compared with those of traditional trucking but also with those of rail, while offering the door-to-door service that rail cannot. “The relationships that TuSimple has made within the trucking industry are interesting—in the long term, vertically integrated, purpose-built vehicles will have a lot of advantages.”
By 2024,TuSimple plans to achieve Level 4 autonomy, meaning that its trucks will be able to operate without a human driver under limited conditions that may include time of day, weather, or premapped routes. At that point, TuSimple would start selling the trucks to fleet operators. Along the way, however, there are several other milestones the company must hit, beginning with its first “driver out” test in 2021, which Price describes as a critical real-world demonstration.
“This is no longer a science project,” he says. “It’s not research. It’s engineering. The driver-out demonstration is to prove to us, and to prove to the public, that it can be done.”

  Autonomous vehicles are known for their slow speed 
Finnish self-driving tech company Sensible 4 — known for its award-winning software that enables autonomous driving in any weather conditions — predicts that smart cities will have a significant impact on the speed of autonomous vehicles.Sensible 4 software doesn’t need purpose-built infrastructure to drive autonomously, but at a later stage, relevant real-time data could improve the driving to higher standards.40 km/h works well in urban areasAutonomous vehicles are known for their slow speed. Most of the vehicles drive with a speed of 20 km/h and even Sensible 4’s faster autonomous vehicles driving 30-40 km/h can be considered to be slow — if compared to highway speeds that are 3-4 times higher.
“For public transportation in urban areas, our speed is enough and the speed is actually higher than other similar vehicles can reach currently,” Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, points out.
Autonomous vehicles anticipate traffic for two or three seconds into the future. In urban areas, where the speed limit is for example 30 or 40 km/h, the braking time and distance are short so stopping the vehicle can be executed safely and smoothly.
Smart cities support autonomous driving
Self-driving vehicles can, of course, drive faster, but to make it safe, it’s more complex. Autonomous driving doesn’t require smart city infrastructure and for example, Sensible 4’s software solution works without external supporting systems. However, at some point as a further step, smart cities can support autonomous driving and help to reach higher standards, like higher speed.
“Higher speeds require longer braking distance and time. This extends the requirements for predicting the traffic, which is impossible at highway speeds. To reach safe driving at higher speeds the autonomous vehicle would have to be sure there are no traffic disturbances ahead, far beyond the measuring distance of on-board sensors. For this we need smart infrastructure,” Santamala explains.
Countries and cities that want to be in the frontline on the new era of driving should start looking into options to support self-driving. Relevant real-time infrastructure data helps with predicting, avoiding incidents, and it can make driving more smooth and safe even at higher speeds.
This data could be for instance about the weather, traffic, and road condition — something that can make the vehicle perform even better. Smart cities can include information relayed to autonomous vehicles via high-speed 5G networks and fixed sensors for example in intersections.
“We believe that autonomous vehicles are on urban roads shortly, within a few years. Building smart cities require cooperation and time, so cities should start planning how their infrastructure supports these vehicles. Also, on the governmental level, the legislation should be prepared for the change,” Santamala states.

A wave of new innovations is enabling government leaders to implement “smart city” technology to improve services to their citizens, increase energy efficiency, and save money. Councils are using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and improved network traffic, energy, air quality, mobility, public infrastructure assets, and more.
All that data is being enhanced and optimised with powerful location intelligence and  management tools such as Confirm Asset Management. The net result is cost efficiency, and improved services.
Parking, public transportation and streetlights
It can be difficult to find a parking space in Barcelona, Spain. However, thanks to a network of smart sensors, information about available parking spaces is made available in real-time to drivers throughout the city. By directing residents to an open parking spot, the city is reducing traffic and pollution while saving its residents time.
Users of public transportation benefit from smart city technology as well. Sensors aboard city buses, for example, can detect whether a bus is ahead of schedule, behind schedule, or right on time. Armed with this information, many cities are providing notifications to users of public transportation, informing them of predicted arrival and departure times.
Some cities are even taking this a step further. If a bus is slightly ahead of schedule, for example, the timing of traffic lights can be adjusted slightly so that the bus is not compelled to sit idle at the next bus stop. 
In London and Quebec, energy-efficient smart streetlights are serving multiple purposes. Sensors detect the presence of pedestrians or vehicles, and the lights are dimmed or turned off when not needed. This feature alone can save as much as 30 per cent on energy costs. 
Smart streetlights are helping in other ways as well. They function as Wi-Fi hotspots and feature charging outlets for mobile phones and even electric vehicles. Surveillance cameras installed alongside the streetlights safeguard the community against crime. Some even have air quality sensors, providing valuable environmental data for city officials.
Smart waste management
While the examples cited above are easy to understand and resonate with a broad audience, there are plenty of other use cases that perhaps seem less cool, but which nevertheless have very real benefits for communities.
Many of us take for granted that when we toss a used coffee cup into a rubbish bin, someone will eventually turn up to empty the bin and take it away. Historically, that kind of service has been provided based on routinely scheduled operations. In other words, we can make a pretty good guess, based on history, as to when that rubbish bin will need to be emptied.
Logistically, there are several inefficiencies here. For one thing, a rubbish bin along the main thoroughfare might fill up much faster than one that is stationed only a block away.
This means that a rubbish truck may end up spending a good deal of its time servicing bins that are less than half-full.
The core problem, though, is that without smart technology, we really don’t know when any of the rubbish bins need to be emptied. If we add sensor technology and connectivity, we can have a real-time view of the city’s waste management needs. We can allocate resources where they are needed and when they are needed, rather than making a best guess about the situation. That saves time and money. With fewer rubbish collection vehicles on the road, it also reduces traffic congestion.
Bike-stands, trees and parking meters
When we start to drill down into all the various assets that are managed and serviced by governments and councils, public asset management begins to look like a daunting task. 
Technology can rein in that complexity. Many of the larger cities throughout the world have implemented bicycle sharing programs centered around public bike-docking kiosks. When someone rents or borrows a bicycle, those kiosks can detect how many bikes are available and share that information to mobile phone users throughout the city. Sensors installed on each bicycle can communicate maintenance requirements to city officials so that units can be efficiently and promptly repaired and put back in service. 
The same principles can be applied to virtually any public asset. Parking meters, for example, will stop producing revenue when they are out of service. By establishing two-way communication between devices such as parking meters and a central asset management system, city officials can be notified promptly of a needed repair and can use mobile technology to deploy maintenance crews in the area to fix the problem.
Trees also require regular maintenance. While it may not make sense to install IoT sensors in the city’s trees, the fundamental need for systems to manage scheduled maintenance remains.
By enabling the smart allocation of resources around maintenance tasks of any kind, local governments increase efficiency and save money.
How the City of Sydney uses infrastructure asset management technology
Sustainable Sydney 2030, a collective vision for “a green, global and connected Sydney” outlines the City of Sydney’s ambitious environmental, economic, social and cultural goals. It is based on a deep commitment to environmental leadership, high levels of service and quality facilities for the residents, businesses and visitors to one of the world’s most livable cities. 
To help realise this vision and comply with legislative mandates, the city must be able to manage the lifecycle of AU$12.7 billion worth of infrastructure assets. 
The City of Sydney selected the Confirm Asset Management platform to manage its wide range of assets and to deliver a mobile solution for the field-based asset managers and inspectors. 
Compounding benefits with location intelligence
All these connected technologies result in a high volume of information that was never available before. Consider what happens when we begin to combine that with some of the other location-based data available to city managers.
If we return to our bicycle sharing example, we might discover some interesting new possibilities. Let’s assume, for instance, that routine use of the bike-sharing service for one-way trips results in a surplus of bicycles in the waterfront area of the city. As a result, city workers must routinely pick up bikes from the waterfront, load them into a truck, and return them to kiosks in the downtown area. That’s a lot of work, and it costs money.
What if city managers were to analyse mobility data to understand where people are at various times of the day? What if they used that data to establish a schedule of incentive pricing for one-way bike trips back to downtown? To take this example a step further, program managers could use mobility services to promote the new incentive pricing to pedestrians who frequent the waterfront area.
The net result will be a win-win; more residents will benefit from using a community resource, and the city will save money in the process. When you consider the volume of data available through smart city technologies and combine that with external location data, a wealth of new opportunities emerges.

Cities across the globe have experienced a major setback due to the COVID-19 crisis. From global supply chains to the stock markets, a majority of day-to-day operations came to a screeching halt. However, different cities have responded to the pandemic in different ways. Several trends were triggered due to coronavirus, including a mass switch to remote workplaces and an emphasis on digital transformation as a whole. Smart cities were already working in the direction of entirely digitalizing urban mobility. Now, the pandemic provided a much-needed momentum to these efforts. Find out how Smart Cities level up in the COVID-19 crisis.
Urban mobility and the pandemic
The spread of coronavirus has dramatically impacted the mobility patterns across regions.
A vast majority of the working class switched to a “work from home” setting as business travel, domestic or international, came to a standstill for weeks altogether. Companies and employees accepted the remote work culture quite commendably. However, as the world is undergoing adjustments in the ‘new normal’ phase, safe mobility alternatives are being encouraged by the administrators globally.
Singapore’s Senior Minister of State, Dr.JanilPuthucheary, expressed the need for innovative planning models post COVID-19 in a speech in March 2020. He communicated the need to include the prospects of natural disasters/outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, while formulating future policy models. Also, he addressed the need for more flexibility in the transportation planning process to accommodate unprecedented circumstances.
New transportation and mobility solutions to get back on track
With the imminence of new technologies, services, and products, significant disruption is dawning upon the transportation sector. Governments across the nations have implemented new mobility systems. Policymakers are targeting convenient, cheaper, and more sustainable mobility alternativesfor their citizens.
Autonomous vehicles
Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been pilots for quite many years now. Nonetheless, the global pandemic has shown a considerable effect on the deployment of AVs across smart cities. The likelihood of AVs in public transport service, even after the containment of the coronavirus, has increased.
Public transit autonomous vehicles align with the safety measures of social distancing. For instance, the Jacksonville Transportation Authority (JTA) is carrying critical testing and medical supplies with the help of their AV fleet service provider — Beep and NAVYA (French AV builder). This has helped the authorities to keep their staff members safe from exposure to the contagious virus. The AVs will eventually become part of the Ultimate Urban Circulator program of JTA.
MaaS
MaaS or ‘mobility as a service’ saw a shift in consumer behavior with less traffic during the lockdown. However, electric scooters or bike-share, among other micro-mobility services, have expanded their horizons to serve vulnerable localities.
Provisions for cleanliness with frequent sanitization and physical distancing with glass shields between passengers and drivers emerged as the simplest way to utilize public and shared transportation. Mobility aggregator apps allow users to schedule journeys using a wide range of modes of transport and to select routes that fit the social distancing criteria. MaaS has offered convenient and cheap modes of transportation with the reliability of safety to people and has public mobility getting back on track at a notable pace.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) at service
Sophisticated technologies such as deep learning and AI are being proactively implemented in the public transport sector.
In terms of proactive safety management, AI is being used to record the temperature of boarding passengers through thermal-screening cameras. A more advanced approach- ThermalPass, utilizes sensors to assess external body temperature through the radiated heat. Furthermore, to replace human contact, touchless ticketing systems, special travel cards (like Singapore’s ez-link card), and cashless payment options are used. Employing AI to regulate the use of public transport for maximum operational efficiency has also paid off well for technologically-rich regions.
Further, actionable insights into mobility demand such as the estimated time to the destination location, and AI-based sensors to guide travelers to practice social distancing in queues and waiting areas are under implementation across smart cities.
Other critical advancements include automated securement systems for wheelchairs to omit the need for human contact. Several technology-powered mobility solutions are on the cards to get the mobility and transportation sector back on track.
The bottom line
Governments have done their bit by offering discounted fares to free transport for health care and essential workers. However, without the enablement of technological solutions, achieving desired outcomes is challenging. Cities and regions that were undertaking ‘smart city’ initiatives, before the spread of coronavirus, are revisiting their urban mobility planning models to incorporate touchless or low-contact tech solutions. 
Defining a sustainable future mobility model and tackling the immediate effect of COVID-19 is a collective effort of human and technological resources in smart cities. On these grounds, smart cities are undeniably ahead of competition with their tech-enabled transport and mobility measures. You might have got the about how smart cities level up in the COVID-19 crisis.

Vehicles are getting connected. That’s a good thing. But they are getting connected in haphazard and slapdash ways, and that’s not good at all. Each car has multiple connectivity needs and, to date, car makers tend to satisfy each need by adding another, different connection. The electronics industry is eager to provide consolidated connectivity solutions, but most major automobile companies remain dedicated to developing proprietary technologies, which means auto makers and their suppliers are figuratively reinventing the wheel on a constant basis.
What follows is an overview of the connectivity requirements by the automobile industry. We then compare several solutions offered by some of the more prominent vendors in the electronics industry.
Why connect?
In-vehicle infotainment systems and telematics units have become top priority for over-the-air (OTA) software updates. Carmakers plan to add new apps and services — ranging from car-sharing to detecting fuel levels — without redesigning the car. A flood of audio and video streaming media — via Wi-Fi, 4G and 5G — is washing over vehicles.
Cybersecurity demands OTA. When there’s a hack, nothing is more important to car OEMs than the agility to send software patches — stat. For software-rich vehicles, OTA is their BFF. Because there is no such thing as bug-free software, vehicles must be prepared to correct software errors.
The next frontier of OTA updates is happening in the whole car. Carmakers need to be able to target not just TCUs (telematics control units) but also the various ECUs, developed by different chip vendors, installed in each vehicle. These ECUs are tasked to control various parts of a vehicle, ranging from engine control to air bags and seat adjustments.
Connectivity must go two ways. Besides the ability to send software patches, carmakers must be able to extract information from vehicles. In the era of highly automated vehicles, massive sensory data generated by cameras, radars and lidars needs to be aggregated, processed, stored and sent to the cloud for AI training. Possibly in a consistent format.
Last but not least, data collected by connected vehicles must be analyzed.
In short, connected cars cover a lot of ground. Connectivity empowers the automotive industry to develop and add new apps and services. Connectivity supports road safety, sends cybersecurity fixes, and advances machine learning. “Car-to-cloud” connected vehicles are a huge market. Every tech supplier, OEM, tier one and tier two is chipping away at it.
Painting a rosy future for connected vehicles is easy. More difficult is figuring out which connectivity solutions are doing what. Bear in mind that no one has gotten all the connectivity pieces down. Anyone who claims to have an “end-to-end” solution doesn’t.
Tower of Babel
At issue is not a lack of building blocks to design connected vehicles. The real concern is that carmakers — as they have done for decades — continue to develop proprietary solutions designed for one but exclude the rest of the industry.
Players in the connected vehicle field — car OEMs, tier ones and tier twos — are building a “Tower of Babel,” observed Mark Singer, director of marketing at Excelfore. An OTA software update solution offered by one company, or designed for one model, for example, does not necessarily talk to another model even within the same company.
Three driving forces for connectivity
The lay of land for connected vehicles is complex. There are, however, three key forces driving vehicles to connect to the cloud.
First is the emergence of “software-defined” vehicles. “Cars are becoming software,” said Raj Kanaya, general manager of automotive and chief marketing officer at Aeris.
Second, 5G and the “infinite scalability of the Internet,” as Harman calls it, are making carmakers rethink how to deliver features and content to a vehicle. Tim Van Goethem, vice president, advanced mobility solutions at Harman, sees the promise of 5G and the Internet enabling car OEMs to “keep adding new features to a vehicle throughout its entire life cycle.”
Third, “data is reshaping the autonomous vehicle (AV) value chain.” Massive data collected for AV applications is making the cloud “an essential building block,” as Danny Kim, partner and director at VSI Labs noted in his company’s technology brief.
Against this backdrop, we will examine who’s who in the connected vehicle market, while breaking down who’s addressing which segments of the car-to-cloud conundrum.
Qualcomm’s Car-to-Cloud Platform
Qualcomm launched its Car-to-Cloud Platform this month at CES.
If you are naïve enough to believe that the vehicle of the future is “a smartphone on wheels,” you might conclude that Qualcomm leading the car-to-cloud revolution is a no-brainer. Hold that thought.
When EE Times asked Qualcomm which parts of the connected vehicle market its Car-to-Cloud Platform is designed to address, Nimish Shrivastava, senior director of product management, gave a measured response. Qualcomm’s immediate mission is to enable carmakers to boost their vehicle’s connectivity performance from 4G to 5G without car OEMs having to change the hardware.

Shrivastava said Qualcomm’s Car-to-Cloud Platform has two key features. One is something called “Soft SKU.” The other is security directly built into connectivity chips. Soft SKU lets field-upgradeable chips “securely support new functionality as performance requirements increase or new features become available.” It ensures a smooth transition from 4G to 5G and enables “regional customization and feature upgrades tailored for specific product segments,” according to Qualcomm. By leveraging its capabilities, OEMs can customize a single SKU for multiple tiers and markets. That, in the end, will help automakers save costs associated with dedicated investments in multiple SKUs, Qualcomm claimed.
Qualcomm’s Car-to-Cloud platform also gives carmakers a flexible way to provision data usage. Shrivastava explained that it’s probably not okay for carmakers to charge consumers for the data usage in OTA updates, for example. Connected car vendors should offer different billing systems, while providing plans to bundle data, services and new user experiences in a flexible manner, said Shrivastava.
Too little too late?
Incumbents of the connected vehicle business see Qualcomm’s entry in the crowded connected vehicle market as “too little, too late.” Greg Basich, associate director of automotive practice at Strategy Analytics, pointed out Qualcomm’s inexperience in managing the lifecycle of a vehicle. Qualcomm also lacks knowledge of ECUs supplied by different chip vendors and designed into different vehicles. Supporting Qualcomm’s own chip in its own Car-to-Cloud platform is one thing. Presenting itself as a serious car-to-cloud panacea for the whole industry is entirely another. “Qualcomm’s car-to-cloud service must be decoupled with Qualcomm’s own chip,” Basich said.
Shrivastava acknowledged the need for Qualcomm’s platform to support other chips in the future. But for now, Qualcomm sees its mission in filling certain gaps it has found in current telematics solutions. Soft SKU will be important for Qualcomm, because all major OEMs are scrambling to make their connected vehicles “future proof.” With Soft SKU’s ability to activate new features – as needed – at device level, Qualcomm will add “life-time value” to their chips deployed in connected cars, Shrivastava said.
Given the complexity of vehicle architecture, the automotive industry can’t simply re-purpose OTA update technology originally invented for mobile phones. That mobile OTA technology cannot update, for example, brake systems, because it lacks the means to extract the necessary delta from a variety of ECUs, whose resources — memory and processing power — are severely constrained.
Nonetheless, Shrivastava insisted that Qualcomm knows something about “bringing different players together” in the “ecosystem.” Qualcomm hopes to replicate in the automotive ecosystem its own success in bringing network operators, content owners and software developers together to enable advancements in features and content of smartphones.
VW-Aeris joint venture
Earlier this week, Volkswagen Group of America announced the formation of a joint venture, called Ventic LLC, with Aeris.
The new JV grew out of a relationship VW had with Aeris. In 2017, the two companies worked together to develop “an IoT platform” to support the embedded connectivity module in cars, a VW spokesperson explained. The JV’s work will include “OTA updates to the embedded connectivity module,” she added.
Beyond that, both VW and Aeris declined to detail Ventic’s mission.
The idea to form a JV appears to have come from both companies’ top management. The decision parallels a major organizational shift announced by VW last fall “to bring hardware and software design all in house.”
Aeris is a “world-class software company” which has gained credibility among automotive OEMs, Kanaya asserted. To enable car-to-cloud, Aeris offers a mobile suite consisting of TCU and platforms for connectivity, devices and mobile applications. So far, Aeris’ connectivity platform has earned design wins among many car OEMs, said Kanaya. Since 2017 when Aeris struck a deal with Mitsubishi Motors, it has been rolling out additional device and mobile application layers atop the connectivity platform. Aeris also offers “cloud-independent” solutions to customers.

As comprehensive as Aeris’ block diagram above looks in terms of supporting new applications and services in vehicles, Aeris’ solutions remain focused on the TCU.
Phil Magney, the founder of VSI Labs, told EE Times that the VW-Aeris JV is “all about creating a unified telematics platform to support current and future connected services.” This, however, does not support “the iterative data handling cycles necessary to manage a software-defined vehicle architecture,” he added.
Put simply, it’s not built for whole-car OTA updates.
Knowing OEMs’ workflow
Asked why Aeris has not ventured into enabling OTA software updates on a variety of ECUs, Kanaya said that the current car architecture can’t yet support it. Whole-car OTA updates must wait for the consolidation of more ECUs inside a vehicle, and for the in-vehicle network architecture to get upgraded.
Where Aeris’ expertise shines, however, is its understanding of OEM workflow, Kanaya explained. If an OEM is adding new features to100,000 vehicles over the air, the process must mesh with the carmaker’s workflow — database, notification, detecting if updates failed or succeeded, etc.
Asked about Aeris’ technical edge, he pointed out, “We have the ability to add new services very quickly.” While end users often suffer from a longer response time to get software updates — sometimes as long as 30 seconds to one minute, Kanaya stated, “We’ve optimized the process to less than three seconds.”
Competitive landscape
So, who does Aeris compete against in the field of OTA updates for connected vehicles? Kanaya said, “We mostly compete with car OEMs and tier ones who are developing their own OTA solutions.”
This walled-garden approach, still prevalent in the auto industry, seems an antiquated business practice. But the reality is, as Strategy Analytics’ Basich explained, “Automakers hate to use something developed or used by other automakers, even if the technology is free and open.”
There is no shortage of examples of carmakers pursuing their own OTA solutions in collaboration with tech suppliers. They include Ford-Autonomic-AWS partnership, Jaguar Land Rover-CloudCar.
BlackBerry, QNX and AWS unveiled a new partnership at the CES earlier this month. The deal, aimed at automotive OEMs, promises to deliver “services, personalization, health monitoring, and advanced driver assistance (ADAS) in vehicles.”
Wind River and Airbiquity announced their own partnership last year, promising a “software lifecycle management solution for connected and autonomous vehicles, one that spans vehicle to cloud.” Under the agreement, Wind River contributes a highly modular, OTA update and software lifecycle management solution. Airbiquity provides “OTA orchestration, campaign management, software and data management, and Uptane-based security framework capabilities.”
300 million connected vehicles
All that said and done, it’s hard to beat Harman, a Samsung company, according to Strategy Analytics’ Basich. Harman’s remote vehicle update service, already selected by 23 major global OEMs, manages more than 30 million connected vehicles. In the eyes of Harman, connected vehicles are already here. It expects the number of connected cars to grow to 300 million in the next five years.
Harman does everything from personalized cloud content to new apps and services configured in the vehicle. But does Harman cover OTA updates on ECUs? That appears to be a different story. It hasn’t happened yet in the current-generation connected vehicles.
It’s the data pipeline, stupid!
In Strategy Analytics’ Basich’s mind, OTA updates for a whole car fall into an entirely different bucket. Excelfore and Aurora Labs are the companies leading that charge.
Excelfore’s Singer observed that few in the automotive industry are focusing on developing a coherent data pipeline that connects from server in the cloud to vehicles, and vehicles to devices inside a vehicle.
Car OEMs tend to be opportunistic, developing a proprietary solution for the moment’s needs. If they build a data pipeline, it serves one purpose in each new model in each new car.
The industry, however, must move faster to whole-car updates and data gathering, according to Excelfore’ Singer. He pointed out that if automakers are serious about perfecting autonomous driving technology, they must be able to pull data — how the software is performing in the real world — consistently. “It bothers me that the automotive industry is talking up autonomous driving, and yet they haven’t even figured out how to do the whole-car OTA updates, or extracting data from a vehicle” in a consistent manner, he said.
Common protocols
The first step in this journey is for the industry to devise a common protocol for messaging over the data pipeline. It must allow the server to talk to each client in the same language, while letting the server probe for the presence of a certain ECU or a sensor inside a vehicle. That probing must take place in order to assess each ECU’s ability to process OTA software.

OTA software updates for the whole car are not as simple as just downloading software updates. In explaining his company’s mission, Aurora Labs’ CEO Zohar Fox once asked following questions:
Can current OTA update solutions roll back to a previous software version if a problem occurs with the new version? Can they avoid re-distribution of the previous software versions, and write them again on the flash?
Is it possible to update new functionality without rebooting?
Can the solution support different car ECUs: infotainment, safety, powertrain, ADAS, chassis, body and comfort? More important, can it support such ECUs today and in the future, using the same technology?
Can the OTA-update solution meet the reflash time and power requirements of the production line? Can the ECUs be updated with the latest software versions prior to leaving the factor?
Does the OTA solution require client integration work by all ECU vendors in the vehicle ecosystem?
All these questions remain relevant for anyone who tries to do whole-car OTA updates.
It’s critical to proactively analyze the health and performance of lines-of-code deployed on Automotive ECUs (Source: Aurora Labs)
Excelfore is achieving this by building a client-server architecture and creating an abstraction layer that allows a software “agent” to know specific characteristics of a device in a vehicle. This lets Excelfore send various car OEMs’ OTA software updates directly from the company’s eSync cloud platform to different electronics devices.
Aurora Labs, in contrast, is working similarly, not by creating software agents but by compiling a software library including codes from different ECUs, explained Strategy Analytics’ Basich. “It’s a very unique approach.”
Excelfore, in early 2018, provided the company’s eSync technology to an open trade association called eSync Alliance. The Alliance is making steady progress, according to Singer.
As for eSync market deployment, Singer said, “We expect to see five automakers shipping eSync-based vehicles in 2020 in China, Japan and Europe.”
None in the United States yet, however. Last fall, FAW, one of China’s largest automotive manufacturers, announced deployment of the eSync platform. FAW’s new cars, currently in production, allow OTA updates targeting 33 devices — from 24 different suppliers — designed into a vehicle, Singer boasted.
Strategy Analytics’ Basich concluded that although whole-car OTA updates appear slow in coming, recently announced automotive processors will soon realize the next-generation automotive architecture. Whether it is NXP Semiconductors’ new gateway processors, or Texas Instruments’ ADAS and gateway processors, semiconductor suppliers rolling out these new chips know they must make the automotive industry’s number one wish — over-the-air software updates — come true, à la Tesla. Every OEM is jockeying to make their vehicles software upgradeable.

Big data is offering many very promising opportunities for the fleet management industry in the face of great uncertainty. 
 By Ryan Kh 
According to a forecast by IDC and Seagate Technology, the global data sphere will grow more than fivefold in the next seven years. The total amount of new data will increase to 175 zettabytes by 2025, up from 33 zettabytes in 2018.
This ever-growing volume of information has given rise to the concept of big data. And I do not mean large amounts of information per se, but rather data that is processed at high speed and has a strong variability. Nowadays, managers across industries rely on information systems such as CRMs to improve their business processes. The domain of logistics is no stranger to innovations either.
Within the industry, the management of data allows T&L businesses to take productivity, efficiency, and safety to a whole new level. Besides, the analysis of data is beneficial for the bottom line as it cuts unnecessary costs and expenses.
It won’t be an exaggeration to say that big data has reinvented the way a modern fleet operates. Big data eliminates all the guesswork and allows fleet managers to make purely informed decisions. So, without further ado, let’s see how it works in detail.
Maintenance
All in all, the concept of big data is all about predictive analytics. Such data is great for introducing revamped maintenance practices. Thanks to the availability of comparative data for practically every type/model of a vehicle, fleet managers can plan maintenance activities based on certain knowledge. This practice results in lowered maintenance costs for fleets of any size. What’s even more important, predictive analytics prevents accidents on the road. This way, company drivers feel that they work in safe conditions.
Predictive analytics takes care of both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include depreciation, interest, repair and maintenance costs, tire changes, insurance, fuel, taxes, and fees. Indirect costs are usually more difficult to calculate, but they have a significant impact on the bottom line and include administrative staff time, driver downtime, etc.
The industry is continually changing, so if you want to successfully plan your budget, it is essential to effectively use the available funds in the present. Undoubtedly, the cost of maintaining a fleet depends on many factors, but data helps you figure out what works best for your fleet here and now.
Fuel Management
Fuel costs are rising globally. According to statistics, fuel costs account for nearly 40% of overall expenses for a fleet. The proper data analysis provides fleet managers with an opportunity to monitor the total fuel costs and see the weak points. For instance, it’s easier to identify idling trucks that waste fuel.
Data also helps in identifying improper routing that usually leads to excessive fuel consumption. Statistics reveal that companies relying on data management reduce total miles driven by 10%. Finally, data management helps fleet managers analyze fuel price fluctuations so that they can plan budgets wisely.
Safe Driving
There’s no use to explain why safe driving is important, and big data helps to outline the behavior patterns of drivers. With that info at hand, the introduction of proper training within a fleet is just a matter of time. Telematics via sensors installed in a truck provides exact data on drivers’ behavior. Here we talk about such parameters as vehicle speed, acceleration, braking, fuel consumption, and other nuances that allow you to build a “profile” of the driver.
For example, drivers who violate speed limits and drive aggressively do waste more fuel than the ones that drive responsibly. And I don’t even mention that it’s dangerous. It’s an absolute necessity to persuade their drivers to be safe and efficient on the road. Telematics go as far as restricting using phone calls or texts while on the route.
To Sum Up
Industry professionals claim that data is “the new oil,” and one couldn’t agree more. The only challenge is just learning how to use it effectively. There are no universal algorithms for exploring data. However, managing your fleet using Big Data gets so much easier if you are using proper fleet management software. With such solutions, fleet managers can classify all the data and make a list of business goals to reach. Data analysis is a field for imagination: as a fleet manager, you need to think, build and test hypotheses taking into account the specifics of the T&L industry.
In the era of big data, advanced data analytics enable multiple decisions to be made throughout the vehicle’s lifecycle. The data collected from vehicles means preventive maintenance, and managers can know all about their fleets and alert the relevant authorities in case of accidents.

The market size for autonomous last-mile delivery is intensifying day by day and is expected to grow to almost 85 U.S. billion dollars by 2030. The demand for autonomous last-mile delivery occurred at an even faster pace than we expected back in 2016. For example, autonomous robots and drones were conceptual in 2016, and now, we see the large-scale deployment of robotics and drones in last-mile deliveries. 
The last-mile delivery process is coined as the most integral part of present-day shipping companies. Today logistic companies’ are not only focusing on shipments from the transport hub, but they are also testing a series of technology solutions at every stage of last-mile delivery.  This kind of extensive growth makes the last-mile carrier a strength for all retail companies, not a setback. The goal will be to deploy technology solutions that could minimize the delivery time, ensure transparency, and minimize cost with smart vehicles for last-mile operations.
The New Generation of Last-Mile Delivery
As a share of operational shipping costs, the last-mile delivery costs are substantial and 53% overall. New technologies, software, and tools, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, can quickly identify inefficiencies in the last-mile algorithms. In this post, you’ll see how AI can be applied in practical situations to minimize problems in last-mile delivery. The new generation of AI will give retailers the ability to optimize their last-mile carrier, leading to the simplification of processes and performance.
To survive the market competition, supply chain enterprises are only left with the option of optimizing last-mile delivery with technology solutions, including AI and machine learning. Successful last-mile strategy pillars are determined by speed, accuracy, efficiency, transparency, and, most importantly, a positive customer experience. Covid-19 and lockdown have changed the usual shopping ways and added more pressure on supply chain companies to ensure faster and more quick last-mile deliveries for customers.    
Technology trends, especially AI in the last-mile, stood out during this disruptive phase of the pandemic. Whether big or small, supply chain enterprises must implement AI technology for improved last-mile operations in the future. We’ve all heard of stories of deliveries not showing up on time. This puts pressure on logistics companies to make it right. In this line, NextBillion AI, an industry-leading startup, recently announces custom map API solutions for telematics and last-mile logistics. The global geocode API solutions handle factors such as inconsistency in managing hours of operations, drive-pattern, and drive-time by using the advanced ML algorithm. 
Let’s speak about the Amazon delivery that has begun using AI-equipped cameras across its delivery fleets. This allowed Amazon to scale up their last-mile deliveries as cameras are equipped with artificial intelligence software capable of detecting 16 different safety issues, including distracted driving, hard braking, and whether the driver is not wearing a seatbelt.
A Constantly Changed Landscape of AI in Last-Mile
Smarter ways of last-mile delivery are coming up. Implementation of AI in last-mile logistics is gaining momentum. In the coming years, there will be increased adoption of artificial intelligence for improved last-mile fulfillment. Smart tech optimizes not-mile operations and reduces human dependency that can fetch great business results in the long run. Today, enterprises consider investing in Artificial Intelligence to optimize their last-mile operations. Here is how it works.
Artificial Intelligence processes machines and software systems using human intelligence. AI has changed the ways businesses handle their logistics. This technology has the maximum impact on a company’s last-mile operations and, in the process, optimizes issues such as routing, visibility, allocation of resources, and parcel sorting. Here we will see how AI in the last-mile delivery can help logistics companies make significant optimization to compete effectively.
AI Led Geocoding
The complexity of the supply chain process increases with the number of drop locations. As the shipping volume increases, the last-mile deliveries can get complicated when distributions to be done in remote areas. The customers also write unclear addresses. Location is crucial to logistics companies and service providers looking to tailor the final steps of last-mile delivery to their customers. With Artificial Intelligence and algorithms-led geocoding, even the unclear of addresses can be converted into precise locations on a map. Accurate AI-enabled geocoding helps delivery companies to reach customer destinations faster, which leads to a higher delivery rate.
Geocoding helps to maintain accurate address information to improve accuracy in the final steps of delivery to customers in the digital age. On the other hand, inaccurate data can result in late or no deliveries and poor communication with customers.
Geocoding provides you not only precise location data but also enables the validation of pickup and delivery addresses. Geofencing is another critical component of a delivery network that ensures real-time pickup and delivery notification, reducing wait time for drivers and lowering shippers’ costs. Ingeocoding, AI aims to find and gather insights to build the best possible geospatial data by detecting patterns, outliers, and trends and understanding the distribution of data across cities, states, or countries.
The second thing is to get the data on a map. The technology helps create a map with a location that can be the center point of your data. Users can add the points to the map. With these technological features, we can make critical decisions to gather data insights.
Using AI in Geocoding, businesses can identify segmentation patterns and plot points on a map more effectively. Also, it is useful in fraud prevention by identifying unusual activity on a customer location. 
AI-Backed Route Planning & Optimization
Thanks to Artificial Intelligence, route planning, and optimization are simpler and more useful than ever. AI route planning facilitates on-time deliveries even when companies deal with a high volume of packages and heavy traffic congestion. Route optimization is one of the most important advancements within logistics technology, coupled with continued improvements in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. The ability to automatically plan optimal last-mile delivery routes is significantly improving than ever before. 
As the eCommerce supply chain and logistics industry experienced the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic, those involved in the business realized the importance of planning and preparing better for the future. Traditionally eCommerce companies relied on zip codes for the last-mile delivery of shipments. But today, companies started creating their zones or warehouses for last-mile deliveries. However, for delivery during the festive season, hefty volumes throw off the company’s zones. This is why companies search for route optimization software that guarantees optimal delivery routes and automated recommendations for the best-suited vehicle based on the volume of shipment, delivery requirements, geographical conditions, and shipment type.
One central area of AI in route planning and optimization is creating plans and routes according to driver requirements. With Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, logistics companies can plan routes based on the driver’s performance and multiple variables. This technology trend will set companies to ensure faster last-mile delivery by utilizing real-time data and historical patterns for planning and optimization. This saves time, and more importantly, less time spend on route planning and optimization means less expenditure, fewer drivers paid hours, and less demand for delivery vehicles.      
AI to Gain Last-Mile Visibility 
Last-Mile visibility is the ability to track products during transit. Today, 93% of consumers want to stay more informed about their products’ location throughout the delivery process. This puts pressure on organizations to gain last-mile visibility from in-transit status to final delivery of products. Last-mile visibility is backed by AI and machine learning that allows for tracking and tracing parcels in real-time and identify issues in the process, thereby allowing companies to take proactive action to prevent customer pain.
According to a survey by Capgemini, 83% of shippers believe that last-mile visibility is a crucial factor for growth. The technology-backed solution for fleet tracking offers multiple checkpoints for tracking a package when it is received or transferred to its final destination. Customers will be alerted with emails and notifications that provide visibility throughout the delivery stages in real-time. For example, FedEx uses a tracking tool, InSight, that utilizes reference numbers for tracking orders. Amazon delivers a MapTracker to guide a delivery driver about the dropoff destination. Amazon Locker is a tool that alerts customers via text messages and emails when their package is dropped off at their residence or any other location for pickup. 
As AI continues turning businesses around, it has been proven that companies have nothing to fear for unpredictability in tackling routes, weather, and address related issues. As the market moves toward a more automated future, retailers will need to tackle these challenges with technology-backed solutions to work toward perfecting their last-mile delivery, which can further refine their last-mile visibility and transparency. If done well, this results in improved accuracy and profits and proves to be a competitive advantage for any organization.
Conclusion: Think Outside the Box
The future of your eCommerce business is in your hands now. To stay competitive, retailers will need to invest in AI-backed last-mile strategies. Several useful AI and ML applications exist in today’s landscape that aid a shipping company to ensure that deliveries are completed with full transparency and visibility. So, think out of the box with AI and machine learning that simplifies human efforts in the last-mile logistics operations and ultimately paves the way for businesses.

The world has long been waiting for the 5G mobile broadband network. As consumers clamor for better services and faster delivery of goods, a lot of industries have been hoping to speed up their internet connections to meet this demand. Thankfully, the dawn of 5G is upon us.Gartner’s predictive analysis reveals that 5G networks will start to roll out this 2020 through network-based mobile communications service providers. Through this, 20.4 billion connected things will be spread out and utilized all over the world. Certainly, the 5G mobile broadband network will soon become the industry standard ⁠— especially in smart cities ⁠— so supply chain players need to carefully strategize in order to fully utilize this technology.Organizations, people, and activities that are directly connected to the supply chain will benefit greatly from the 5G mobile network, no matter how big or small their enterprises are. Here, we’ll take a look at how 5G is set to revolutionize how supply chains work.
Enhance LogisticsOne way that 5G is set to improve the supply chain is by upgrading the logistics tech that transportation and delivery industries use. As companies constantly track and trace products to ensure successful delivery, a lot of pressure has been put in keeping this process optimized to prevent customer dissatisfaction and failure to provide goods. With 5G, supply chain enterprises will have higher visibility the minute a delivery truck departs a warehouse, guaranteeing a seamless transition from one location to another.As 5G offers an almost instantaneous connection between logistic teams, delays in delivery and scheduling can now be mitigated. Furthermore, artificial intelligence-led projects like self-driving trucks ⁠— which will soon be a smart city staple and were pioneered by Kodiak Robotics in 2018 ⁠— will be safer, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly if connection is done through the 5G network.Improve Communication Between FleetsCommunication is vital in the supply chain, as miscommunication causes delays in operations, which in turn, spell massive dips in profits for various industries. As 5G connects users with groundbreaking speeds, there’s a significantly lower chance for communication mishaps to happen. Furthermore, 5G allows teams to send and receive information almost instantaneously.With this, fleets can communicate tons of useful information as soon as their sensors pick up data, which can also lead to a huge efficiency boost. An article titled ‘The Intelligent Fleet: Bridging the Communications Gap’ by Verizon Connect points out how this can lead to performance insights being applied immediately across fleets and drivers. 
The end result, then, would be that logistics fleets would be constantly updated with the best schedules, routes, and ways to deliver goods. In smart cities where efficiency is highly regarded, the benefits of 5G networks in keeping supply chain fleets connected will further drive higher profits for the affected enterprises.Better Inventory Management
5G will also change the way supply chain industries approach inventory and warehouse management. For one, the technology used in logistics is closely tied with the one used for tracking goods in the warehouse, so 5G’s superior network will be incredibly beneficial in making collection, delivery, and archiving more efficient. Inbound and outbound goods will be managed with ease, and collection of data insights to improve operations (just like how smart cities improve their infrastructure and public service) will all be faster if done through the 5G network.
Another great application of 5G in warehouse management is the use of augmented reality (AR) to keep track of goods inside the warehouses. A GS1 survey reports that the average inventory accuracy only lands at 63%, so supply chain warehouses need new tech to help raise this statistic. Thankfully, we have AR to supplement this. Coupled with 5G, AR allows warehouse managers to have a visual of their environment with information through computer-generated graphics. So in real-time, warehouse workers can plan a warehouse’s layout of goods in advance by superimposing computer-generated photos of the products on shelves and storage.
Overall, 5G is more than just a step forward into the future. As this technology mitigates communication loss and enhances internet speeds, industries involved in the supply chain can make leaps and bounds in improving their services, encourage more efficient operations, and drive higher profits.

For self-driving vehicles, full autonomy might not be quite as full as you think
In January, Waymo posted a tweet breaking down what “autonomy” means for the Waymo Driver, which is how the company refers to its autonomous driving system. The video in the Tweet points out that Level 1, 2, and 3 autonomy are not “fully autonomous” because a human driver might be needed. Sounds good. The Waymo Driver operates at Level 4 autonomy, meaning, Waymo says, that “no human driver is needed in our defined operational conditions.” This, Waymo continues, represents “fully autonomous driving technology,” with the Waymo Driver being “fully independent from a human driver.” 
Using the term “full autonomy” in the context of autonomous vehicles can be tricky. Depending on your perspective, a vehicle with Level 4 autonomy fundamentally cannot be called “fully” autonomous, because it’s autonomous in some situations and not others, which is where the defined operational conditions bit comes in. The folks behind these levels of autonomy, SAE International, are comfortable calling vehicles with both Level 4 and Level 5 autonomy “fully autonomous,” but from a robotics perspective, the autonomy of the Waymo Driver is a little more nuanced.
While humans may not be directly in the loop with Waymo’s vehicles, there’s a team of them on remote standby to provide high-level guidance if a vehicle finds itself in a novel or ambiguous situation that it isn’t confident about handling on its own. These situations won’t require a human to take over the operation of the vehicle, but they can include things like construction zones, unexpected road closures, or a police officer directing traffic with hand signals— situations a human might be able to interpret at a glance, but that autonomous systems notoriously find difficult.
There’s nothing wrong with the approach of having humans available like this, except that it raises the question of whether a Level 4 autonomous system should really be called fully autonomous and fully independent from a human driver if it sometimes finds itself in situations where it may decide to ask a remote human for guidance. It may seem pedantic, but having a clear understanding of what autonomous systems can and cannot do is very important, especially when such topics are becoming more and more relevant to people who may not have much of a background in robotics or autonomy. This is what prompted Waymo’s tweet, and Waymo now has a whole public education initiative called Let’s Talk Autonomous Driving that’s intended to clearly communicate what autonomous driving is and how it works.
In this same spirit, I spoke with Nathaniel Fairfield, who leads the behavior team at Waymo, to get a more detailed understanding of what Waymo actually means when it calls the Waymo Driver fully autonomous.
IEEE Spectrum: Can you tell us a little bit about your background, and what your current role is at Waymo?
Nathaniel Fairfield: I’m currently a Distinguished Software Engineer at Waymo looking after what we call “behavior,” which is the decision-making part of the onboard software, including behavior prediction, planning, routing, fleet response, and control. I’ve been with the team since we were founded as the Google self-driving car project back in 2009, and my background is in robotics. Before Waymo I was at the Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute (where I received my Ph.D. and Masters) working on robots that could map complex 3D environments (ex: flooded cenotes in Mexico) and before that, I worked at a company called Bluefin Robotics building robots to map the ocean floor. 
How does Waymo define full autonomy?
When we think about defining full autonomy at Waymo, the question is whether the system is designed to independently perform the entire dynamic driving task in all conditions in our operational design domain (ODD) without the need to rely on human intervention, or whether it requires a human to intervene and take control in such situations to keep things safe. The former would be full autonomy, and the latter would not be. The delta between the two is the difference between the L4 system we’re developing at Waymo (the Waymo Driver) which is responsible for executing the entire dynamic driving task, and L2 or L3 systems.
What are the specific operational conditions under which Waymo’s vehicles cannot operate autonomously?
Our current ODD in Phoenix, where we have our fully autonomous service Waymo One, is around 130 km2 (larger than the city of San Francisco). This area is broad enough to cover everyday driving, which includes different roadway types, various maneuvers, speed ranges, all times of day, and so on. Our ODD is always evolving as our technology continues to advance. Just like a competent human driver, the Waymo Driver is designed so that it will not operate outside of its approved ODD. The Waymo Driver is designed to automatically detect weather or road conditions that would affect safe driving within our ODD and return to base or come to a safe stop (i.e. achieve a “minimal risk condition”) until conditions improve.
If Waymo’s vehicles encounter a novel situation, they ask a remote human supervisor for assistance with decision making. Can you explain how that process works?
Imagine you’re out driving and you come up to a “road closed” sign ahead. You may pause for a bit as you look for a “Detour” sign to show you how to get around it or if you don’t see that, start preparing to turn around from that road and create your own detour or new route. The Waymo Driver does the same thing as it evaluates how to plot the best path forward. In a case like this where the road is fully blocked, it can call on our Fleet Response specialists to provide advice on what route might be better or more efficient and then take that input, combine it with the information it has from the onboard map and what it’s seeing in real time via the sensors, and choose the best way to proceed.  This example shows a few basic properties of all our fleet response interactions:
The remote humans are not teleoperating the carsThe Waymo Driver is not asking for help to perceive the surrounding environment; it can already do that. It’s asking for advice on more strategic planning questions based on what it’s already perceived. The Waymo Driver is always responsible for being safeHuman responses can be very helpful, but are not essential for safe driving
What are some examples of situations or decision points where the Waymo Driver may not be able to proceed without input from a human?
In addition to construction, another example would be interpreting hand gestures. While that’s something we’ve improved a lot on over the last few years, it’s a common scenario the Waymo Driver likes to call on Fleet Response for at times. The Waymo Driver can perceive that someone may be using hand signals, such as another road user waving their hands, and then it will call on Fleet Response to confirm what the gesture appears to be signaling and use that input to make a decision about when and how to proceed.
This is completely dynamic and depends on the specific scenario; not “all construction zones” or “all novel situations” will the Waymo Driver engage with Fleet Response. There are some dead ends or construction zones, for example, where the Waymo Driver may not need to call on Fleet Response at all. Those are just examples of some common scenarios we see Fleet Response utilized for—cases where the Waymo Driver may call on Fleet Response, but does not have to.
So the “driving task” is sometimes separate from “strategic planning,” which may include navigating through situations where a human is giving directions through hand signals, busy construction zones, full road closures, and things like that. And remote humans may at times be required to assist the Waymo Driver with strategic planning decisions. Am I understanding this correctly?
Zooming out a bit (this may get a little philosophical): are tasks made up of layers of behaviors of increasing levels of sophistication (so as to be able to cover every eventuality), or is it possible to carve off certain domains where only certain behaviors are necessary, and call that the task? A simplistic example would be tying your shoelaces. Does it include what I do most every day: putting on the shoe, tying the knot? Or does it also include dealing with a nasty knot that my son put in the laces? Or include patching the laces if they break? Or replacing if the break is in a bad place? Or finding new laces if I have to replace the lace? Or going to the store if I need to buy a new lace?
If it’s the first case, even humans aren’t really individually autonomous, because we rely on other individuals for assistance (changing a tire), public works (installing a traffic light), and social decision-making (traffic management of a small-town July-4th parade). If it’s the second case, then there is an endless discussion to be had about exactly where to draw the lines. So in some sense, it’s arbitrary, and we can agree to disagree, but what is the fun of that? I would argue that there are certain “useful” distinctions to draw—where there are certain sets of capabilities that allow an agent to do something meaningful.
And to clarify—this isn’t just Waymo’s perspective, it’s actually how SAE makes these distinctions. SAE essentially defines the dynamic driving task (DDT, or what the Waymo Driver is responsible for) as involving the tactical and operational functions required to operate a vehicle, which are separate from strategic functions.
EDITOR’S NOTE: According to SAE, the dynamic driving task includes the operational (steering, braking, accelerating, monitoring the vehicle and roadway) and tactical (responding to events, determining when to change lanes, turn, use signals, etc.) aspects of the driving task, but not the strategic (determining destinations and waypoints) aspect of the driving task. SAE’s definition of Level 4 autonomy involves the driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene.
What is the disengagement rate for Waymo’s vehicles when they are operating with passengers? What are the most frequent causes of disengagements?
“Disengagement” usually refers to when a vehicle operator in the car switches the mode from autonomous to manual. With our fully autonomous service, we don’t have vehicle operators in the car so there’re technically no “disengagements” the way the term is generally understood. We do have a roadside assistance team who can assist the vehicle (and switch it over to manual control, if appropriate) while on the road but we don’t have metrics to share on those interactions. But, the idea that these disengagement rates should be deducted from autonomy and that anything that ever gets stuck isn’t “fully autonomous” is flawed. Under that definition, human drivers aren’t “fully” autonomous! It would be sort of silly to say that “Nathaniel is 99.999% autonomous because he had to call a tow truck that one time.” 
I agree that it would be silly to say that Nathaniel is only 99.999% autonomous because he had to call a tow truck, but that’s because most people don’t consider that to be part of the driving task—I think it might be less silly to say that Nathaniel is only 99.999% autonomous if he sometimes can’t drive through construction zones or can’t reroute himself if he encounters a road closure.
When you get into a taxi, you don’t ask yourself whether the driver has a particular license to drive on a particular road, or whether you’ll have to jump into the front seat to grab the steering wheel. You just assume that they can get you to your destination without any intervention. When you get in a vehicle driven by the Waymo Driver, you can safely make that assumption! It doesn’t mean that your human taxi driver can’t look for advice in some situations, nor does it mean that the Waymo Driver can’t do the same. 
Additionally, and as noted above, we think the SAE distinctions are helpful in determining what constitutes the dynamic driving task that an L4 automated driving system like the Waymo Driver must be able to perform, including that the DDT does not involve strategic functions. The examples you reference here are either functions the Waymo Driver can perform (such as driving through a clearly marked construction zone) or are examples of where the Waymo Driver receives information or clarification of some facts to facilitate its performance of the DDT. Human drivers (like the taxi driver!) receive information to inform their driving from radio reports, navigation devices, or even from asking adjacent motorists in stopped traffic what they see ahead, and in a confusing situation might ask a traffic officer how to get around a crash area.
So your perspective is that a system can be accurately described as “fully autonomous” if it sometimes relies on a human for strategic decision making?
Yes. the Waymo Driver is a fully autonomous driver in the Phoenix service area, and I think most roboticists would agree with me there! This is because for the purpose of driving our riders to their destinations, the Waymo Driver makes all the decisions related to the dynamic driving task.
What robotics research (besides your own, of course!) are you most excited about right now?
I’ll be honest, our research at Waymo into high-capability decision-making systems that promote safety and interact naturally with humans is about as cool (and challenging) as it gets! It involves reasoning about uncertainty (and our own limitations in sensing and interpretation), reasoning about the intentions of other agents, and how the actions of other agents will change depending on our actions, and using millions of miles of real world driving experience and cutting-edge machine learning to accelerate progress in behavior. I’m also very impressed by both the mechanical engineering and sophisticated footstep planning shown by Boston Dynamics they are doing some really elegant robotics. And a part of my heart belongs to exploration robotics too, be it under water, under ice, or on other planets (or in the case of Europa, all three). It’s the combination of rock-solid mechanisms, robust autonomous capability, and ground-breaking scientific discovery.

The need to have a human somewhere in the loop for strategic edge cases is a very robot-y thing, and perhaps that’s why it’s incorporated into the SAE’s autonomy levels. And technically, Waymo is absolutely correct to call its vehicle fully autonomous based on that definition. I think the risk, though, is that people may not intuitively understand that “full autonomy” only applies to the dynamic driving task, and not the strategic planning task, which (for humans) is an integral part of what we tend to think of as “driving.”
What I’d really like to know is what happens, some number of years from now, after Waymo has solved the strategic planning part of driving (which I’m sure they will). Because at that point, the Waymo Driver will be more autonomous than it was before, and they’ll have to communicate that somehow. Even fuller autonomy? Full autonomy plus? Overfull autonomy? I can’t wait to find out.

The National Transit Database found recently that public transit ridership in the United States plunged 62% in 2020, as COVID-19 took hold. One of the transit sector’s responses, though, has been to embrace health measures like new on-board air filtration systems, face-mask detection systems and, increasingly, contactless payments as a lure to regain those lost passengers.
The National Transit Database, which aggregates data from hundreds of transit agencies nationwide, estimated that 482 million fewer rides were taken in the last year than in 2019, as the pandemic made traveling in enclosed spaces a risky endeavor. Large transit agencies like New Jersey Transit and New York City’s Metropolitan Transit Authority have already experimented with sanitizing trains nightly, installing mask-detection cameras and offering mobile apps that show how crowded railcars are.
But the most popular solution among transit agencies and riders alike has been a growing embrace of contactless payment systems that enable riders to pay fares on their phones rather than using cash or swiping cards.
“The need to keep passengers and staff safe while providing reliable services has never been greater for public transit authorities,” Miroslav Katsarov, the chief executive of contactless payment manufacturer Modeshift, said in a press release. “We’re proud that 20 cities around the world have trusted us to implement contactless fare collection systems on their public transit networks, and we hope that riders feel safer using it.”
Modeshift recently launched its contactless mobile payment app on the local bus lines in Lancaster and Reading, Pennsylvania. The company’s software enables users to scan into public transit through a unique QR code generated on the app once they purchase their fare.
At least 12 of the 37 grants distributed last month by the Federal Transit Administration will be used by transit agencies to procure contactless payment systems like Modeshift’s. The South Central Transit Authority, which operates the bus systems in Lancaster and Reading, has seen improved ridership in the two months since it started taking mobile payments, said Dave Kilmer, the agency’s executive director.
“Since the start of the pandemic, we’ve seen a large decline in the number of public transit users across Berks and Lancaster counties.” Kilmer said in the Modeshift press release. “Since implementing Modeshift’s contactless fare collection system we’ve seen the adoption rate increase week over week, and now, 99% of our public transit users have migrated to the new system and prefer contactless payments for fares.”

The market size for autonomous last-mile delivery is intensifying day by day and is expected to grow to almost 85 U.S. billion dollars by 2030. The demand for autonomous last-mile delivery occurred at an even faster pace than we expected back in 2016. For example, autonomous robots and drones were conceptual in 2016, and now, we see the large-scale deployment of robotics and drones in last-mile deliveries. 
The last-mile delivery process is coined as the most integral part of present-day shipping companies. Today logistic companies’ are not only focusing on shipments from the transport hub, but they are also testing a series of technology solutions at every stage of last-mile delivery.  This kind of extensive growth makes the last-mile carrier a strength for all retail companies, not a setback. The goal will be to deploy technology solutions that could minimize the delivery time, ensure transparency, and minimize cost with smart vehicles for last-mile operations.
The New Generation of Last-Mile Delivery
As a share of operational shipping costs, the last-mile delivery costs are substantial and 53% overall. New technologies, software, and tools, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, can quickly identify inefficiencies in the last-mile algorithms. In this post, you’ll see how AI can be applied in practical situations to minimize problems in last-mile delivery. The new generation of AI will give retailers the ability to optimize their last-mile carrier, leading to the simplification of processes and performance.
To survive the market competition, supply chain enterprises are only left with the option of optimizing last-mile delivery with technology solutions, including AI and machine learning. Successful last-mile strategy pillars are determined by speed, accuracy, efficiency, transparency, and, most importantly, a positive customer experience. Covid-19 and lockdown have changed the usual shopping ways and added more pressure on supply chain companies to ensure faster and more quick last-mile deliveries for customers.    
Technology trends, especially AI in the last-mile, stood out during this disruptive phase of the pandemic. Whether big or small, supply chain enterprises must implement AI technology for improved last-mile operations in the future. We’ve all heard of stories of deliveries not showing up on time. This puts pressure on logistics companies to make it right. In this line, NextBillion AI, an industry-leading startup, recently announces custom map API solutions for telematics and last-mile logistics. The global geocode API solutions handle factors such as inconsistency in managing hours of operations, drive-pattern, and drive-time by using the advanced ML algorithm. 
Let’s speak about the Amazon delivery that has begun using AI-equipped cameras across its delivery fleets. This allowed Amazon to scale up their last-mile deliveries as cameras are equipped with artificial intelligence software capable of detecting 16 different safety issues, including distracted driving, hard braking, and whether the driver is not wearing a seatbelt.
A Constantly Changed Landscape of AI in Last-Mile
Smarter ways of last-mile delivery are coming up. Implementation of AI in last-mile logistics is gaining momentum. In the coming years, there will be increased adoption of artificial intelligence for improved last-mile fulfillment. Smart tech optimizes not-mile operations and reduces human dependency that can fetch great business results in the long run. Today, enterprises consider investing in Artificial Intelligence to optimize their last-mile operations. Here is how it works.
Artificial Intelligence processes machines and software systems using human intelligence. AI has changed the ways businesses handle their logistics. This technology has the maximum impact on a company’s last-mile operations and, in the process, optimizes issues such as routing, visibility, allocation of resources, and parcel sorting. Here we will see how AI in the last-mile delivery can help logistics companies make significant optimization to compete effectively.
AI Led Geocoding
The complexity of the supply chain process increases with the number of drop locations. As the shipping volume increases, the last-mile deliveries can get complicated when distributions to be done in remote areas. The customers also write unclear addresses. Location is crucial to logistics companies and service providers looking to tailor the final steps of last-mile delivery to their customers. With Artificial Intelligence and algorithms-led geocoding, even the unclear of addresses can be converted into precise locations on a map. Accurate AI-enabled geocoding helps delivery companies to reach customer destinations faster, which leads to a higher delivery rate.
Geocoding helps to maintain accurate address information to improve accuracy in the final steps of delivery to customers in the digital age. On the other hand, inaccurate data can result in late or no deliveries and poor communication with customers.
Geocoding provides you not only precise location data but also enables the validation of pickup and delivery addresses. Geofencing is another critical component of a delivery network that ensures real-time pickup and delivery notification, reducing wait time for drivers and lowering shippers’ costs. Ingeocoding, AI aims to find and gather insights to build the best possible geospatial data by detecting patterns, outliers, and trends and understanding the distribution of data across cities, states, or countries.
The second thing is to get the data on a map. The technology helps create a map with a location that can be the center point of your data. Users can add the points to the map. With these technological features, we can make critical decisions to gather data insights.
Using AI in Geocoding, businesses can identify segmentation patterns and plot points on a map more effectively. Also, it is useful in fraud prevention by identifying unusual activity on a customer location. 
AI-Backed Route Planning & Optimization
Thanks to Artificial Intelligence, route planning, and optimization are simpler and more useful than ever. AI route planning facilitates on-time deliveries even when companies deal with a high volume of packages and heavy traffic congestion. Route optimization is one of the most important advancements within logistics technology, coupled with continued improvements in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. The ability to automatically plan optimal last-mile delivery routes is significantly improving than ever before. 
As the eCommerce supply chain and logistics industry experienced the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic, those involved in the business realized the importance of planning and preparing better for the future. Traditionally eCommerce companies relied on zip codes for the last-mile delivery of shipments. But today, companies started creating their zones or warehouses for last-mile deliveries. However, for delivery during the festive season, hefty volumes throw off the company’s zones. This is why companies search for route optimization software that guarantees optimal delivery routes and automated recommendations for the best-suited vehicle based on the volume of shipment, delivery requirements, geographical conditions, and shipment type.
One central area of AI in route planning and optimization is creating plans and routes according to driver requirements. With Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, logistics companies can plan routes based on the driver’s performance and multiple variables. This technology trend will set companies to ensure faster last-mile delivery by utilizing real-time data and historical patterns for planning and optimization. This saves time, and more importantly, less time spend on route planning and optimization means less expenditure, fewer drivers paid hours, and less demand for delivery vehicles.      
AI to Gain Last-Mile Visibility 
Last-Mile visibility is the ability to track products during transit. Today, 93% of consumers want to stay more informed about their products’ location throughout the delivery process. This puts pressure on organizations to gain last-mile visibility from in-transit status to final delivery of products. Last-mile visibility is backed by AI and machine learning that allows for tracking and tracing parcels in real-time and identify issues in the process, thereby allowing companies to take proactive action to prevent customer pain.
According to a survey by Capgemini, 83% of shippers believe that last-mile visibility is a crucial factor for growth. The technology-backed solution for fleet tracking offers multiple checkpoints for tracking a package when it is received or transferred to its final destination. Customers will be alerted with emails and notifications that provide visibility throughout the delivery stages in real-time. For example, FedEx uses a tracking tool, InSight, that utilizes reference numbers for tracking orders. Amazon delivers a MapTracker to guide a delivery driver about the dropoff destination. Amazon Locker is a tool that alerts customers via text messages and emails when their package is dropped off at their residence or any other location for pickup. 
As AI continues turning businesses around, it has been proven that companies have nothing to fear for unpredictability in tackling routes, weather, and address related issues. As the market moves toward a more automated future, retailers will need to tackle these challenges with technology-backed solutions to work toward perfecting their last-mile delivery, which can further refine their last-mile visibility and transparency. If done well, this results in improved accuracy and profits and proves to be a competitive advantage for any organization.
Conclusion: Think Outside the Box
The future of your eCommerce business is in your hands now. To stay competitive, retailers will need to invest in AI-backed last-mile strategies. Several useful AI and ML applications exist in today’s landscape that aid a shipping company to ensure that deliveries are completed with full transparency and visibility. So, think out of the box with AI and machine learning that simplifies human efforts in the last-mile logistics operations and ultimately paves the way for businesses.

A recent study of roughly two-thirds of the country’s traffic signals revealed that Americans spend about 17.25 million hours waiting for poorly timed signals every day.
The study, published this month by the transportation data company Inrix, tracked the movements of thousands of connected vehicles every five seconds as they moved through roughly 210,000 intersections nationwide. Researchers found that nearly 7% of any car ride was spent waiting at traffic crossings and intersections.
Researchers also tracked certain regions, including Los Angeles County, which topped the study with a total of more than one million daily delay hours, and Brooklyn, New York, which averaged the longest delay per vehicle at 23.5 seconds.
The report concluded that poor signal timing was responsible for roughly 10% of total traffic delay time, double the figure commonly cited by a 2004 report from the Federal Highway Administration.
“Emerging research is concluding that this number is likely much higher, with findings from two states estimating roughly 25% of total delay attributed to signals,” Inrix’s report said. “Our direct measurements of individual vehicles interacting with individual intersections is consistent with this emerging research.”
Regardless of the exact percentage, cities have taken action over the past several years to reduce congestion on their roadways, to reduce emissions and improve quality-of-life for commuting residents.
The FHWA recently funded 10 regional programs, with participation from state and local government and universities, to pilot new technologies built around planning more efficient traffic systems. Inrix itself signed deals last year with several states, including Louisiana, Oregon and Tennessee, to collect more data about traffic congestion.

At the moment there is much speculation and uncertainty about what America’s major metropolitan regions will look like. As the nation finally emerges from its current public health crisis and the economic hardships that have resulted from the responses to it, questions abound about the future of work, place, and transportation.
One thing is clear: the future of the nation’s major cities is interwoven with the transportation systems that serve them. This is particularly true for the transit networks and providers that make the economies of dense central business districts (CBD) possible As Harvard economist Edward Glaeser has noted, transportation technologies have shaped cities.
In the last 20 or 30 years America’s major metropolitan regions—and their CBDs—have become the engines of the nation’s economic growth. These urban centers are characterized by technological innovation, diversity, and knowledge-based financial and professional services. They are generally the locations of leading health, educational, and cultural institutions.
 In 2018, more than half of the U.S. population lived in metropolitan regions of over one million, and just the ten largest have a combined economic output great than every other country on the planet, except China, according to the U.S. Conference of Mayors. The Economist recently noted that workers who live in the nation’s largest metropolitan regions are 50 percent more productive than those who live in smaller metros.
Moreover, the existence of reliable transportation services that provide mobility and accessibility to CBDs have been perquisites for, and closely related to, the transformation of these urban areas and their economic growth and significance. Nicole Gelinas of the Manhattan Institute wrote recently, “Subways, buses and commuter rail make up the physical infrastructure that enables urban life. . . . A big part of what makes cities attractive is street life, which is incompatible with suburban-style car dependency.”
Eight months into the pandemic, the white-collar workforce of major metro CBDs are only a fraction of pre-COVID-19 levels and, importantly, the restaurants, hotels, and retail stores that serve them are operating at much reduced levels. Many have been forced to close permanently. Theaters and other downtown cultural and recreational venues are similarly closed.
Not surprisingly, the transit systems that serve city centers are under severe financial strain in the face of precipitous ridership and revenue declines. The challenge is that CBDs cannot survive without transit, and transit systems cannot survive without riders, unless there are massive and continuing operating subsidies from the general funds of cities or states, themselves facing daunting deficits, or from the federal government.
There are those who believe that major cities will bounce back once there is a vaccine and/or effective treatments for COVID-19, as New York City did after 9/11. However, this time seems different, perhaps because the public health and related economic crises revealed several key trends already in place:
For one, the pandemic has dramatically demonstrated the wide economic inequalities within the nation’s major metropolitan regions and the social isolation of many lower-income communities. Prosperity, opportunity, and access that seem to characterize these urbanized regions are not equitably shared.
We also learned that much office work can be accomplished remotely, especially if you are white and college-educated. Telecommuting and working from home was growing before the pandemic, and many firms have learned through this experience that their need for downtown office space can be reduced, perhaps sharply. This suggests that hotel, restaurant, and retail uses that serve downtown office workers may be overbuilt.
Similarly, escalating costs and limited supplies of housing in urban and close-in suburban areas of major metropolitan regions has already led to the outmigration of people. In places like Boston, New York, Seattle, and San Francisco this means those who cannot, or are unable to work from home, are seeing longer and longer home to work commutes.
And the decline in brick-and-mortar retail and the growth of online shopping has greatly accelerated by the pandemic. In fact, e-tail shopping is so strong, it will more than make up for the drop in traditional business that has a physical store.
All of these land use and economic trends, if maintained, will have significant implications for transportation services (not limited to transit) and should influence transportation capital planning, design, and investment decision-making.
Overall, America’s major or “star” metropolitan regions are likely to remain the drivers of the nation’s economic and population growth and centers of innovation and diversity in a post-pandemic world. However, these major metropolitan regions and the various activities and land uses within them are likely to become more decentralized.  That means that metropolitan transportation services and facilities will have to provide the mobility, access, and opportunity in different ways.
Transit services are going to have to become more innovative, flexible, and customer-driven, even as reduced ridership and/or new practices will demand continuing and significant public operating subsidies. Effective, reliable, and available transit must become an essential element in overcoming inequality and isolation for disadvantaged communities and residents of metropolitan regions. To enable those reforms and to enhance service, greater cooperation between the public and private sectors will be required.
Finally, more decentralized metropolitan regions and more remote office uses (whether through greater work-at-home or satellite offices in less dense areas) and concerns about health safety on public transit and commuter rail could well mean an increase in auto-mobility within metropolitan regions. If so, we must be certain that greater use of motor vehicles (including trucking, related to changes in retail and more home deliveries) cannot translate into increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector. A mix of fuel efficiency and emissions regulation and pricing (whether mileage-based fees or carbon taxes) must accompany these changes in metropolitan economies and land uses.
Just as we cannot predict the post-pandemic future of office and related commercial uses, we cannot be certain of the nature of the transportation demands and facilities that will be necessary to enable and support those economic and social changes, and the altered urban growth patterns that are likely to emerge. However, innovation and flexibility will have to be essential characteristics of transportation planners, engineers, and executives, as the nation emerges from its public health and economic crises.

It remains to be seen whether the global pandemic and the shift to remote work have permanently slammed the brakes on morning and evening rush hours. If the daily commute ever returns, one innovation made possible by vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology could be the rise of the smart intersection.
Smart traffic management systems are projected to save cities a whopping $277 billion over the next four years by reducing emissions and traffic congestion, according to U.K.-based Juniper Research.
Smart intersection and related technologies are expected to reduce time stuck in traffic by 33 hours per year per motorist by 2025 — a 64 percent improvement in traffic flow and potential road rage.
Along with V2X, smart intersection technologies will leverage 5G interconnectivity along with AI-based automation. Unlike current sensor-based systems, that combination will help manage traffic flows using real-time data.
Those innovations are expected to eventually replace traffic sensors — including inductive-loop detectors embedded in pavement along with infrared and microwave sensors and video cameras. All have largely proven ineffective in reducing those long lines of brake lights.
The market researcher reckons more than 95 percent of the projected $277 billion in savings (rising from $178 billion this year) will be directly attributable to reduced traffic congestion. The European and North American markets are expected to accounted for 75 percent of those savings during the forecast period.
The wild card could be the booming Chinese market, which has rebounded much faster from the pandemic than western countries. Beijing’s series of ring roads, for example, are notorious rush-hour parking lots, and are therefore a prime candidate for advanced traffic management systems.
Attempts at adding lane capacity tend to result in simply adding more vehicles while doing little to relieve congestion. Hence, market trackers argue that smart traffic infrastructure like V2X is a more cost-effective approach than wider roads. By collecting and disseminating data on what’s up the road, “V2X connectivity will enable smart traffic management platforms to gather data directly from vehicles, rather than relying on traditional traffic actuation methods,” Juniper Research concludes.
Unclogging city streets also will require collaboration among automakers and the V2X system providers on other emerging services like smart parking. Investments in technologies designed to help drivers find a parking space are expected to jump from $460 million this year to $1 billion by 2025.
Those investments include displays that provide real-time data on available city parking along with connectivity between parking sensors, management platforms and harried commuters.
Something to think while waiting for those interminable series of red lights to change.

The German government is drafting legislation to permit the use of Level Four autonomous driving technology on public roads, according to the country’s Minister for Transport and Digital Infrastructure Andreas Scheuer.
As laid out in our guide to self-driving cars, Level Four autonomy denotes the capability to safely navigate almost any on-road circumstance without the need for any driver intervention.
In an official statement posted online, Minister Scheuer said: “Germany will be the first country in the world to bring autonomous vehicles from its research laboratories onto the road.
“I am very pleased that the cabinet has cleared the way for our law on autonomous driving … The German government aims to bring the laws into regular operation by 2022, meaning that within 12 months there could be driverless cars operating,” he added.
However, such technology – at least initially – will reportedly be restricted to certain vehicles travelling in predetermined “zones.”
Toby Walsh, Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of New South Wales, told CarAdvice the decision is not without risk, but ultimately represents a step in the right direction. 
“Driving itself is already a very dangerous activity – people die on the roads every single day but eventually, because of autonomous cars, that hopefully won’t happen as much. We just need to find the best and safest way to roll out the technology, and the Germans – being German – have been very pragmatic about it.”
As for the future of the technology in Australia, Mr Walsh wasn’t holding his breath: “Just like with electric cars, we’re way behind the curve here.”
“Personally, I can’t wait for them to arrive. I hate driving, I think it’s a waste of time, and it’s dangerous,” he added.

The fleet industry is experiencing heavy disruption at the hands of technology. All the processes are now going digital, and AI is taking over every segment that involves decision making. 
There’s no doubt that businesses that fail to open up to the changing trends won’t survive the competition because fleet companies with digital processes are already spending less capital, efforts, and time.
Several trends are fast changing the landscape of the fleet industry. If you own a fleet or run a business with its own fleet of vehicles, you have to stay abreast of thetrucking industry updates.
Here are the top trends that are shaping the future of fleet management. 
Ideas That Are Changing The Trucking Industry
1. Telematics And Tracking
Telematics and fleet tracking are redefining how fleet companies executed their assignments. They are not new but will continue to be one of the top trends in the fleet industry. 
Telematics and tracking have helped fleet managers keep an eye on their drivers’ working hours through ELDs. Plus, driver behavior can be monitored via telematics to ensure fleet operators are protected on the road.
Telematics has also been crucial in providing data for inventory and maintenance schedules.
It is expected that more technology will be added to the folds to provide more information than ever before. In the future, telematics and tracking will provide more efficient and precise execution. 
The latest technology will pin-point real-time locations along with the ability to share information with others. These functions will help fleet managers make dynamic changes to routes and pick-up points.  
2. Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning
Since technology grows by the day, you must stay up-to-date with trends such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). 
These innovations in technology have substantially impacted the logistics industry. The fleet domain produces a lot of data needed to reveal trends and identify links, handled very well by AI. 
AI and ML can handle workforce planning, supplier selection, route analysis, warehouse management, and so much more. It has effectively reduced human intervention by taking up decision making in crucial functions. 
AI and ML are expected to further revolutionize the processes by eliminating human-made mistakes and empower companies to avert any bad practices in the workflow. 
Both AI and ML are state-of-the-art technology tools designed to bring visible results and help logistics businesses tackle the most difficult of issues. 
3. IoT
IoT or Internet of Things has disrupted several industries, including logistics. 
This industry required proper co-ordination and effectiveness, and IoT stepped right in the middle of the chaos to offer the best connectivity and internet. 
The arrival of IoT in logistics has resulted in smooth data exchange between multiple elements and teams of a business. This improved flow has further facilitated efficient control of critical assets. 
Fleet managers can now predict risks, check the condition of goods while in transit, forecast traffic congestion, assure proper cargo handling, manage teams, and do more remotely. 
IoT in logistics is here to stay and will significantly shape the sector’s future. It is going to be the backbone of smarter and more predictive fleet management solutions. 
Supporters of IoT expect that the trend will result in huge savings for the industry and substantially reduce emissions produced by the transportation and logistics industry. 
4. Blockchain
Blockchain is often associated only with cryptocurrency, but the truth is, it can do so much more than what we know. It can, in essence, boost the sustainability of the operations that influence the fleet sector.
The logistics industry has been taking advantage of blockchain via decentralized ledgers that improve transparency for customers and let them track the whole journey of their product until it arrives at their door. 
The supply chain sector is in dire need of increasing trust levels, and blockchain can effectively help by further securing digital payments. 
Blockchain can also play a crucial part in the logistics industry with the help of smart contracts. A smart contract enables logistics companies to automate the buying process, minimize red tape, and increase transparency. 
Blockchain is in its initial phases, but it is sure to progress fast and become one of the most popular trends at the core of the transport industry. 
5. Computer Vision
Computer Vision (CV) is a technology that enables computers to identify images and videos. This technology is new to the industry and has found its place in delivery, accident management, and warehouse automation. 
It can handle multiple tasks like barcode reading, warehouse territory monitoring, employee tracking, etc. and be useful in theft prevention and avoiding safety violations. 
Computer vision may take some more time to be fully accepted in the industry, but once its benefits are recognized, this trend will be one of the driving forces of the transport industry. 
6. Fleet Management Programs
Fleet management programs or transport management systems are software tools that bring all the technology used in a fleet business on a single platform. 
This program is where you will find all the data collected by the technology and tools to process them. The trend is useful for implementing new fleet strategies for optimum efficiency.
Transport management is already being used for route optimization, carrier management, digital record management, and more. But the program is constantly evolving to add new functions. 
Suffice it to say that these systems are here to stay and will soon be adopted by both small and big fleet and logistics companies. 
Conclusion
All the trends in the transport industry, right from the well-knowngps definitionto the latest computer vision, are meant to improve processes and simplify transactions.
The trends mentioned above are fast changing the industry with their capabilities and enabling businesses to provide their employees with a safe transit that they deserve.
Fleet managers and fleet businesses can now invest in technology and achieve complicated tasks like accident management, warehouse management, and route planning without human intervention. 
The best part is, all the tech and gadgets can be customized to scale, and every company, no matter its size, can take advantage of the up and coming trends in the industry.

As interest in electric buses in Australia grows – despite the best efforts of the federal government to act like an Emu and bury its head in the sand – it’s worth looking at what is happening overseas, and China in particular.
The EV video website “Fully Charged” has recently produced this episode. Fully Charged: Electric buses in Shenzen.  And despite the less than fully professional presentation, the access granted was so good that inevitably some useful information slipped through the cracks.
The first thing that struck me was the use of English in the wall-length computer dashboard.
So for facts and figures there are, for instance, 16,000 electric buses in Shenzen and the franchise the reporter visited had 6,000, of which 5,938 were in operation at that point in time with 181 depots and 2,000 chargers.
Those 6,000 buses do a total of more than 1 million kilometres per day or, say, 180km each. Buses are recharged from 50% capacity using 150KWh chargers.
The bus has a 250-330KWh battery and the recharging depots are integrated to provide restaurants, etc, while the bus recharges.
The depot’s network essentially had to be rebuilt from scratch to optimise for electric. Daily energy consumption by the bus network appears to be .95GWh You can also get that number by using 93kWh/100 km and 1 million km a day, for the fleet. 93KWh/100km compares with, say, 15-19 for electric cars.
For this fleet, alone, that’s 0.35TWh per year. I believe the terrain in Shenzen to reasonably flat and I read a couple of years back that BYD buses had struggled in San Francisco.
For this franchise it was basically a 10-year program to move to fully electric buses and taxis.
Taxi depots were organised similarly. Taxis in this franchise do a cumulative 0.5 million kilometres per day.
So working off, say, 19kWh per 100km, that’s another 35GWh per year. On these numbers, electric vehicles in Shenzen appear already to be consuming a meaningful share of total electricity in China.
Electric vehicles increase thermal energy consumption in China today
I dislike visiting this old and essentially misleading chestnut, but so long as China has 70% of its power coming from thermal generation, then for that long electrification of transport and industrial processes will increase thermal electricity consumption.
Of course as we, the citizens of the world, decarbonise electricity supply, so it is that electric vehicles make a net positive contribution.
The point is, the two have to go hand in hand. And that brings us to:
China’s electricity consumption is growing
So is coal consumption. Wind and solar are growing quickly but are still at less than half the level as a share of total supply. The numbers below are calendar years.
Figure 2 Source: National Bureau of Statistics, CAGR = Cumulative average growth rate
You can slice and dice these numbers in a few ways.
If you want to be an optimist I suppose you could say that of the increase in electricity production between 2015 and 2020 only 2/3 is from thermal.
However at 1525TWh, the increase alone is equal to, say, 7.5X Australian total consumption from all sources and so it’s a lot of coal, arguably more than China can produce from its own resources.
Shenzen electric transport is already at around 1TWh per year
Shenzen has electrified its public transport. The next step will be to electrify other government-owned transport (garbage services, police, construction machinery and so on). In the process, it’s increased regional electricity consumption by about 1TWh per year, modest in the bigger scheme of things.
Shenzen sets a fine example for Australia
In a capitalist, market-based economy, government policy shouldn’t matter so much. The fact is that Australia has excellent opportunities in electric vehicles; opportunities to increase energy security by reducing oil dependency,opportunities to develop 21st century industries like battery and car technology, opportunities to reduce carbon emissions, opportunities to create a better lifestyle for Australians, opportunities to shift from one form of resource extraction, coal, to another, lithium, and to enhance our world position in rare earths, copper, aluminium and nickel.
The Shenzen example shows that strong public commitment is required to manage transition of bus and taxi fleets. The system needs to be planned, depots reconfigured, shifts reorganised, and a comprehensive charging network established with an eye to future technology.
In regard to all of this, Australia’s federal government leadership is completely lacking. “Have a go” seems to belong to another era.
Federal cabinet is comprised of people with good academic credentials, including Angus Taylor, but their ability seems to be used for anything but the good of Australia’s people, present and future. That only serves to reinforce the increasing cynicism people have towards leaders who waste their own and everyone else’s time.
Burying your head in the sand is an Australian metaphor. Rarely has it seemed more apt.

 Optimising the transport system in terms of traffic flow, commutability and safety in these tightly-packed spaces have become a key concern for the public and private sectors – with climate change also prompting an urgent rethink of urban transportation. So, what will the future of urban mobility look like? 
Bosch notes that, by the end of 2020, around 70% of the global population will dwell in cities. These urban environments, which are already bursting at the seams, will struggle to operate as the number of people entering them increases. Here are five of the key trends, which we anticipate will shape the future of urban mobility. The future of urban mobility: key trends for 2021
Autonomous vehicles
Speaking about the future of urban mobility, autonomous vehicles are among the first trends to come to one’s mind. The driverless vehicle, or AV, market is currently valued at approximately $54 billion. That’s set to increase tenfold within the next decade, as technologies that enable automated car manufacture become more sophisticated and readily available.
Currently, there are around 1,500 self-driving cars on the road in the US but, with big automakers including Toyota, Honda, BMW and Renault ploughing investment into driverless functionality, the market is set to boom. German automotive behemoth, Audi, has plans to invest around $16 billion in its autonomous vehicles by 2030.
There are five levels of automation, from level 1, which offers some of the driver assist functionality we already see on the roads, to 5 which will, eventually, offer a fully autonomous “robot vehicle” – taking complete control of the driver’s seat. The levels breakdown as follows:
Level 1: Driver assistance – the vehicle is controlled by the driver but offers some driver-assist functionality.Level 2: Partial automation – the vehicle requires the driver to remain engaged behind the wheel but offers some combined automated functions, including acceleration and steering.Level 3: Conditional automation – the vehicle is able to monitor the environment but the driver must be ready to take control in a split second.Level 4: High automation – the vehicle can perform all driver functions, depending on certain conditions, and the driver has the option to take over.Level 5: Full automation – the vehicle can perform all driver functions in every type of environment/condition, but the driver has the option to take charge of the wheel if they wish.
Some of the key benefits of driverless technology include:
Reduction in accidents – According to the United States Department of Transportation, human error accounts for 94% of road traffic accidents. By eliminating human error, billions of dollars worth of accident and fatality payments could be saved, productivity within the workplace increased and the social burden of living with injury/coping with loss, eased.Smoother traffic flow through congested areas – autonomous vehicles can facilitate better road cooperation in heavy traffic, allowing drivers to save hours spent in traffic jams and, thus, spend more time at home with their families.Enabling social independence – millions of people across the globe live either physically isolated or isolated by a disability and, in many cases, the key to them living independently is the ability to drive. With vehicle autonomy, many millions more will have access to employment and social interaction which may have otherwise been denied them.
E-mobility
The climate crisis has highlighted the poor and, in some cases, illegal air quality in many of the world’s large cities. Today, there are around 500 “megacities” – some with over 20 million inhabitants consuming around 70% of the world’s energy resources. The rail, subway and road networks servicing these metropolises are no longer adequate to support their expanding populations. According to a study by the UK’s Office of National Statistics, around a fifth of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions came from road transport in 2017 – up 6% since 1990. So the problem needs to be tackled at household level.
Modern internal-combustion engines have come a long way since their first iterations. They are far less polluting but don’t offer a complete solution for better air quality. Vehicle electrification, however, does.
In the Netherlands and, particularly, Amsterdam, inhabitants are experiencing better air quality due to the rapid installation of e-car infrastructure, to support an urban transition to electric transportation. The city has gone so far as to build individual e-car charge points, in instances where e-vehicle owners don’t have their own readily equipped parking spot. And across the Netherlands, Statista recorded almost 41,000 electric charge points for vehicles, as of 2019.
In China, there are currently around 330,000 charge points for electric vehicles and growing, with the country now producing almost 60% of the world’s “new energy vehicles”. Electromobility is no longer a fringe technology. It will fundamentally alter urban mobility in the near future.
Mobility as a Service
Our urban landscapes no longer favour the pedestrian, they’ve been carved up by major road routes and congested with lanes of pollution-emitting traffic. The leaders of the world’s major cities want to see their streets repurposed to support a better quality of life and cleaner air – where previously gridlocked streets could be pedestrianised and turned into much-needed living space, equipped with bike lanes, shops, restaurants and parks.
This has sparked an upsurge in innovative businesses investing in Mobility as a Service (MaaS). This includes bike and car-share schemes, taxi services and vehicle rental, offering a consumer-centric approach to urban mobility. MaaS is an on-demand plaform which uses Big Data and open-source data to offer a real-time consolidated view of different transport options, as well as simplified route planning and payment. 
Sweden’s UbiGo launched in 2019, pioneering an app which shows all public transport, car-share, taxi and car rental services available to the user, then offers them a mobility subscription service to pay for their journeys. The model was so successful in Stockholm that it has now been rolled out in Gothenburg.
By simplifying the method of finding and paying for transportation on-demand, using big data and two-way communication while continually seeking and implementing user feedback, MaaS solutions could replace individual car ownership for those living in cities.
Micromobility
Reinforcing the lean toward MaaS solutions to free-up valuable street space, a plethora of innovative companies are developing personal mobility devices and light electric vehicles for the masses, which take up far less square-footage than traditional motor vehicles. Technological advances have allowed manufacturers to shrink electric motors and compact their batteries to develop e-scooters and EVs which tackle the double threat of pollution and congestion.
In San Fransisco in 2018, startup company Bird deployed a fleet of electric scooters onto city streets, with unprecedented uptake. Fast-forward to 2020 and, according to a report by Europe’s MotorCycles Data, the electric two-wheeler market has leapt by 11% in the first nine months of this year. Sales of e-scooters hit 75,000 across 28 continental countries (including the UK), jumping by a straggering 36.6% in the third quarter of the year.
Demand has been boosted by COVID-19, which has deterred many people from using public transport to get from A to B. Now, it seems that personal mobility devices are here to stay, with the public sector needing to come up with robust policies on where they can/should be ridden and where to store them safely when not in use.
And, where individuals need a mobility option that allows them to carry more than just themselves, light electric vehicles offer a compact footprint for ideal use in urban environments, while still offering the functionality of a car.
Shared mobility
We’ve briefly touched on vehicle sharing already, but shared mobility across all modes – carsharing, ride-hailing scooter or bike-sharing services – could dramatically improve our urban landscapes and air quality. There has been a huge increase in companies offering these kinds of services in recent years – Uber, Drive Now, Zipcar, etc. – made easier by the proliferation of data.
Now, big OEM players including Toyota, General Motors, Daimler AG and BMW Group have launched their own carsharing services. And the offering is becoming increasingly flexible too, with companies providing various options including round-trip and free-floating services, with evermore complex pricing plans.
Shared mobility services, implemented as a city-wide framework, can provide people with convenient, door-to-door transportation for a price that’s comparable to public transport, while negating the need for individual car ownership. This, in turn, creates more space for public facilities, leads to better air quality and reduces the burden on natural resources.
Conclusion
As we grapple with the unstoppable growth of our cities and the climatic and social implications of such spaces, innovative businesses must collaborate with the public sector in order to reimagine the future of urban mobility. The wealth of Big and open-source data available now can provide flexible public and private transport solutions that reduce the need for standard, pollution-emitting personal vehicles and outdated, difficult/expensive to maintain rail and subway networks.
There is no one-size-fits-all model, however. Each city must really evaluate its current state vs what its residents need, in order to come up with the urban mobility solution that best fits its population.

AS more Malaysians live in urban areas, cities are starting to face pain points such as congestion, pollution and inefficient deployment of urban services.
Building smart cities is seen as a solution that addresses these issues and improves the quality of life of urban dwellers.
In September last year, then Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad launched Malaysia Smart City Framework. He said it is important to turn Malaysia into a “smart city” and it is among the items of priority under the 12th Malaysia Plan (12th MP).
Arkitek Mustapha Kamal Sdn Bhd principal Mustapha Kamal Zulkarnain says it is a great effort and a good paper (framework) prepared.
“I would certainly hope that the full acronym of SMART (which stands for System, Monitor, Analysis, Reconfigure and Thinking (re-think)) is being implemented and used in our cities to be more meaningful. It should not be just lip service,” he tells FocusM.
Smart city initiatives are also part of the actions of the National Physical Plan 3 which is aimed at expanding and enhancing digital infrastructure, strengthening and expanding broadband coverage, and strengthening the provision of infrastructure facilities and services for smart city initiatives.
Internet of Things (IoT) firm Senzo Malaysia Sdn Bhd chief technology officer Dr Muhammad Imran Sarwar tells FocusM that Kuala Lumpur, Johor and Penang are on the path of becoming smart cities, but they still have a long way to go.
“The smart city initiative should have focused on sustainable energy management, security, autonomous vehicles and public safety.
“From a technological perspective, the launch of 5G will enable smart cities along with IoT, big data analytics and cybersecurity,” he said.
However, slow economic growth in the region, cost of infrastructure and old mindsets are the hurdles of making a smart city, says Muhammad Imran.
“The government should be a bridge between the industry and academia and make smart cities an important agenda for a sustainable tomorrow.”
Smart cities need strategic planning
In planning for smart cities, Mustapha says governments and developers need to understand the preliminary objective of how to implement smart cities and how they can solve the problems in the cities.
“Yes, it would help to boost the government agenda. It should transcend to Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Cyberjaya as they are part of the Multimedia Super Corridor in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
“We have all the ingredients like manpower, knowledgeable technologists, a learning scientific community, and governance from the government,” Mustapha says.
According to him, what is lacking is the belief, trust and commitment by the financial communities to realise the importance of this in order to be at the forefront of economics and technology in the very near future.
“The belief, trust and importance placed by the financial community are to support all these initiatives to fruition. Another is the short-term thinking of this being a long gestation period to return your investments.
“With such participation, we can collectively imagine, examine, choose and shape the future of our cities,” he says.
Mustapha further adds that a smart city is a convergence of big data, connectivity and artificial intelligence (AI) towards a “precision city”.
Meanwhile, Muhammad Imran says the government’s role is to create the policy and framework for a smart city. Moreover, it should encourage different relevant ministries to work together.
“Government should also give tax incentives and research and development funds to the industry and academia so they can develop all the components of a smart city locally.”
Why we need smart cities
Mustapha shares the primary goal of a smart city is to create an urban environment that yields a high quality of life to its residents while also generating overall economic growth.
“Therefore, a major advantage of smart cities is their ability to facilitate an increased delivery of services to citizens with less infrastructure and cost.
“As the population within cities continues to grow, it becomes necessary for these urban areas to accommodate the increasing population by making more efficient use of their infrastructure and assets,” he says.
Smart city applications can enable these improvements, advance city operations and improve the quality of life among residents as well as find and create new value from their existing infrastructure.
Smart city technology
Smart cities use a combination of IoT devices, software solutions, user interfaces (UI) and communication networks.
However, they rely first and foremost on the IoT. The IoT is a network of connected devices – such as vehicles, sensors or home appliances – that can communicate and exchange data.
Data collected and delivered by the IoT sensors and devices are stored in the cloud or on servers.
The connection of these devices and use of data analytics facilitate the convergence of the physical and digital city elements, thus improving both public and private sectors’ efficiency, enabling economic benefits and improving citizens’ lives.
The IoT devices sometimes have processing capabilities called edge computing. Edge computing ensures that only the most important and relevant information is communicated over the communication network.
Features of a smart city
Mustapha notes that emerging trends such as automation, machine learning and the IoT are driving smart city adoption.
Theoretically, any area of city management can be incorporated into a smart city initiative, he says. A classic example is the smart parking meter that uses an application to help drivers find available parking spaces without prolonged circling of crowded city blocks.
The smart meter also enables digital payment, so there’s no risk of coming up short of coins for the meter.
Also in the transportation arena, smart traffic management is used to monitor and analyse traffic flows in order to optimise streetlights and prevent roadways from becoming too congested based on the time of day.
Smart public transit is another facet of smart cities, used to ensure public transportation meets user demand. Smart transit companies are able to coordinate services and fulfil riders’ needs in real time, improving efficiency and rider satisfaction.
It is not a big hoo-ha that nowadays people prefer to live and work in a smart area which has a seamless connection dubbed the transit-oriented development (TOD). It is a mixed-use residential and commercial area designed to maximise access to public transport, and often incorporates features to encourage transit ridership.
Energy conservation and efficiency are major focuses of smart cities. Using smart sensors, smart streetlights dim when there aren’t cars or pedestrians on the roadways. Smart grid technology can be used to improve operations, maintenance and planning, and to supply power on demand and monitor energy outages.
Smart city initiatives also aim to monitor and address environmental concerns such as climate change and air pollution.
Waste management and sanitation can also be improved with smart technology, be it using internet-connected trash cans and IoT-enabled fleet management systems for waste collection and removal, or using sensors to measure water parameters and guarantee the quality of drinking water at the front end of the system, with proper wastewater removal and drainage at the back end.
Smart city technology is increasingly being used to improve public safety, from monitoring areas of high crime to improve emergency preparedness with sensors. For example, smart sensors can be critical components of an early warning system before droughts, floods, landslides or hurricanes.
How smart city works
Mustapha says smart cities utilise their web of connected IoT devices and other technologies to achieve their goals of improving the quality of life and achieving economic growth. Successful smart cities follow four steps:
1. Collection – Smart sensors throughout the city gather data in real time.2. Analysis – Data collected by the smart sensors are assessed in order to draw meaningful insights.3. Communication – The insights that have been found in the analysis phase are communicated with decision makers through strong communication networks.4. Action – Cities use the insights pulled from the data to create solutions, optimise operations and asset management and improve the quality of life for residents.
Fostering sustainability
Sustainability is another major facet of smart cities. Urbanisation is expected to increase even more in the coming years.
The United Nations reported that around 55% of the world’s population currently resides in an urban area or city; this figure is set to rise 68% throughout the coming decades.
Smart technology will help cities sustain growth and improve efficiency for citizen welfare and government efficiency in urban areas in the years to come.
Making the switch to an electric public transportation system would not only decrease fuel emissions, but could also pose the advantage of working closely with the city’s electric power infrastructure in order to minimise the impact of charging batteries during peak hours of electric use.
Furthermore, with proper coordination, electric vehicles could also be used to regulate the frequency of the city’s electric grid when they’re not in service.
The number of cars used in cities is also expected to decrease as municipalities become smarter. Autonomous vehicles, or self-driving cars, could potentially change a population’s perspective on the necessity of owning cars.
Smart city challenges and concerns
According to Muhammad Imran, the current situation, the global meltdown of the economy especially due to coronavirus and the fragile nature of oil prices are some of the key challenges faced.
“Innovative and design thinking should be promoted to create technology and its ecosystem in Malaysia as the supply chain is already there. Moreover, the emphasis of internet protocol towards the smart city eco-system should be created. We should need to think big but start small,” he says.
Nevertheless, Mustapha says smart city initiatives must include the people they aim to help – residents, business, people and visitors.
“The government must not only raise awareness of the benefits of the smart city technologies being implemented, but also promote the use of open, democratised data to its citizens.
“If people know what they are participating in and the benefits it can bring, they are more likely to engage,” he says.
Therefore, fostering collaboration between the public and private sectors and city residents is key to creating smart citizens who will be engaged and empowered and positively contribute to the city and community.
According to Mustapha, new and innovative collaboration methods can improve engagement.
Smart city projects should include plans to make the data transparent and available to citizens, often through an open data portal or mobile app. This enables residents to engage with the data and understand what it is used for.
He said residents may use a smart city app to be able to complete personal chores, such as viewing their home’s energy consumption, paying bills and finding efficient public transportation.
The presence of sensors and cameras may be perceived as an invasion of privacy or government surveillance. To address this, smart city data collected should be anonymised and not be personally identifiable information.
The thousands or millions of IoT devices scattered across the city would be defunct without a solid connection, and the smart city itself would be dead.
Furthermore, Mustapha says public transit, traffic management, public safety, water and waste management, electricity and natural gas supply can be unreliable, especially as a system ages and grows.
However, the importance of these operations will only increase as the city expands and the demands on its infrastructure increase. These systems must be constantly maintained and tested to ensure their proper functioning.
What is a smart city?
In the last several years, there has been an explosive growth of information and communications technologies (ICTs) due to the advancement of hardware and software designs.
Arkitek Mustapha Kamal Sdn Bhd principal Mustapha Kamal Zulkarnain says explains that the use of ICT in cities in various forms for different activities has led to the increased effectiveness of city operations, and these cities have been labelled using many terms such as “cyberville,” “digital city,” “electronic city,” “flexicity,” “information city,” “telicity,” “wired city” and “smart city.”
“Smart city” is the largest abstraction among the labels used, as it encompasses other labels used for cities.
Characteristics
According to Mustapha, there are nine major characteristics used to determine a city’s smartness. They include a technology-based infrastructure, environmental initiatives, a high-functioning public transportation system, a confident sense of urban planning, and humans to live and work within the city and utilise its resources.
A smart city’s success depends on its ability to form a strong relationship between the government – including its bureaucracy and regulations – and the private sector.
This relationship is necessary because most of the work that is done to create and maintain a digital, data-driven environment occurs outside of the government. Surveillance equipment for busy streets could include sensors from one company, cameras from another and a server from yet another.
According to a news report dated Jan 20, Local Government Minister Zuraida Kamaruddin was quoted saying that Pengerang in Johor has been targeted to become a smart city in five years.

 If you want to gauge the recent interest in developing autonomous trucks, follow the money. 
Tech startups and established OEMs alike have since early 2019 announced billions of dollars of funding for autonomous vehicle initiatives. This March, even the Canadian Pension Plan (CPP) Investment Board was part of a $2.25-billion investment round in Waymo, the former Google self-driving car project that has expanded into trucking.
In other words, some of your retirement savings are banking that a future truck will perform selected driving tasks as well as you can. Maybe better.
“We’re aggressively ramping up our investment in the trucking application,” says Waymo’s product manager for trucking, Matt Carroll, a native of London, Ont. “We will likely see fully driverless trucks across the industry begin to hit the road within the coming years.”
Truck drivers are not expected to be replaced by such trucks anytime soon. Tests on some of today’s most sophisticated autonomous prototypes are focusing on clearly defined routes and tasks. But some of the required technical capabilities are already emerging in trucks on the market.
Daimler and Volvo have in recent months also unveiled dedicated business units to explore autonomous vehicle technologies. And Europe’s ZF, which has already demonstrated an autonomous shunt truck and container-hauling configuration, has been named a manufacturing partner for TuSimple, one of the largest tech startups focused on the vision.
“We have experienced a significant increase in inquiries from customers,” said Volvo president and CEO Martin Lundstedt, during the launch of Volvo Autonomous Solutions. “It is a logical next step for us to gather expertise and resources in a new business area with profit and loss responsibility to take autonomous transport solutions to the next level.”
Autonomous vehicle tests
For some companies, that next level involves taking test vehicles onto tracks and even the open highway. TuSimple’s fleet of 41 autonomous-capable trucks are pulling 13 loads per day between Arizona and Texas. It’s teamed up with UPS, Penske Truck Leasing, U.S. Xpress and McLane to launch an Autonomous Freight Network by 2024, consisting of autonomous trucks, digitally mapped routes, strategic terminal locations, and a proprietary monitoring system.
“The potential for automating driving is just amazing,” said Daimler AG truck and bus leader Martin Daum, when recently announcing the OEM was taking a majority stake in Torc Robotics – a business developing the artificial intelligence (AI) needed to read the road and make driving decisions.
Suman Narayanan, DTNA’s director of engineering – autonomous technology group, refers to Torc’s primary contribution as a “software stack” that draws on data collected through radar, lidar and cameras. Related successes were some of the keys to developing the Asimov system for self-driving cars, and supported Caterpillar’s retrofit of autonomous mining trucks.
“It’s a giant leap in terms of technology advancement,” Narayanan says of the shift from Level 2 to Level 4.
The limits of technology
But even those who develop autonomous vehicle systems stress the limits to the technologies. The need to focus on defined operating areas tops them all.
“Our focus is not on urban traffic,” Narayanan said as an example, noting that the early applications will be specific highways. “We want to start where we can maximize value.”
“No one will lose their job with this technology,” agrees TuSimple head of government and public affairs Robert Brown. He’s confident that someone starting a career as a truck driver today would still retire behind the wheel, with emerging systems focusing on routes like those between distribution centers. “We’re not talking dense urban downtown Vancouver or something like that.”
“We’re not removing brake pedals and steering wheels from the vehicles,” he adds.
One high-profile prototype did remove the cab, though. Volvo’s Vera is better described as a self-directed chassis rather than a truck.
Sasko Cuklev, director – autonomous solutions at Volvo Trucks, says its first assignments will involve shuttling containers a “short distance” from a Swedish logistics center to a port. It’s the type of work that he envisions as an early adopter of autonomous technologies: “Hub-to-hub applications with shorter distances, repetitive flows, high volumes of goods, lower speed, typically A-to-B transport. For example, from a port to a distribution center, port to a manufacturing plant, or in between distribution centers.”
The port settings align with a term Brown uses to describe the role of autonomous trucks: “Intermodal 2.0”. Truck drivers would still interact with equipment at both ends of any trip, supporting things like pickup and delivery applications. People would still be needed for support, oversight, inspections, deployment, and arrival.
In the process, the technologies would offer an extra level of safety systems, combining the unblinking eyes of things like cameras and lidar, and introducing responses that are faster than human reflexes. Throughout a conversation, Narayanan repeatedly refers to the technology as a layer of safety, comparing it to things like hours of service rules and other driver assistance systems.
“We also see the need to addressing the monotony that some of the highway driving can bring,” he says.
Platooning promise or limits
Other potential gains have been a matter of debate. The higher level of autonomous controls would be central to platooning, which involves tucking tractor-trailers from nose to tail, closing gaps in the name of aerodynamics.
Daimler abandoned that concept, arguing that the fuel economy gains are lost in real-world settings, as platoons break apart and re-establish themselves in traffic. Volvo has tested platoons with FedEx, but Cuklev declined to comment on early lessons.
In the midst of it all, some other autonomous vehicle initiatives have stopped dead in their test tracks.
Uber paid US $600 million to acquire Otto, which made headlines with a hands-free shipment of Budweiser beer in 2016. But it dropped the idea of autonomous trucks shortly after inking a legal settlement with Waymo, which had accused former employee and Otto founder Anthony Levandowski of stealing information.
Meanwhile, Starsky Robotics shut down earlier this year, only months after sending a truck 15 kilometers down a Florida expressway without a driver in the cab. Driving at both ends of the trip was accomplished remotely, with an operator working controls in an office setting. In the wake of the closure, company founder Stefan Seltz-Axmacher openly questioned factors that attract investors, and highlighted the slow advance of artificial intelligence.
“The space was too overwhelmed with the unmet promise of [artificial intelligence] to focus on a practical solution,” he wrote in a blog for Medium. “As those breakthroughs failed to appear, the downpour of investor interest became a drizzle. It also didn’t help that last year’s tech IPOs took a lot of energy out of the tech industry, and that trucking has been in a recession for 18 or so months.”
“The systems cannot have faults that require the human to intervene,” he said. “The reliability of the vehicle needs to be second to none.”
Like a ‘phenomenal’ truck driver
The goal is for autonomous vehicle systems that do everything a “phenomenal” human driver does today, Narayanan says, referring to the need for redundant systems.
“Right now, the failsafe we have in our truck is a human driver,” he continues. They know how to respond to an ABS warning lamp in the dash, for example. “We must have a brake system or steering system that is built in such a way that they can monitor their health constantly.”
There’s no room for error. Any failures could be disastrous.
While autonomous truck test have been spared high-profile accidents, the same can’t be said for autonomous cars. Elaine Herzberg was struck and killed by an Uber test vehicle in Arizona. A Tesla traveling in its “autopilot” mode failed to identify the side of a white trailer. Such collisions also seem to combine technical failures and operator error. The drivers behind the wheel tended to be engaged in other activities, like watching movies.
Ongoing barriers are not limited to technology alone.
“We can handle pretty wild weather,” Brown insists, referring to successful tests that have ranged from high winds to night driving. The one notable exception is finding a way to track vehicle positions in snow. “It’s definitely on our road map.” It’s just not there yet.
“Surface streets are a much more challenging domain compared to freeways since they tend to be more unstructured, the differences between one and another tend to vary more — while highways are pretty similar to one another — and there are more long-tail events to consider,” says Waymo’s Carroll.
The practical considerations don’t end there. Who would a CVSA inspector or law enforcement officer interact with when a Level 4 truck controls itself, Brown asks. Issues like that would likely leave any autonomous trucks in the hands of specialized users.
‘A very sticky relationship’
“It’ll be a very sticky relationship, so with won’t be like you can buy a truck and just run it,” he says of TuSimple’s model. “There’s data infrastructure. There’s a lot that goes into this, the mapping, so it can’t just be, ‘buy a truck off the shelf.’”
The rules that govern such trucks need to evolve as well, even though they are expected to share routes traveled by human drivers. But there has been movement. The U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Administration has already unveiled some of the guidance that vehicle developers need to follow.
“We are seeing significant investments in more advanced Automated Driving Systems (ADS) that might one day allow vehicles to drive themselves and thereby have the potential to greatly reduce the number of fatal crashes involving human error or poor choices,” NHTSA acting administrator James Owens said in November, in testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
“But as with any revolution, these developments also carry uncertainty. Advanced technologies may not always work as designed or advertised… If the history of other vehicle technologies is any guide, some versions of these technologies will work better than others.”
Early in 2018, Canada’s Senate Committee on Transport and Communications expressed concerns that Canada is ill-prepared for the arrival of autonomous vehicles, too.
“It is not a matter of if,” the Senate report concluded, “but when more sophisticate automated and connected vehicles will arrive on Canadian roads.”

Of all the potential benefits offered by smart cities, one of the most enticing is greatly improved transportation networks.
As Australia’s major urban areas grapple with the challenges of rising traffic congestion and overcrowded public transportation links, finding ways to make systems more efficient is vital.
Smart city strategies could hold the key.
According to research conducted by KPMG and social enterprise organisation Public Sector Network, smart mobility is one of the top priorities for centres undertaking smart city projects.
Of the cities surveyed, more than half (51 per cent) nominated mobility-as-a-service and congestion management as the key objectives for their programs.Advertisement
Managing director of online automotive marketplace Carsales Australia, Ajay Bhatia, says workplace changes ushered in by the COVID-19 virus are further hastening the need for a smart-city approach to transportation.
Bhatia says research conducted by his firm has found people’s preference for using their own car has increased in the past two months because of infection fears around using public transport.
“Our research found that, of those people who don’t own a car, more than half are now considering buying one,” he says.
As more people return to their workplaces in coming weeks, a new fondness for cars could lead to an increase in traffic congestion and extended commute times.
Traffic congestion management
This could occur despite previous campaigns mounted by authorities to encourage people to consider public transport alternatives.
“Now, more than ever, we need to manage traffic congestion and in a smart city you can do that,” says Bhatia.
“We can use sensor networks and internet of things (IoT) devices to understand when and where peaks occur, where accidents occur, and where people tend to speed.
“When you understand these factors, you can manage traffic flows much better.”
City of Melbourne chief digital officer, Michelle Fitzgerald, says creating an efficient transportation infrastructure within a smart city requires the connection of a range of elements from vehicles and traffic lights, to trams, buses, cyclists, and pedestrians. This, in turn, allows all road users to connect with each other, thereby making the overall system more efficient.
“The City of Melbourne’s Transport Strategy 2030 commits to trial and support new technologies and service models to manage demand for road space to move more people in less space,” she says.
Innovations within the strategy include smarter traffic signals, dynamic lighting solutions, and improved safety for pedestrians.
Sensors in footpaths
Fitzgerald says the city has already installed thousands of sensors in footpaths across the central business district.
This generates a data feed of pedestrian volumes that can be compared with similar time periods in previous weeks or months.
“We can see the impact of various factors such as major events or extreme weather conditions on pedestrian activity and compare the flow to short and long-term averages,” she says.
Melbourne city has also deployed more than 4300 in-ground sensors under street-based car parking bays. These detect vehicle movements in and out of the bays and the length of time each is occupied.
Data is used by parking officers to ensure compliance with restrictions and is also made publicly available to promote creativity.
“There are now a range of free apps available which track Melbourne’s on-street carparks, making it easier than ever to find a carpark,” says Fitzgerald.
Melbourne’s smart-city approach to transportation is similar to that being taken by other cities around the world.
Helsinki example
Many are using data collected via sensor networks to ensure different types of transportation run more efficiently by enabling tighter integration of services.
One example is the Finnish capital of Helsinki. The city has invested heavily on building an integrated transportation network that has reduced traffic congestion and improved the quality of life for residents.
Helsinki-based transport planner Ian Sacs says creating multi-modal transportation infrastructures is an important step towards creating a truly smart city.
“A smart city is one that offers the community a menu of transportation choices,” he says. “The broader that menu, the more options people have. The more options they have, the more trips are distributed across different transportation types. It then ends up being a more robust and resilient city which adds up to being smart.”
Sacs says Helsinki has succeeded in keeping walking and bicycling as a significant part of its transportation mix. These activities currently represent about a third of all trips in the city.
Different vehicle types
Helsinki has built a street network that was designed specifically to cater for a mix of different vehicle types.
There is also an established network of bike paths which mean many trips can be completed without having to ride on a roadway at all.
“Another third of trips in the city are by public transport. [The city has] maintained its love of the tram system and because it is combined with rail, busses and ferries, there is a great mix of transportation modes.”
“Finland and Helsinki have also been good at using technology to support this type of transportation mix,” says Sacs.
“The country has been a pioneer of a concept known as ‘mobility-as-a-service’. This allows different transportation providers to offer their services on a common platform which makes it much easier for residents to choose between different modes.”
Sacs says he is encouraged by the rising number of smart city transportation projects being undertaken around the world.
“You’ve got to get the basics right first,” he says. “If you design the basic infrastructure correctly, it should be easy for cities to accommodate new technologies as they come along in the future.”
A big part of the transport story is ensuring we slowly decarbonise our cities and this will increasingly rely on decentralising energy storage and distribution.
Electric vehicles
According to AGL’s general manager future business Ayala Domani, decentralisation involves home owners, businesses or small communities operating electricity generation such as solar panels or storage assets like batteries for their own use.
“Essentially energy is generated where it is needed,” Ayala says.
“These ‘distributed assets’ help increase the resilience of the grid, better manage supply and demand, and decarbonise the energy sector which includes transport.
“As we decarbonise AGL anticipates the uptake of electric vehicles will be much stronger than what we’ve seen with the uptake of home batteries.
“There will be a broader range of EV models, concerns over how far you can drive will be far less prevalent due to fast charging infrastructure, and prices will fall to the same as an internal combustion engine,” Ayala says.
 “In this scenario, by 2030 more than half of all new sales will be electric vehicles, which is 2.6 million vehicles and 15 per cent of the customer passenger fleet,” she concludes.

• The connected e-bike sharing solution designed by the Italian company MERMEC appointed Honoree at CES 2021 Innovation Awards, in the Vehicle Intelligence and Transportation category
• The Company announces a new agreement with Swedish operator Voi Technology
VAIMOO, the connected e-bike sharing solution designed by Mermec,  the Italian multinational company providing advanced transport technologies, is the only Italian project  to receives the CES 2021 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Vehicle Intelligence and Transportation  category.
 
VAIMOO – Vehicles Artificial Intelligence MO(O)ved – is the complete e-bike sharing solution including  electric bikes, charging stations and mobile apps for using the service, which improves fleet distribution  and maintenance through artificial intelligence algorithms, real-time geo-location and operational data  from the field. 
The system has been designed to adapt to any micro-mobility and last-mile transport scenarios, both  public and private, and exploits the full potential of IoT (Internet of Things) technologies for rapid  integration with other transport systems, such as metro, train or bus, aiming to ensure a unique and  well-integrated travel experience. 
The attention to user-friendliness can be experienced even before getting on the saddle. Indeed,  starting a ride is very easy: just tap the smartphone on the dedicated surface on the e-bike handlebars  to automatically start the VAIMOO app and unlock the electric bike. In addition, the smartphone can be  used as a bike display and smart navigator. E-bikes can be found in the docking stations as well as in  free-floating mode around the city, thus flexibly meeting the needs of municipalities and different users,  such as tourists, commuters or students. 
For all these reasons, in addition to the prestigious CES award, the company announces the signing of  a new agreement with Swedish Voi Technology – Europe’s leading micro-mobility service provider – which has chosen VAIMOO connected e-bikes to extend and differentiate its e-scooter sharing service  in the UK. This agreement follows VAIMOO’s launch in Copenhagen and Rotterdam. 
‘We are honoured and excited to be awarded the CES Innovation Awards with VAIMOO’ claimed Matteo  Pertosa, Project Director and Member of the Board of Directors at Mermec ‘This is the third time  in the last four years that one of the Angel Group companies has received this award, but it’s always a  great result for the whole team and a further confirmation of the validity of our solution that aims to  contribute to the creation of an intermodal and inclusive transport system, now essential in every  metropolitan city. Unlike scooters, e-bikes are very ‘democratic’ because anyone can easily use them. 
For us, 2021 will be an important year full of news, with the signing of strategic agreements and product  developments that will allow us to grow steadily in the international market.’
The CES Innovation Awards is an annual competition honouring outstanding design and engineering in  consumer technology products across 28 product categories. The awards are assigned by a  distinguished panel of industry designers, engineers and media who, through the CES Innovation  Awards, identify unique products, future trends and technologies developed by industry to change the  lives of society.

 More roads and lanes are simply not the solution to ever-increasing traffic woes. 
By  Beth Osborne 
If you ask the average person how to solve traffic congestion, a large majority would say widen the roads and add more lanes.
This response seems intuitive, but it’s misguided. That’s because of “induced demand” — a phenomenon when the supply of a good increases, more of that same good is consumed — ultimately leading to greater use of our roadways.
Yet we’ve all seen it happen — widen a road, and new traffic materializes to fill it right back up. In fact, a recent academic study from California State University showed that every 1% increase in road capacity guarantees a 1% increase in vehicle miles traveled.
Hawaii’s strategy for solving traffic congestion fits the definition of insanity. Recent mandated work-from-home scenarios aside, the state has been doing the same thing over and over again for decades while expecting a different result.
Hawaii’s residents and elected leaders have been conned to believe that more roads and lanes are the solution to ever-increasing traffic congestion. And it’s been incredibly expensive.
A Losing Strategy
Every year, local media report how bad congestion is on Oahu. The average Oahu driver spends 64 hours in congestion each year, according to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute’s 2019 Urban Mobility Report. Unfortunately, the state has been spending vast sums of money on a strategy that promises relief, but only makes it worse.
As American historian and philosopher of technology Lewis Mumford bluntly put it, “Building more roads to prevent congestion is like a fat man loosening his belt to prevent obesity.”
That’s precisely what Hawaii has done. Between 1993 and 2017, Honolulu’s population increased by 23% while lane-miles increased by 8%. Congestion, however, spiked by a disproportionate 166%.
Hawaii’s strategy for solving traffic congestion fits the definition of insanity.
Perhaps Hawaii just didn’t build enough new road capacity to keep up with population growth? Scores of other metro areas tried that particular strategy, and they failed as well. Adding more lanes faster than population also fails to reduce congestion, as shown in The Congestion Con, a report released by Transportation for America earlier this year.
Between 1993 and 2017, the nation’s 100 largest urbanized areas added 30,511 new freeway lane-miles in these areas, an increase of 42% — which is greater than the 32% growth in population in those regions over the same time period. Still, delay and congestion exploded by 144%.
At The Expense Of Basic Repair
All of this new roadway capacity is coming at the expense of basic repair, which poll after poll shows is where most voters want transportation agencies to focus their resources.
In 2017, 42% of Hawaii’s roads were in poor condition — only California and Rhode Island had a larger share in poor condition. Nevertheless, Hawaii still spent more on expanding roads than repairing existing ones: $86 million per year on average spent on road expansion between 2009 and 2014 versus $82 million spent on road repair each year on average.
Each new road is more properly considered a liability, not an asset. Every time Hawaii chooses to neglect a repair project in favor of building a new road or widening an existing one, Hawaii increases the amount of funding required to maintain the system.
Every new road brings decades of maintenance costs that are almost never accounted for. According to Federal Highway Administration data and Transportation for America’s analysis, it costs about $24,000 per lane-mile per year to keep a good road in “good” condition. (Those costs are likely higher in Hawaii).
These enormous “investments” might have been worth it if congestion were being reduced. But that’s the con — it isn’t.
Growth in freeway lane-miles and population growth in the largest 100 U.S. urbanized areas from 1993 to 2017.
Transportation for America
In fact, in all 100 regions, not one region saw its congestion go down or even hold steady. This remains true across all population scenarios, whether population increased faster, slower, declined, or at the same pace. It didn’t matter — they all had increases in congestion.
Transportation for America isn’t the only one reporting this kind of data. Take the Hawaii Department of Transportation’s word for it. Hawaii’s current Fiscal Biennium 2019-2021 Operating and Capital Budget forecasts an 11% increase in vehicle miles traveled by 2024. The department is essentially saying that if we implement its program, more people will drive more. Given Hawaii’s climate commitments, this is a step in the wrong direction.
So what does address congestion and delay?
As the state looks ahead and identifies short- and long-term recovery spending, we would be wise to consider the following:
Stop inducing demand through futile expansion of road capacity. More lane-miles means more incentives to drive more, which will only increase the congestion.Continue to shift state and county land-use and transportation policies away from enabling auto dominance. In decision-making, prioritize moving people, not vehicles.Likewise, design public streets for moving people, not vehicles. Employ “quick build” approaches using flexible, low-cost installation materials, such as paint and moveable barriers to support walking, biking and transit to expedite results.Expose the hidden costs of parking and driving for users. Stop forcing non-drivers to financially support drivers.Invest dramatically in the increased capacity and funding of active modes. This means not just a project here and there, but building the technical support and funding to match our desired community goals around active transportation.
It’s time for Hawaii to stop spending money it doesn’t have to build roads that it doesn’t need, while failing to provide the core function of getting people to jobs and services each day by any mode necessary. It’s time to stop falling for the congestion con.

As we start a new decade, it’s a good time to reflect on expectations for the next 10 years. Tyler thinks the Great Stagnation could be ending. Caleb sees cracks. Noah expresses techno-optimism. In this post, my aim is not to predict an end or non-end to stagnation. Rather, it is to think through the particulars of how technology could evolve over the next decade. Then we can assess separately whether we should consider it the Roaring 20s or the Boring 20s.
What would constitute an end to the Great Stagnation? Any precise cutoff will be arbitrary, but for the sake of discussion, let’s say sustained growth in utilization-adjusted total factor productivity of 2 percent per year. By comparison, mean utilization-adjusted TFP growth from 1947 through 1972 was 2.1 percent. Since 2005, it has been 0.17 percent. (Note: it is important to use the utilization-adjusted series, as this corrects for the business cycle.)
Whatever your cutoff for TFP growth, one of my convictions is that scientific breakthroughs alone are not enough to drive an end to the Great Stagnation. TFP only budges when new technologies are adopted at scale, and generally this means products, not just science. Science lays critical groundwork for new technology, but after all the science is done, much work remains. Someone must shepherd the breakthrough to the product stage, where it can actually affect TFP. This means building businesses, surmounting regulatory obstacles, and scaling production.
With that caveat firmly in mind, what will the next decade bring in terms of meaningful technological change? Here’s what I’m watching.
Biotech and health
We are coming off a huge win: two new mRNA COVID vaccines, conceived and brought to market in less than a year. The ability to encode and deploy arbitrary mRNA in our bodies sure seems like a game changer—it allows us to essentially program our cells to make whatever proteins we want. In the case of the COVID vaccines, the vaccine payload instructs our cells to make the coronavirus spike protein, which our immune system then learns to attack. Bert Hubert has a fascinating write-up of the “code” in the vaccine.
Bringing a brand new vaccine to market in less than a year—using a never-before-applied-in-humans-at-scale technology no less—is a world record, but it could have been even faster. As David Wallace-Wells emphasizes, Moderna’s vaccine was designed by January 13. We had it the whole time. Some delay was necessary to determine effective dosing. Some further regulatory delay may have been warranted to ensure the vaccine was safe and to ascertain its efficacy. But as Wallace-Wells indicates, the regulatory outcome was never really in doubt. “None of the scientists I spoke to for this story were at all surprised by either outcome,” he writes. “All said they expected the vaccines were safe and effective all along.”
What should we make of the fact that all of the scientists knew all along that Moderna’s vaccine would work? The question in my mind is: what other mRNA treatments do we have the whole time? What if I told you Moderna has an HIV vaccine candidate? HIV lacks SARS-CoV-2’s telltale spike protein and thus may prove a more challenging foe—but don’t you wonder, if we treated the problem with real urgency, whether new mRNA technology could wipe out the AIDS epidemic this decade? I do.
And mRNA technology can be deployed against more than just viruses. Both Moderna and BioNTech have personalized vaccine candidates targeting cancer. Although called a “cancer vaccine,” the treatment is only administered once the subject has cancer—it isn’t preventative. The companies use an algorithm to analyze the genetic sequences of the tumor and the patient’s healthy cells and predict which molecules could be used to generate a strong immune response against the cancer. “I was actually witnessing the cancer cells shrinking before my eyes,” said Brad Kremer, a melanoma patient who received the BioNTech treatment. So let’s milk mRNA technology for all it’s worth this decade. It can save us from more than just a pandemic.
What about CRISPR? It is a great example of a technology that has not yet made a meaningful economic contribution. Although the technique for editing DNA was discovered in 2012—and a Nobel Prize was awarded to its two discoverers this year—no treatment using CRISPR has been approved outside of clinical trials. So far, its impact has been limited to making researchers more productive—not a bad thing, to be sure, but not close to CRISPR’s full potential. As trials progress, however, I do think some CRISPR treatments will come online in the next few years, especially those targeting genetic disorders that we have very limited means of otherwise treating.
DeepMind’s protein-folding breakthrough signals a promising decade for the science of proteomics. Most directly, being able to predict protein shapes will enable us to discover drugs more rapidly. Buuuut, because drug trials take many years, we might expect this technology not to really be felt by the general public until the 2030s.
What DeepMind’s achievement indicates to me the most is that machine learning is actually useful. This might seem obvious, but consider: most applications of machine learning so far—excluding autonomous vehicles, which have themselves not really arrived yet—are toys. I love watching AlphaZero crush Stockfish on YouTube, but chess is literally a game. GPT-3 produced some fun demos. AlphaFold heralds something different—non-toy superhuman performance is now here, and I am interested to see what else it can do. Aside from the aforementioned AVs, I expect it to be applied widely in other areas of biology. Again, it will take a long time for the breakthroughs to trickle down into products, but at least the 2030s should be sick. I mean, not sick. Healthy.
Let’s talk about life extension, one of my favorite biotech topics. 2020 was a big year for the Conboy Lab at Berkeley, which proved that all the weird past findings about “young blood” extending life were not actually due to any elixir in the blood of children (thank goodness). Rather, the rejuvenating aspects of young blood experiments were due to the dilution of harmful factors in old blood. By mechanically removing plasma and replacing it with saline and enough albumin to replace what was taken out, they diluted aged blood factors in both mice and humans and were able to rejuvenate germ layer tissues and improve cognition by reducing neuroinflammation.
These findings are exciting not only because they represent a scientific advance in understanding aging, but also because they herald the first real anti-aging product that could come to market. Therapeutic plasma exchange is FDA-approved (not for aging, but for a bunch of other conditions). I imagine there remain prohibitions on advertising that it can add years to your life, but it is safe, and a doctor can prescribe it off label. It’s also cheap. An automated plasmapheresis machine—which lets you do treatment after treatment—can be bought online for under $3,000. That is less than the cost of a single transfusion of young blood sold by the startup Ambrosia. How long until someone opens a clinic offering plasma dilution? I bet someone tries it in 2021. If it works, people will get over the weirdness, and it could be commonplace by 2030.
Another longevity product that is about to get hot: aging clocks based on DNA methylation or proteomics. Do you want to know how biologically old you are? Today, for a few hundred dollars, you can get a test that will tell you. As these tests become better and cheaper, self-experimenters are going to have a field day. Doing before-and-after aging tests, anyone who can get their hands on human growth hormone could replicate the protocol used by Fahy et al. to rejuvenate the thymus. As the thymus is a critical element of the immune system, decline of which is a critical factor in aging, this is non-trivial rejuvenation. The Fahy study found that 12 months of treatment created about 2.5 years of epigenetic rejuvenation, with results accelerating in the last quarter of the trial.
There is a lot more in the Rejuvenation Roadmap—dozens of possible life-extending treatments are at various stages of development. There’s a good chance a few senolytic drugs will be approved by the end of the decade. As I noted yesterday at Fortune, we spend less than 1% of the NIH budget on aging biology—we should raise that by a lot.
Unlike others, I am not-so-bullish on metformin. It does seem to reduce all-cause mortality in Americans, but it may do so because 88% of Americans are metabolically unhealthy. If you are one of the 12%, and you should strive to be, I don’t think metformin will do much for you.
One final biotech observation: every year, the Apple Watch gets a new health-related sensor. This year it was blood oxygen, pretty good for detecting if you might have COVID! Fast forward to 2030 and wearables will have at least 10 more health-related sensors than they do today. Some no-brainers are body temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose sensors. What will the other 7 be? At some point, it becomes possible to replace a lot of primary care with continuous monitoring. A few smart algorithms to provide simple medical advice could improve population-level health without much cost. More data could also yield faster, more accurate, and of course more remote diagnoses when you do have to see a doctor.
There is a lot in biotech that is promising right now, but in more than any other field, it is important not to be seduced by the sexy headlines showing rapid scientific progress. Don’t get complacent. Biology is proceeding faster than medical productivity because a lot of the wonderful discoveries are not being translated into approved treatments and products at a decent rate. Let’s salute and cheer for the discoveries, but spare many thoughts for the entrepreneurs trying to bring treatments to market.
Energy
The 2010s were the wind and solar decade. We observed stunning declines in the cost of both, although total deployment of wind and solar remains small—in 2019, wind and solar represented less than 9 percent of utility-scale electricity generation in the US. In the 2020s, cost declines will likely stall—wind and solar are already pretty cheap, so the declines of the past decade are not reproducible. Deployment, on the other hand, will accelerate.
Mass deployment of wind and solar will bring challenges. These sources are highly intermittent. When the wind suddenly stops blowing—which happens—we need a way to quickly make up the deficit. Each of the three electricity grids in the continental US—east, west, and Texas—has to remain in supply-demand balance every second of every day. We can use grid storage to smooth out some of the bumps, but storage remains expensive. To reach a grid powered entirely by today’s renewables, we would need storage at a price of $20 per kWh (with caveats).
That storage doesn’t all have to come from batteries, but let’s talk about batteries for a bit. Using Tesla’s grid-scale Powerpack as data, a 232 kWh battery today costs $125,793. That is a price of over $542/kWh. Through innovation, that pricetag will come down over the course of this decade, but improvements on the supply side could easily get swamped by increases in demand. After all, this decade will also include a huge shift toward electric vehicles, which I will discuss below. When demand outpaces supply, prices tend to stay high, even when there is impressive innovation.
With increased deployment of intermittent power generation, increased total demand for electricity due to electric vehicles, a high cost of grid storage, inadequate electricity transmission (have I mentioned that we often neglect to build in this country?), and strong political support for decommissioning fossil fuel plants, the 2020s may be a time of electric grid instability. This could be tempered to some extent by using car batteries as grid resources and through (politically unpopular) variable electricity prices.
Ultimately, we need scalable zero-carbon baseload energy, which means nuclear or geothermal. The problem with nuclear is the high cost. If you look at NuScale’s small modular reactor technology, they are targeting 6.5¢/kWh. That is baseload power, so not directly comparable to wind and solar’s intermittent generation costs, but even so, it isn’t the most competitive in today’s market. Furthermore, NuScale’s flagship project was just delayed three years and is now not scheduled to come online until 2030.
What is more plausible this decade is enhanced and advanced geothermal systems. The legacy geothermal industry is sleepy, tapping energy at traditional volcanic hydrothermal hotspots—forget about it. The next generation of the industry, however, is a bunch of scrappy startups manned by folks leaving the oil and gas industry. The startups I have spoken to think with today’s technology they can crack 3.5¢/kWh without being confined to volcanic regions. With relatively minor advancements in drilling technology compared to what we’ve seen over the last decade, advanced geothermal could reach 2¢/kWh and become scale to become viable just about anywhere on the planet. Collectively, the startups are talking about figures like hundreds of gigawatts of generation by 2030. I’m watching this space closely; the Heat Beat blog is a great way to stay in the loop. As I wrote last month, permitting reform will be important.
Fusion continues to make technical progress. I expect we will get a demonstration of energy-positive fusion in this decade from one of several fusion startups or perhaps Lockheed Martin’s compact fusion reactor. But again: a demonstration is far from a change that transforms society. It will take further decades to deploy reactors onto the grid. By the time fusion gets there, the energy market will be quite different from when we started working on fusion reactors in the 1940s. Wind, solar, and hopefully geothermal will make electricity pretty cheap, and fusion will struggle to compete.
Consider: around half the cost of an advanced geothermal plant is drilling, and half is conversion equipment. Suppose the plant is amortized over 30 years (although many geothermal plants last longer), and after that period the conversion equipment needs to be replaced. But the hole in the ground does not need to be replaced! That means for the next 30 years, electricity can be generated at half the initial cost. Geothermal wells we dig this decade could be producing at less than 1¢/kWh by the 2050s. That is a tough market for fusion to break into. But fusion will still be a great source of power in applications where other sources aren’t available, such as in space.
The 2020s will be a big decade for sustainable alternative fuels (SAF). Commercial aviation can’t electrify—batteries will never match fossil fuels’ energy density. Given political realities, aviation has no choice to decarbonize, which means either hydrogen fuel or SAF. Hydrogen fuel is much better than batteries, but still not as energy dense as fossil fuels or SAF, and so my money is on SAF, and particularly on fuel made from CO₂ pulled from the atmosphere. It is easy to convert atmospheric CO₂ to ethanol in solution; and it is easy to upgrade ethanol into other fuels. But it is hard to separate ethanol from water without using a lot of energy—unless you have an advanced membrane as Prometheus Fuels does. I have written about Prometheus before and continue to follow them closely. Their technology could decarbonize aviation very suddenly.
One final note on energy: there may be very interesting geopolitical consequences in the decade ahead to America’s newfound energy independence. I could easily see, for example, the US deciding we actually don’t need an alliance with the Saudis after all, considering they are journalist-dismembering savages. If the US pulls out of Saudi Arabia, war between the Saudis and the Iranians becomes likely. Which means oil shipments to Asia get disrupted. Which means global chaos. This Zeihanesque scenario is only a scenario, but I’m watching for it.
Transportation
Here’s the thing about electric cars: they are better than regular cars. They have lower fuel costs. They have fewer moving parts and thus lower maintenance costs. They have higher low-end torque and faster acceleration. If you mainly drive to and from work and have a charger at home, you never have to stop for gas. Electric cars will win because they are better, and the shift will happen suddenly.
California will require that new cars purchased after 2035 have zero emissions. For most people, this will be a non-issue, as by 2035 most Californians would not dream of getting an internal combustion engine vehicle. I say this even as a relative battery price pessimist—or more accurately, I am a relative battery price pessimist because I think demand for batteries will be off the charts.
One area where batteries may not work (aside from aviation, already discussed) is trucking. Towing really heavy loads requires a lot of energy—hydrogen fuel cells will be more suited to interstate trucking. The transition from diesel to hydrogen in trucking will likely not be as automatic as the transition from gas to batteries in cars. It’s possible that truckers will need a bit of a push.
As cars shift to electric and trucks shift to hydrogen, air pollution will plummet, especially the currently unregulated ultrafine particles less than 0.1 μm in diameter which cause the worst health harms. There may still be larger particles from tires degrading and so on, but my view is that these do not cause serious health problems. Getting rid of the smallest particles, particularly from diesel fumes, will create health gains which may seem to appear out of nowhere. Fewer premature births, fewer cases of asthma, fewer cancers, fewer mystery illnesses.
Autonomous vehicles could finally happen at scale. Waymo is already in production with a driverless fleet in Phoenix. Tesla has a “full self-driving” computer which might not yet live up to the label, but is nonetheless very cool. Although we have all been continually disappointed by the promise of autonomy right around the corner, it does seem like it has to happen at some point. As sensors and computing power get cheaper, and machine learning algorithms get better, autonomy is inevitable. A decade is a long time, so I am reasonably confident it will happen in the 2020s. It could save a lot of lives. Autonomy, too, will accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles, as fleet companies will prefer the low maintenance costs of battery or fuel cell vehicles.
Let’s do aviation. As everyone knows, I am a huge fan of supersonics. I continue to cheer for my former colleagues at Boom, who will legitimately fly a supersonic aircraft in 2021. Supersonics will have an enormous impact on global business when it arrives at scale, but it’s looking like that won’t be in the 2020s—Boom’s most optimistic timeline per a recent article is a first full-scale airliner by 2026, then several years of certification tests, then a ramp in production to make it matter.
Other contenders: Aerion has a Mach-1.4 business jet design ready to enter production. The key question is whether they can raise the money to build the factory. The business jet market is small, so as an investor you really have to believe they will be able to parlay success on the AS2 into a future airliner program. Hermeus is working on a Mach-5 design point with 20 passengers. Exosonic is targeting Mach 1.8 with low boom technology that could allow it to operate over land. Gulfstream seems to have shuttered their supersonic business jet program, which was never announced in any case.
In addition to Boom’s XB-1 flight test program commencing in 2021, I’ll also be watching two other supersonic flight programs in the early 2020s. NASA’s X-59 will start flying over select cities in 2023 to collect data on acceptable levels of sonic boom. This will pave the way for new standards that unlock overland supersonic flight. NASA is literally making America boom again! In the next couple years, I also expect an unmanned demonstrator flight from Hermeus reaching as high as Mach 5. Awesome, right?
Aside from supersonics, the other exciting development in aviation is the proliferation of urban air mobility companies. Check out Joby, which recently acquired Uber’s Elevate division. Or Wisk, a joint venture between Boeing and Kitty Hawk. Both of these projects could enter service in the first half of the decade. Hyundai also has a new UAM division—look for their product to enter service near the end of the decade.
A key question in my mind regarding urban air mobility is whether regulations will allow autonomy. The business model doesn’t seem like it will work if you have to pay a pilot and lose the space associated with the pilot’s seat, which could otherwise serve an additional passenger. The FAA has been very incremental about allowing even small drones to fly beyond line-of-sight of the operator. In order for urban air mobility to compete with, say, Uber Black, FAA needs to adopt rules for low-altitude air traffic control (called UTM) and figure out a way to certify autonomous operations. Wisk seems pessimistic—they are targeting New Zealand as a first market.
Drone delivery is likely in the 2020s. FAA is about to issue a rule incrementally expanding drone operations, this time allowing operations at night and flights over crowds of people. This is how the FAA operates: use waiver authority to expand the scope of drone operations, and then once they are comfortable with that, make it into a generally applicable rule. I expect the process will incrementally allow bigger and bigger drone delivery programs until they become normal. Those of us who live within five miles of a Class B airport, however, may be out of luck the entire decade.
Let’s talk about tunnels. An efficiently governed country would need some tunnels, but perhaps not very many. China has added 25,000 km of (mostly non-tunnel) high-speed rail since 2008, and there is no technological reason why we couldn’t have done the same. But with a promiscuous distribution of the veto power, building long rail lines above ground becomes challenging. It may therefore be worth the high cost of tunneling to build new high-speed transport options.
The Boring Company has a small, near-operational “loop” under construction in Las Vegas. The project will whiz people around the convention center at up to 155 mph. Expansion plans include the Las Vegas Strip, the airport, and eventually connecting to Los Angeles. Another Boring project, currently mired in environmental review, is the DC-Baltimore Loop, which would connect the two cities’ downtowns in 15 minutes. All of Boring’s loops are designed to be compatible with hyperloop requirements, which would eventually enable 600-mph travel between major cities.
Although the full realization of this technology—a nationwide hyperloop network—is unlikely by 2030, even the 150-mph version is worth following. The time and hassle cost of travel is an important input into the gravity model of trade. I expect the DC-Baltimore Loop to significantly increase economic activity between the two cities—especially helping to revitalize Baltimore, as it would become easier to live there and work in DC.
Space
The big story in space technology for the next 10 years is Starship, as it will enable just about everything else. Let’s compare some launch costs. The Space Shuttle entered service in 1981 and launched successfully 134 times. Each launch cost an inflation-adjusted $1.8 billion. The payload cost to low-Earth orbit (LEO) was $65,400/kg. Today’s workhorse launch vehicle, the Falcon 9, can send cargo to LEO for $2,600/kg. That is a staggering decrease in launch costs.
Starship promises to take this trend much further. On Falcon 9, only the first stage is reusable, whereas on Starship, the entire system—both the booster and the space vehicle—is reusable. Starship runs on dirt cheap liquid methane instead of expensive rocket fuel. It is made out of stainless steel instead of more expensive traditional aerospace materials. SpaceX is talking about churning out Starships at a rate of one every 72 hours for a cost of $5 million each. Operating costs come down with a high flight rate, so Elon is figuring a $1.5-million fully burdened launch cost for 150 tons to LEO. That is $10/kg, more than 100 times cheaper than a Falcon 9 launch today.
It gets even more insane. Because Starship is designed to be refuelable on orbit, its 150-ton payload capacity to LEO equals its payload capacity to anywhere in the solar system. You will be able to launch 150 tons to LEO, load up on fuel while orbiting Earth, and then fly the same payload the rest of the way to the moons of Jupiter. The whole thing could cost less than one Falcon 9 launch—which is limited to 15 tons to LEO in a reusable configuration or 4 tons to Mars in an expendable configuration.
Let’s apply the gravity model of trade once more, this time to commerce between Earth and LEO. Meta-analyses have found that trade (on Earth) is roughly inverse-linear in transport costs. If that holds for space, a 200x cost reduction in travel between Earth and LEO should increase “trade” between Earth and LEO by 200x. Commerce between the Earth and the moon, or between the Earth and Mars, starting from a base close to zero, would be stimulated even more.
It’s worth noting a second-order effect of cheap launch costs. When launch is expensive, more engineering has to go into the payload to ensure reliability. You don’t want to spend $1.8 billion on launch, and then find out, as NASA did with the Hubble Space Telescope, that your new satellite needs repairs. This dynamic has caused over-engineering of space payloads. With launch for a new low price of $10-20/kg, companies and research agencies will be able to reduce engineering expenses by simply taking on the risk of paying for another (cheap) launch.
Since my guiding star is economically noticeable technological progress, let’s talk about that. SpaceX first landed a rocket booster five years ago. They have been undercutting all other players in the medium-lift launch market ever since. But in the grand scheme of things, launch is still a small market. Aside from getting to watch cool livestreams of boosters landing, Falcon 9 has probably not made a noticeable impact on your life (unless you work in the space industry).
That is finally beginning to change with Starlink. As of this month, there are 955 Starlink satellites providing Internet access to thousands of users in a “better-than-nothing” beta test. The constellation size could go as high as 42,000 satellites. Internet speeds are already over 100 mbps down—they seem to be only somewhat attenuated by bad weather. For many rural customers, the service is indeed much better than nothing—better than any other available alternative. With more (and more advanced) satellites in operation, speeds could reach a gigabit. With Starship, the cost of launching these thousands of satellites, and the speed at which the company could do so, will improve. Plan on a full buildout of the network this decade.
Starlink could be a cash cow. The service is not a good fit for most customers—urban populations are too dense and have too many alternative service providers for Starlink to be viable. Elon has said Starlink will serve the 3–4 percent hardest-to-reach customers. In addition to rural customers, it will presumably serve other niches like in-flight wifi on airplanes and Internet access for the crew on container ships.
Let’s call global telecommunications revenue $2.4 trillion. Assume Starlink can capture 3 percent of that. That is $72 billion per year in revenue, faaaaar more than SpaceX makes in launch. In 2019, the company had only $2 billion in revenue. Starlink is a money printer. And it makes you wonder, if SpaceX’s success so far has come on a budget of $2B in annual revenue, what would a $72B-per-year SpaceX do?
How about colonize Mars? I have a bet with Robin Hanson that a human will set foot on Mars by end of Q1 2030. I am not totally confident that this will happen (Robin gave me odds), but the scenario I think is most likely is the following: Starlink prints a lot of money, and SpaceX uses the money to pay for Mars colonization on Starship at a breakneck pace. That results in a human launch to Mars no later than January 2029, landing in September 2029. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell has said it will be a “major company fail” if humans are not flying on Starship (presumably just to LEO) by 2023. With Starlink revenue, SpaceX will be able to do the work on life support systems and mission planning to enable a human mission by 2029. NASA could be involved as a partner, but SpaceX would tolerate zero government obstacles.
Starship is also still in the running to be the landing vehicle for NASA’s Artemis missions. If it is not selected, that seems like a colossal error. To be sure, choosing Starship would represent a huge change of plans for NASA, which had been assuming a congressionally supported boondoggle relying on the Space Launch System, the Orion capsule, and a moon-orbiting Gateway. While Artemis’s goal is a human mission to the moon’s south pole by 2024, the schedule could easily slip. But by leveraging the new opportunities afforded by Starship, a permanent moon base by the end of the decade seems highly plausible.
With lower launch costs, what else is possible? Varda is a new company working on in-space manufacturing. Microgravity means that structures can be used that would collapse under their own weight on Earth. As a result, certain pharmaceuticals, fiber optics, semiconductor wafers, and nanotube materials can be manufactured in space that can’t be made on our planet. Lots of people want to bring manufacturing back to America, but putting manufacturing in orbit is much more exciting.
How about asteroid mining? I think this is still a ways off. There’s no question that it could be profitable someday. The street value of the materials on 16 Psyche back on Earth is $10 quintillion—even allowing for the inevitable hefty price slippage, space resource extraction could make a few trillionaires. I would love to be proven wrong, but I don’t think serious space mining will happen until the 2030s at the earliest. Again, however, cheap launch costs could be a game changer.
Information technology
Custom silicon is going to be huge. The rave reviews for Apple’s new custom system-on-a-chip platform demonstrate its inevitability. For machine learning, Cerebras has a full wafer-sized SoC. Tesla’s “full self-driving” computer likewise uses custom silicon. Almost all computer hardware—anything that has any scale to it—will move in this direction, because the performance benefits are so large. In a way, it’s a repetition of what happened before in semiconductors: individual transistors gave way to the integrated circuit. This change is simply taking integration another level further. Note: we lack the capability to manufacture these SoCs (at least good ones) in North America. Given their strategic importance, it may be worth remedying that.
The 2020s will be the decade that makes or breaks cryptocurrency. Well, nothing will ever break cryptocurrency—true believers will run the networks forever no matter what. But for cryptocurrency to have long-run value, I still hold that it needs to have mainstream uses. This means it needs to scale, it needs a good user experience, and normal people need to actually use it to transact. If it can’t reach that point by the end of the decade, I think it will have failed to have lived up to its promise. I am still cautiously optimistic. I think migration to proof-of-stake, lower transaction costs, more refined tools, and mature standards could lead to mainstreaming.
By the middle of the decade, augmented reality will be widely deployed, in the same way that smart watches are today. Glasses will be computing devices. Every big tech company has a glasses project at a relatively mature stage in the lab today. The need for the glasses to understand context could result in much smarter digital assistants than today’s Siri, Alexa, and so on.

The findings of a freight data sharing study, which involved trials with companies including Woolworths, Nestle and Toll Group, has outlined the opportunities for improvement in the sector, as well as identifying why supply chains are suffering.
The iMOVE Cooperative Research Centre study undertaken with the Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE) and GS1 Australia recently released its report, the findings of which will assist the Australian Government in setting up the National Freight Data Hub (NFDH).
The NFDH will collect and aggregate data to:
Give visibility to how the freight network is performingImprove infrastructure and transport network planningSupport operations through aligned data standards and provided timely insights into issues and bottlenecks
The iMOVE/BITRE study sought to test specific use cases to get a deeper insight into these issues and give the NFDH a head start in addressing freight supply chain problems faced by industry.
The study involved three parts: two pilot trials with industry operators including Nestle, Woolworths, Toll, and Infrabuild; and a third pilot working with global business communications standards giant and barcode inventor GS1 Australia dealing with data aggregation.
The data aggregation project involved creating methods and systems to collect and convert raw freight consignment message data into strategic-level data  ie. producing insightful information for governments and industry that can be used for infrastructure planning and policy development.
Using GS1’s electronic interchange systems, the data aggregation pilot was highly successful in showing the benefits that can be gained.
Importantly, it illustrated how aggregated (‘strategic-level’) outputs can be derived from raw freight consignment messages. These include freight volumes by mode and commodity for specified time periods; supply chain-specific freight volume metrics; and supply-chain and network performance metrics (e.g. travel times, and estimated arrival times etc.)
A statement from the report said that the data aggregation project results “demonstrate how operational data can be transformed into strategic data that can help inform infrastructure planning, network operations, corridor planning and freight policy”.
The pilot trials including Nestle, Woolworths, Toll, and Infrabuild sought to identify matching unique consignment information across partner supply chain management systems, and see how this could be shared on different systems in real-time.
Although the trials were cut short by COVID-19, the early findings revealed that real-time freight consignment data is not currently shared across the supply chain and supply chain operators’ noted this impacted their ability to respond to disruptions.
The report said, “The multiplicity of standards and systems in use across industry, made it very difficult for project participants to reconcile and match related consignment records across the different systems”.
The study uncovered, in some cases, the unavailability of useful information about freight consignments once they left the dispatch bay, with paper-based systems still widely used.
“As a result, the shipper typically had no visibility of delayed or late shipments, until queried by the customer, impacting the ability to respond to unanticipated disruptions in a timely and efficient manner,” the report stated.
“The inability to link information across supply chain partners can result in significant re-keying of the same information multiple times across the supply chain, increasing cost and reducing efficiency.
“Increasing digitalisation can assist improved visibility of freight consignments and interoperability between supply chain partners.
“It can also significantly reduce the administrative burden for small operators. Improved visibility can help improve predictability, efficiency, and productivity of the freight industry, and improve industry responsiveness to supply chain delays, bottlenecks or error.”
iMOVE Managing Director, Ian Christensen, called on industry to take bolder steps to embrace data and increase information sharing along supply chains, or risk being out-competed by overseas operators who are already reaping the efficiency benefits.
“If we don’t lift our game Australian productivity could fall further behind, and our competitiveness will be seriously undermined,” Mr Christensen said.
“Freight operations overseas are working vigorously to reduce ‘transactional friction’ along supply chains. 
“Australian businesses need to catch up and recognise the importance of sharing data to maintain the competitiveness of local supply chains.
“State and Federal governments in Australia are also focussed on achieving stronger supply chain performance. 
“Their interest is in making informed decisions on new infrastructure and better freight policy, and to do that they need a clear view of the overall picture. This is best achieved by aggregating (anonymised) real operational data from the freight industry itself.
“iMOVE wants to find ways for governments and businesses to work together to make this happen.”
In a statement following the report’s release, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, Michael McCormack, said the study will lead to improvements in getting goods to customers by improving access to real-time supply chain freight data.
“The report provides insights for governments and industry for infrastructure planning and delivery,” Mr McCormack said.
“It shows how increasing digitization can improve visibility of freight for supply chain partners to decrease unexpected delivery disruptions.
“The Australian Government has committed $8.5 million to fund projects such as these that are enhancing the collection of freight data across the nation and settle the design of a National Freight Data Hub.”
Assistant Minister for Road Safety and Freight Transport, Scott Buchholz, said the report could open the door to improved productivity and efficiency for the freight industry.
“The report noted sharing real-time freight data would mean our supply chain operators could respond to delays and errors quickly, which will help our truckies do their crucial job getting goods to businesses and consumers,” Mr Buchholz said.
“We want to ensure our freight is moving efficiently across the country, getting to our doors as smoothly as possible.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted more than ever the critical importance of our freight supply chains and all those involved.
“This study has given the Australian Government a deeper insight into ways we can improve our freight supply chains.”

Hidden in plain sight on an old government farm near downtown Ottawa is a 1,800-acre playground for tech entrepreneurs: a smart city called Area X.O.
While the name may evoke thoughts of alien investigations, Area X.O is all about business and innovation. Powered by its own super speed 5G wireless network with live input from traffic and aviation partners, this state-of-the-art smart city is bringing companies from around the world together to test technology that could revolutionize communities.
“This site gives us the opportunity to try new things, see what people want, test it out, and if it validates, we move forward,” Michael Tremblay, CEO of Invest Ottawa, told CTV News.
At the private compound, companies can develop and test out autonomous vehicles, drones, smart agriculture and even projects related to defence and security, all in a real-world setting. There are roadways, traffic lights and even a railway crossing.
According to their website, part of Area X.O’s vehicle testing facilities include the ability to simulate all four seasons, putting vehicles through temperatures ranging from -39 degrees Celsius to 39 degrees Celsius.
This week, the federal government announced it would be putting $7 million in funding towards Area X.O so that smaller businesses that normally can’t afford to use expensive technology in their development or testing of products can have an opportunity to work with those tools at Area X.O.
One of the projects tested at the facility is a mobile command unit which uses drones to locate missing people, and then sends an autonomous emergency vehicle automatically to their location.
Shawn Sparling, vice president of Enterprise and Public Sector at Nokia Canada, told CTV News that the 5G network allows “instantaneous communication from all the devices in the area,” making it a prime location to test tech that relies on wireless communication, such as this innovation in search and rescue.
Nokia is one of the founding partners of Area X.O.
“Nokia brings the communications piece, but we need small, medium, large companies to work with and bring solutions around the 4G, 5G networks, so we can address manufacturing search and rescue with their applications,” Sparling said. “This environment here allows us to work with them closely and do a lot of testing.”
From sensors that stop driverless cars when someone is in the crosswalk, to self-driving tractors, all these creations aim to make life safer and easier in a more connected world.
GPS Ontario, a company that works on implementing technological innovations into agriculture, is testing tractors that can function autonomously and more efficiently at Area X.O.
“One of the biggest issues we have in agriculture right now is actually getting skilled workforce,” he told CTV News. “Having the ability to have a tractor that knows where it needs to go and what it needs to be doing at the same time is going to give us that […] [ability to] put almost anybody in the tractor cab now and run the same accuracy as if the farm owner or farmer himself was in the tractor.”
He said that one of the big advantages of Area X.O is the telecommunications and tools already in place that allow them to do more testing than is possible on a regular farm.
These tractors will still have a driver in them for oversight, but less pressure is on the driver to do everything.
“The driver in the tractor literally has to say: ‘Yes, I would like you to turn,’ and the system’s preprogrammed, ready to go, to where it needs to be driving,” Wallace said.
They’re working on being able to send commands to an autonomous tractor that would allow it to make choices between types of fertilizer or split planter varieties, and are hoping that the efficiencies this technology could introduce might even make farming more environmentally friendly and more cost-effective for farmers.
With the government’s promised funding for Area X.O, 200 jobs will be created, adding to the 230 people who already work at the facility, helping to provide a glimpse into future uses of technology in Canada.

While 2020 was a successful year for Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically the subfields of Machine Learning (ML) that are Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning, there is one industry that is on the cusp of mass market adoption and that is autonomous vehicles.
While Tesla’s autopilot was first introduced in September 2014, it still does not qualify for full level 5 autonomous driving. Level 5 is defined as Full Driving Automation. Level 4 is defined as High Driving Automation, and the current version of Tesla autopilot would best be defined as Level 3 Conditional Driving Automation. This still requires the human to be alert to take control of the vehicle.
2020 Milestones
2020 was a hugely positive year for autonomous vehicles, since October 2020 Waymo has been enabling customers to hail driverless vehicles using a service called WAYMO ONE, and the feedback from riders has been overwhelmingly positive. There have been no reported incidents of dangerous driving, or even of strange errors.  To be specific WAYMO ONE is full level 5 autonomous driving. This service enables anyone in Metro Pheonix to download the Waymo App and hail a ride. This is no different than riding in an Uber or Lyft, with the primary difference being that there is no driver, and specifically there is no safety driver to take over should there be an issue.
Unlike Tesla, Waymo does take advantage of Lidar technology. The benefits of Lidar is it offers a 95 degree field of view versus traditional cameras that offer a 30 degree field of view. The downsides of Lidar is that it is more expensive than traditional cameras. Similar to any other new technology the more mass market adoption the more the cost of Lidar will drop due to economies of scale.
While Waymo has successfully deployed one of the first driverless ride sharing networks, other companies have also made significant progress in 2020 including Alibaba’s AutoX. This December they reported for the first time that the fleet of 25 autonomous vehicles in China’s Shenzhen city have no  accompanying safety drivers. Also reported were plans to within six months expand to 10 cities globally.
Another important milestone is Amazon purchasing Zoox for $1.2 billion earlier in 2020. Amazon stated that the two companies will work together to design autonomous ride-hailing vehicles from the ground up by prioritizing passengers’ needs first.
2021 Industry Projections
The news for 2021 is showing promise on the autonomous vehicle front, some major news includes Walmart announcing the start of truly driverless operations in their hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas beginning in 2021. This is after they had previously driven 70,000 operational miles in autonomous mode with a safety driver. To begin they plan on a driverless fleet on a specific route in Arkansas, and will then expand operations to a second location in Louisiana. It doesn’t take much forward thinking to realize that this will soon expand to the rest of the country, with the only probable hold back being local state and city regulations.
More important for mass market adoption has been the announcement that Tesla will release its ‘full self-driving’ feature as a subscription in early 2021.  The full self driving is still a very early beta that allows drivers to automatically handle city streets, traffic lights, roundabouts and street turns. From our impression it is a level 4 (High Driving Automation) technology that is close to level 5 (full driving automation).
Another example of a potential entrant in the space is GreenPower Motor Company Inc,  a leading manufacturer and distributor of zero emissions electric powered medium and heavy duty vehicles. They recently announced the delivery of the first fully autonomous EV Star to Jacksonville Transportation Authority (JTA) in collaboration with Perrone Robotics. Driving is slated to commence in early 2021.
Dangers of Level 4
Without a doubt driverless vehicles are far safer than human driven vehicles. Statistically speaking having a vehicle engaged on autopilot results in collisions at a far lower incidence than human operators. Tesla Autopilot Accidents are reported to be 1 out of 4,530,000 Miles driven; versus the US accidents Average: 1 out of 479,000 Miles driven.
Since autonomous vehicles use deep reinforcement learning and other proprietary machine learning technologies, the more miles driven, the more data that is collected and the more that the algorithm improves itself. Unlike humans who only learn from their own personal past experience, a Tesla is always learning. A Tesla may learn a new edge case in Wyoming, and apply the logic from that learned experience to a new encounter in Delaware. In other words, the more Teslas on the road, the more the AI advances at an exponential pace.
At this point we know that autonomous vehicles are safer, unlike humans they do not consume alcohol, they do not get angry or drowsy. The current danger is the transition period between an autopilot system disengaging and a human taking over the task of driving. And herein lies the danger of Level 4 autonomous driving, the fact that there is a human driver in the vehicle who with every update of the software is becoming more reliant on the AI, and more complacent with their responsibilities.  It is the human tendency to nod off, not pay attention, fall asleep, or be distracted that is the danger.
The current danger behind autonomous vehicles is the transition back and forth between AI and driver, this is why we will soon see an industry push for a rapid transition from level 4 to level 5 autonomy in order to improve road safety for everyone. The sooner this happens the better, after all why would any city choose to endanger passengers by having an on-board human driver, when an anto-pilot is so much safer and less temperamental?
Summary
Driverless vehicles will be more cost effective due to various converging technologies. A reduction in the number of drivers is the most obvious cost reduction, but there will be a reduction in insurance rates for companies. Enterprises will soon begin to demand reduced insurance premiums due to the huge safety benefits of having an autonomous vehicle. Cities will eventually also offer premium benefits to owners of autonomous vehicles, as every avoided collision, is one less potential hospital stay. This is especially the case in more socialist countries like Canada and European nations that offer free healthcare.
Eventually enterprises will rush to remove from the equation the largest liability in a fleet, the driver. With the driver gone, the AI can then navigate streets in the most energy efficient manner, with a significant reduction in accidents, and an improvement in delivery speed.
2021 should be an interesting transition year, Unite.AI looks forward to reporting on the future progress of this disruptive industry.

 As smart sensors are placed in billions of connected devices around the world, new IoT applications are generating massive streams of data that enable a world of opportunities. 
Consider the rise of smartwatches that allow people to track their fitness, monitor their sleeping patterns, measure their heart rate, and more. Think of a future where self-driving cars are able to collect, process, and store driving data at the edge to make road travel safer and more enjoyable.
As mobility and ways of working continues to be redefined, Khwaja Saifuddin, senior sales director, Middle East, Western Digital, highlights the top nine use cases of the IoT technologies.
Autonomous and connected vehicles
Down the road, vehicles might be able to reach Level 5 autonomy and drive themselves fully without human intervention. Today, however, car makers and automotive startups are working on getting level 2, 3, and 4 self-driving technology right. Cameras, radar, LIDAR and a host of other onboard sensors are being used to capture information about road conditions, inform appropriate driving actions, and potentially prevent accidents. To make this happen, nearly 1 terabyte of data will be stored onboard in the near-term, and this amount could balloon to 2+ terabytes in the next decade.
Yet, there’s more to the cars of tomorrow than just autonomous driving. Thanks to the Internet of Things, cars can communicate with each other, the road infrastructure, and, perhaps someday, even pedestrians by using “vehicle-to-everything” or “V2X” technology. Fleets of autonomous vehicles could be managed through this type of communication, making travel faster and safer. Onboard the car, IoT-enabled devices could improve the engine diagnostics, GPS data, and infotainment system.
Smart security for businesses and homes
Historically, security systems often simply used a low-resolution camera to passively capture video. This trend held whether at private residences or commercial properties. Now, smart security systems are being purpose-built to capture, store, and analyse continuous video streams. On top of the 4K video captured by high-resolution cameras, these systems can use an analytics layer with machine learning software to carry out pattern recognition and motion detection. For public transportation providers and venue managers, these real-time insights play a meaningful role in public safety – thanks to robust storage and compute at the device-level.
Connecting your home to the Internet (of Things)
What if your home could be mostly automated? That’s the direction that connected home technology is headed in this IoT use case. Smart speakers function like a central command, enabling your household electronics to perform a variety of voice-activated functions. You could, for example, instruct your TV to stream the latest episode of your favorite show while dimming the living room lights and setting the thermostat to a cozy temperature. This approach stretches even further by integrating refrigerators, washers, dryers, and more. The goal is to provide control for most or all of a home’s systems – including energy, climate, entertainment, appliances, and home security – through a connected network of devices, sensors, tools and platforms.
Smartwatches, fitness trackers, and other wearables
Thanks to an influx of new personal devices, the wearables market is thriving. In fact, a recent report predicts that this industry will cross over $27 billion and 233 million units sold annually by the year 2022. This global adoption is due in large part to smartwatches, which are expected to make up over half of all wearables sold in the coming years. Consumers are looking for seamless connection and interaction between their smartphones and smartwatches to track, manage, and secure their data — especially sensitive health data. At the same time, industry analysts are forecasting flat-to-declining sales for fitness trackers – possibly due to a perceived lack of features and inability to sync with existing smartphones.
But, technological innovation won’t just come on the wrist. A new subcategory known as “hearables” could disrupt the wearables industry, using voice-activated, connected headphones and earphones. With more headset makers ditching the headphone jack, these types of devices are expected to become commonplace in the future. Another opportunity is in portable medical devices that monitor blood pressure and heart rate, as well as alert ambulance dispatchers during a medical emergency.
Machine-to-machine (M2M) connected devices
Today’s factories are using IoT-enabled machines to work smarter, not harder. By equipping machines with sensors, factory managers can more accurately map machine workloads, inputs, and outputs. They can also more closely track machine wear-and-tear, which leads to maintenance that is predictive rather than reactive and improves lifespan. With these features, factories are increasingly becoming automated, thanks to the wave of Industry 4.0. M2M devices use embedded and removable flash solutions to aggregate data into a single stream at the edge. This gateway is used to monitor and react to changing conditions on the factory floor. At the same time, unused data is passed on to the central cloud or data center for further processing.
Supply chains of the future
Another IoT use case is in supply chains, which are increasingly global and complex. Customer requirements evolve rapidly, products have to be procured, shipping and delivery routes have to be coordinated – you get the picture. In response, companies are creating connected enterprise systems and using data modeling as a key part of a broader data management strategy. Low-power IoT devices are also being used to track assets throughout the supply chain, and monitor product quality such as temperature, vibration and container openings. By using IoT-enabled devices and transportation routes, further improvements can be made to route planning by collecting in-transit, supply chain data.
Drones for industrial and search and rescue operations
For cinematographers and photographers, drones have helped record stunning landscapes previously unavailable to visual artists. But, these flying devices aren’t just used for this purpose. Oil rig workers are using drones to complete full rig inspections quicker, without sacrificing worker safety or production downtime. Ecommerce companies are looking into drone delivery of their buyers’ goods to their front doorstep. Even nonprofits are making use of drones to monitor deforestation in environmentally-fragile communities.
Outside of commercial uses, drones are serving the public good in search and rescue missions. These machines are helping search and rescue teams locate victims more quickly, evaluate the status of victims, and map the right path for rescue missions. In dangerous mountain rescues, successful drone operations require high performance and high capacity data storage. Read our latest white paper about how reliable storage makes a difference in life-threatening emergencies.
Smart cities: Energy, transportation, parking and more
One of the most promising IoT use cases is in creating smarter, more efficient cities. Public energy grids can be optimised to balance workloads, predict energy surges, and distribute energy more equitably to customers. The same goes for transportation systems in dense, urban environments. Traffic lights could be synced using IoT to adapt to traffic conditions in real-time. During an emergency, first responders can communicate with traffic lights to synchronise and provide direct access to critical locations. Another possibility is to digitally track parking, so that available spaces are automatically sent as push notifications to drivers looking for a place to park.
Farm to tech to table
Today’s farmers are bringing the power of IoT to streamline their operations. As the use of free-range livestock becomes widely adopted, connected technology can track animals as they graze in open pastures. Smart sensors placed in irrigation systems can reduce water consumption to create just the right moisture level in soil for a given crop. It’s even being used to watch over factors such as humidity and temperature in composting. Additionally, farmers can keep tabs on their equipment, mapping out where each item is, tracking its performance, and carrying out predictive maintenance. Outside of traditional farms, wine producers are using IoT to understand grapevine health and sugar levels in grapes.
Western Digital offers an extensive portfolio of products from devices to systems and platforms designed to enable the power and possibilities of data driven by IoT and edge computing.
Object storage solutions built on Western Digital Ultrastar platforms, including the Ultrastar Data60 Hybrid Storage Platform and the Ultrastar Data102 Hybrid Storage Platform, are designed to handle massive amounts of data generated by IoT. The company also offers adaptive solutions to handle everything from small footprint storage for the application stack of smart sensors to an Edge gateway server to facilitate the advancements in M2M connected devices. As a trusted partner for industrial IoT, the Ultrastar NVMe Series, and Ultrastar SATA Series SSD deliver the performance necessary to minimise latency and maximise responsiveness.

Waymo has partnered with one of the world’s largest truck manufacturers to install its fully autonomous self-driving technology into semi-trailer trucks on American roads.
Daimler is the oldest name in German automotive engineering, and its US-based trucking arm Daimler Trucks said on Tuesday that it’s collaborating with Waymo on its Freightliner Cascadia line of big rigs. Last year, the Euro giant invested in Torc Robotics, a self-driving startup based in Virginia that’s more oriented towards the defense industry than Waymo is.
“In recent years, we have achieved significant progress on our global roadmap to bringing series-produced highly automated trucks to the road,” said Martin Daum, chairman of the board of management of Daimler Truck AG.
“With our strategic partnership with Waymo as the leader in autonomous driving, we are taking another important step towards that goal. This partnership complements Daimler Trucks’ dual strategy approach, of working with two strong partners to deliver autonomous L4 solutions that are seamlessly integrated with our best-in-class trucks, to our customers.”
The partnership aims to build level-four automated trucks, which would use AI to perform all the necessary functions needed to drive autonomously for a whole trip, theoretically. It’ll still need a human driver to take over when necessary, for safety and regulatory reasons.
Neither company announced a strict deadline for when autonomous convoys of trucks expect to hit the roads. Waymo only said its self-driving software would be rolling out to US customers “in the coming years”.
“At Waymo, we’re developing a fully autonomous L4 stack, which means the Waymo Driver is responsible for the entire driving task at all times, with no human required in the loop,” a spokesperson told The Register.
“Our Driver-as-a-Service model will first be focused on highway driving and also handle driving on a limited amount of surface streets to depots, whether that’s an LTL terminal or warehouse or distribution center.” LTL stands for “less-than-truckload shipping” and describes small freight carriers that hold over 150lb (68kg) of goods.
The Alphabet-owned Google spin-off has entered into multiple partnerships with automakers, mostly dealing with smaller cars rather than trucks. It has been testing its self-driving software in trucks for a while, however. Waymo has been testing bulkier delivery trucks in highways across California, Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico since 2017.

This peak holiday season will be unlike any before, and brands must adapt accordingly. These unusual circumstances need to be met with creative solutions to ensure customer experiences do not skip a beat.
Among the many issues plaguing retailers this peak holiday season is the conundrum of last-mile delivery. With expected carrier delays due to increased ecommerce volume and surging transportation costs, retail brands must find a strategy to remedy this problem.
Aside from ordering an item online, delivery is the only other direct touchpoint a consumer will have with your brand. Variables such as carrier delays or transportation costs will be associated with your company if they negatively impact shoppers this holiday season. In this article, I will walk through a few ways to avoid this scenario by looking at alternative last-mile delivery options that will keep both consumers and brands happy.
Shortened Supply Chain: Pop-Ups or Micro Fulfillment
By reducing transit time for goods as much as possible, brands can remove much of the uncertainty involved in last mile delivery. This helps to solve two big problems many brands are facing this peak holiday season: Shipping delays and increased transportation costs.
With expected ecommerce volume at three times normal capacity, carriers are expected to experience delays in delivery times. Additionally, many are adding holiday surcharges based on distance, volume and proximity to the holidays.
To avoid these negative scenarios, retail brands should embrace alternative options like micro-fulfillment. This shortens the supply chain by dispersing product across various micro or pop-up distribution centers. Thus, transportation distances and shipping costs are decreased. Brands can leverage their existing infrastructure in new ways while delivering an optimal fulfillment experience for the holidays. This is crucial as over 700 million holiday packages are at risk of not arriving on time, according to Salesforce.
A New Application for the Gig Economy
Another solution this holiday season is tapping into the gig economy. Ridesharing platforms like Uber and Lyft, as well as food delivery apps DoorDash and Postmates, have risen as viable solutions to the last-mile delivery dilemma.
Many of these platforms already have a robust food delivery complement, so applying the same strategy to ecommerce fulfillment is a natural progression based on current market demands. This is a trend to watch as this holiday season will serve as a great litmus test for the role of the gig economy in last-mile delivery moving forward.
Shoppers should not be surprised if their packages are dropped off by a ridesharing platform as opposed to the typical carrier truck. The gig economy offers a more agile delivery solution and helps to localize the supply chain even further.
Expanding BOPIS and Curbside Capabilities
For shoppers who are disappointed in recent brick-and-mortar retail closings, the next best thing is a great experience with Buy Online, Pickup in Store (BOPIS). Shoring up curbside pickup should be a key priority for brands this peak holiday season and into 2021.
This option is safe for consumers and eliminates issues with transportation delays and surcharges. However, omnichannel brands must streamline their supply chains to make expanding curbside a viable plan. This includes ensuring products are dispersed proportionately across geographies and offering inventory transparency to shoppers across sales channels. This creates an urgency to buy and also lets consumers know when they can pick up items at various locations nearest to them.
As we dive further into the 2020 holidays, retailers will be constantly faced with new challenges. By tapping into alternative fulfillment options, you can offset some of these variables and in turn deliver great experiences for shoppers. Especially this year, the success of your last-mile delivery is critical to winning during peak holiday season, so you can’t afford to leave anything to chance.

The autonomous mobility industry is tackling part of the last-mile problem that many commuters encounter when using public transportation by replacing large, diesel buses with a fleet of electric, self-driving shuttle buses that transport small groups of people along defined and planned routes. Autonomous shuttles could be a key element that connects the public transportation systems to reduce private car ownership in the future. The autonomous shuttle total market size will be over $18 billion by 2040, according to IDTechEx’s report “Robot Shuttles and Autonomous Buses 2020-2040.”
What are autonomous shuttles?
Autonomous shuttles are upright, boxy, 8-20 person vehicles that are symmetrical so they never do a U-turn. Small footprint, all-round vision, large doors, quiet, zero-emission, they can go indoors and over piazzas and roads and are able to perform many different tasks even in one day. Primarily intended for intensive urban use, they are gated to never exceed a determined speed, typically in the range 50kmph – 60kmph.It all adds up to a new form of transport backed by both huge companies like Toyota and Baidu and start-ups alike. Their trials explore many possible applications, from empowering the poor and disabled, to viably filling in gaps in the transportation network and replacing very underutilized vehicles such as school buses and private cars, reducing congestion and cost. In IDTechEx’s new report “Electric, Hybrid and Fuel Cell Buses 2021-2040” the major players developing autonomous shuttles are profiled. We summarise a selection of these companies below. While true level 4 autonomy does not currently exist, most companies discussed are at “level 4” in geofenced or controlled areas. 
NAVYA
NAVYA is a French company founded in 2014 with more than 270 employees in France and the US. The company filed for IPO in Euronext Paris in July 2018 with 80 million euro ($94 million) financing and the company achieved 19 million euro ($22 million) revenues in 2018. The AUTONOM SHUTTLE, launched in 2015, is designed for a low-speed environment where there is a high frequency of travel. Currently, it is still operated at Level 3 autonomy where on-board safety operators are required. The shuttle is dedicated to the first and last-mile transportation and can carry up to 15 people. The shuttle is suitable for underserved areas where full-sized buses might not be justified from a ridership standpoint, or areas that are too tight to get around. The shuttles can operate on open roads in cities or private sites such as campuses, business parks, airports, industrial parks and hospitals – anywhere where people are taking lots of trips from half a mile up to two miles. NAVYA’s strategy is to build small autonomous shuttles with a $300,000+ price that can be amortized over time by municipalities, campuses and large corporate parks working on smart city projects.
EasyMile
EasyMile is a French high-tech start-up founded in 2014 with over 180 employees. The main product, EZ10, was designed from the ground for autonomous driving (no steering wheel). The EZ10 was launched in 2015 and 110 units have been sold to date. The company is generating some revenues (relatively small) from selling the shuttles. Apart from selling the EZ10 shuttles, the company also licenses its in-house autonomous driving software to other companies.
2getthere
2getthere is a spin-off company of Frog Navigation Systems, which was founded in 1984 to deliver automated guided vehicles (AGVs) to factories. The company became an independent company focused on autonomous vehicles for passenger transport in 2007, with a HQ in the Netherlands and was acquired by ZF Group, a German auto parts maker, in March 2019, which is one of the largest automotive suppliers. Its business model is to sell the complete transportation system: vehicles and operation systems including a supervision system for fleet management, passenger interface, charging infrastructure and communication infrastructure.
Baidu
The Chinese tech giant Baidu was founded in 2000 and specializes in internet-related services and products, and AI. The company started development of autonomous vehicles in 2013. The company has negotiated 50 partners to sign up for the development and purchase of the new autonomous buses Apolong. The volume production of the autonomous minibus Apolong is in partnership with Chinese vehicle manufacturer King Long who designs and manufactures the vehicle. In July 2018, Baidu announced its 100th Apolong, marking its ability to commercialize its autonomous shuttle buses.
Yutong
Yutong is a Chinese manufacturer of commercial vehicles, especially electric buses, headquartered in Zhengzhou, Henan. As of 2016, it was the largest bus manufacturer in the world by sales volume. Yutong showcased their pure electric shuttle in March 2019 during a forum in Hainan, China, transporting attendees at the conference venue. 
The autonomous shuttle integrates the U-Drive AI platform developed by UISEE, which uses sensor fusion and deep learning algorithms as well as a cloud-based vehicle management system. The 5m-long shuttle has 8 seats and can go up to 40km/h in a closed environment. The shuttle is equipped with a set of sensors including 3 lidars, radars, cameras and ultrasonics. In May 2019, Yutong started a pilot project on 5G intelligent transportation, running 5 shuttles on an island district in Zhengzhou in collaboration with China Unicom and China Mobile. The tested district is covered with 5G and has a dedicated lane for autonomous shuttles.

Autonomous, or self-driving cars will make driving safer, smarter and more efficient. Equipped with Internet connections, often wireless local area networks, self-driving cars will be able to speak to each other and the environment around them.
One feature allows the cars to keep their distance and synchronise braking to avoid accidents. Autonomous cars will include features such as lane assist, collision avoidance and automatic calls to emergency services to create a safer driving experience. Some automotive brands are taking automation a step further, innovating to enable vehicles to communicate with nearby infrastructure and even pedestrians, adding a new dimension to how automation can benefit society.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) believes that the right technology infrastructure is critical for the production of these vehicles, which require high-performance computing capacity, seamless cybersecurity and the ability to manage vast data sets. Here are some of the key reasons why many organisations are turning to the cloud to develop and deploy autonomous cars at scale:
Training and testing
Autonomous cars strive to create vehicles that operate more safely than humans. Delivering on this ambition requires extensive modelling and testing. The ability to collect, store and manage data is critical, as are advanced Machine Learning techniques.
Toyota Research Institute (TRI) believes that accurately training autonomous cars requires trillions of miles of testing. To deliver on this, it has a fleet of test cars equipped with Light Direction and Ranging (Lidar) Sensors to record data, collecting terabytes of data every day, needing quick retrieval and analyses. 
TRI uses AWS to manage this data and access the processing power required to train Machine Learning models quickly. Using cloud infrastructure, it has gained the ability to spin up compute and storage resources on demand and blend these with management and orchestration services. TRI now retrains vehicle models, increases accuracy and introduces new features faster. By following similar models, more automotive businesses will accelerate the development of safer cars.
Edging forward
Enabling autonomous cars to make rapid, data-driven decisions will make our roads safer. These machines need backing by reliable infrastructure with low latency and high availability. They also need to analyze information in real time, including data on road conditions, weather and the behavior of other vehicles. Applying AI allows the car to react swiftly and safely to road conditions.
Edge Computing allows this core in-car technology to perform its in-car data crunching. When a second of lag can make the difference between a safe or dangerous response, autonomous vehicles do not have the luxury of waiting for data processing in the cloud. Therefore, organisations need to look for cloud providers with integrated edge solutions. These allow analysis of mission-critical data at the source and reducing the cost of transmitting additional data to the cloud.
Security in the cloud
Cybersecurity is important when developing safety-focused autonomous cars. Each vehicle becomes a new endpoint which must be secured. Protection from hackers and malware must be a top priority to ensure they cannot gain access to driving controls or the data that runs through each vehicle.
Autonomous car producers are turning to the cloud in order to support and run connected cars. AWS delivers automated security services which apply Machine Learning to proactively manage tasks including security assessments, threat detection and policy management. By having security baked in, manufacturers can be confident that they have the solutions in place to detect new and emerging vulnerabilities and threats which will reduce harm to drivers and lower the risk of a breach.
Autonomous cars are our future; however to drive adoption, manufacturers must ensure they are secure and supported by robust infrastructure. With the right cloud infrastructure, organisations are able to focus their resources on building differentiated automotive experiences, rather than managing IT infrastructure.

When we talk about the future of logistics, it is all pertains to the speed of responding to market changes and staying ahead of the demand curve by leveraging operational responsiveness.
By Abhik Mitra
In the past decade, shopping has evolved greatly for consumers over the years as the online experience has gone through several stages of improvements.  India’s e-commerce growth has soared and continues to do so, at an annual rate of 51 per cent, which is also the highest for any region in the world. The market will stand at $200 billion by 2026, and the pandemic outbreak has accelerated it. The massive growth of e-commerce, new consumption patterns, and retail models have impacted businesses in an unprecedented way. Faster and shorter demand cycles create a strong need for flexibility and agility in e-commerce logistics.
Same or next-day delivery or even four-hour express delivery options are business as usual today. This complexity and need for real-time fulfillment call for greater efficiency, speed, and accuracy, and on a larger scale. While e-commerce has made the life of consumers extremely convenient, the competition to deliver goods to consumers at a quicker pace has grown immensely. While it’s economical to transport cargo, the cost of operation tends to shoot up to fulfill such express deliveries every day across a million destinations. Conditioned to use traditional systems, responding to such changes will then be a challenge for e-commerce players. This further means high capital investments and long gestation periods while the operations continued to grapple with the onslaught of the parcel growth.
The current scenario has put a spotlight to improve last-mile logistics and modify supply chains to cater to these complexities. E-commerce companies have realized this and have developed a targeted approach to compete effectively. They are now deploying advanced technologies to strike the right balance between customers’ delivery expectations and sustaining their own profitability.
In the last few years, e-commerce logistics has evolved. Companies across the globe have seen a massive demand in these technologies, to match the dramatic evolution – in terms of volumes and value. Whether it is autonomous vehicles, drones, or GPS-monitored robots that are being developed for last-mile deliveries in the cities or inhouse robotics and automation making warehouse hubs advanced, the scenario is changing.
 There is the use of inbuilt RFID, GPS, and IoT, and telematics is being used for tracking inventory on the move. With the continual growth of e-commerce and deliveries becoming the norm, the pressure on supply chains is propelling the e-commerce logistics managers to adopt new solutions to enhance business agility and growth.
Ecommerce logistics will emerge as a massive market opportunity, for new innovation and growth. As the pandemic has made it more evident, our dependence on e-commerce will only grow, and the avenues in this space will expand. If e-commerce needs to grow in India, the successful businesses of the future will need to be swift and agile enough to take advantage of technologies –to the accelerated change to help deliver millions of parcels every day.
When we talk about the future of logistics, it is all pertains to the speed of responding to market changes and staying ahead of the demand curve by leveraging operational responsiveness. To exploit market responsiveness as a strategy, it will become imperative to optimize logistics and supply chain mechanisms. 
With the backdrop of Industry 4.0, digitization and evolution of customer behavior, e-commerce, and supply chain evolution have a long way to go. With the infiltration of technology, e-commerce logistics will transform from what it is today. It is already transforming and the next decade. Technology will play this role – to drive more agility, productivity, and the best customer experience. It is only onwards and upwards for everyone to witness how our home deliveries become innovative!

Autonomous vehicles have been on a path to widespread availability and adoption for some time. But this technology is now moving forward much faster than most people realize.
Both Tesla and General Motors this fall made news with their fully autonomous vehicle efforts. Tesla CEO Elon Musk in September said the test version of its fully self-driving Autopilot system would be released in “a month or so.” Less than a month later, Tesla revealed plans to offer a limited number of drivers a beta of this capability. Around the same time, GM announced plans to launch a test of unmanned autonomous vehicles by the end of this year in San Francisco.
Meanwhile, Google Waymo and Volkswagen are moving ahead with self-driving commercial truck efforts. Some companies are working on using automated follower trucks in the platooning of multiple trucks, too. This can entail having a human at the wheel of the lead truck only. Peloton Technology and Locomation expect automated following to scale quickly and more broadly.
The autonomous vehicle will be just as disruptive as the horseless carriage
The future of the autonomous vehicle is now. And I believe that this new generation of vehicle will be as disruptive today as the first horseless carriages were in the horse-and-buggy era.
I know about this topic because I’m an automotive historian, specializing in the 1886-1913 period. I’ve written several articles for collector car magazines. And I’ve read almost every book ever written on how disruptive motorized vehicles were. And I expect this to happen again.- Advertisement –
So, fasten your seatbelts because big change is on the way. I believe that in about 20 years non-autonomous cars will be outlawed. If people like me want to drive their classic cars, they’re going to have to put those vehicles on trailers, take them to tracks, and drive them there.
This is happening whether we like it or not – and will drive widespread change
I invested $100 to reserve a Tesla Cyber Truck with a fully autonomous system. But some people say they’ll never use an autonomous vehicle. But I truly believe that we will not have a choice in the matter at some point in the not-too-distant future. I say that because if every car on the road can communicate with the other vehicles, the propensity for accidents is going to be greatly reduced because it removes that human factor of the distracted driver.
Autonomous cars will also improve traffic flow. That could create efficiencies in road construction. In Los Angeles we have roads that are 16 lanes wide, and that’s still not enough.
And in the very near future, we will not own cars, we will subscribe to them. There are already companies offering vehicle subscriptions, including a business called Cocoon. Today we have to get the car. With autonomous vehicles, we’ll be able to summon a car, and it will come to us.
The move to subscriptions will impact our homes and yards as well. We won’t need big garages, so we’ll be able to use that space for extra rooms. We won’t necessarily even need driveways.
Autonomous vehicles need to be safe and secure regardless of class
The way government and industry rate and regulate vehicle safety will also need to change.
What if someone asked you: What is the safest car in America? You can’t answer that because it’s a trick question. The reason it’s a trick question is because safety is dependent on class. If you want the safest car in America, you’re going have to buy something like a Mercedes SUV. But most people can’t afford that. So, the safety commission provides safety rankings by class.
However, when it comes to the autonomous vehicles, every vehicle must have the exact same safety or security protocol to be successful. This is the reality regardless of whether the vehicle is a Toyota Tercel, or some other subcompact car, or the most expensive Mercedes.
Yet there’s no way that automakers can rely on consumers to keep in-car security systems current. It’s simple to put gas in a car, but people still run out of gas. Imagine what will happen when people get reports that they need to update security certificates in their cars and that if they don’t those vehicles are no longer secure. Are they all going to immediately drive to their dealership to have that security certificate updated? It’s just not going to happen. It is for this reason that consumers won’t purchase cars and the responsibility for maintaining the security will fall to subscription fleet operators.
The rise of driverless vehicles is converging safety and security
Autonomous vehicles are changing how we need to think about and address safety and security. Today there’s a big difference between safety and security. But in the coming era of autonomous vehicles, there will be no difference between the two.
Now the focus is on employing physical measures like airbags, crumple zones and seat belts to address safety. All vehicle safety features are based on the survivability of an accident, not intentional harm. No one ever thinks about security of a car, short of a car getting stolen.
But as autonomous vehicles become mainstream, electronic security becomes more important.
In a scene in “The Fate of the Furious” movie, Charlize Theron says “make it rain.” This prompts her techie coworkers in the room to remotely control vehicles in a parking garage. They use this control to drive those cars off the edge of the parking garage into a heap on the street below. If this were possible, that would be the end of the autonomous vehicle market altogether.
The public will accept accidents, such as an autonomous car running a stop light. But we will not, as a society, accept situations in which people intentionally run cars into walls or off cliffs or buildings. That’s why the security of fully autonomous vehicles is of paramount importance.
Public key infrastructure and hardware security modules can provide the needed protection
Automakers, component makers and security companies like us are already working on this. In fact, our work on security for autonomous vehicles has been in development for a long time.
The automotive industry has selected public key infrastructure (PKI) to secure autonomous vehicles. PKI, a proven way to secure digital systems, provides security using a pair of cryptographic keys. Public and private keys work together to secure the manufacturing and updates to cars and their components. But it is the private key that acts as the PKI root of trust.
In the case of autonomous vehicles, the private key lives in the car or with the manufacturer. If a hacker compromises the private key, that hacker can gain control of the car and override its programming. So, it’s important to keep the private key safe and secure at all costs.
You could store the private key in an application server. But that’s dangerous because perimeter security is your only safeguard, and hackers frequently breech “secure” perimeters.
Hardware security modules (HSMs), used during the manufacturing process and maintained by the manufacturer throughout the cars’ lifecycle, are a more effective way to secure PKI systems and keys. HSMs are specialized appliances that hold and secure cryptographic keys. They are widely used and serve as the ultimate root of trust for a range of applications and systems. Without an HSM, cryptographic keys are at high risk of compromise. This a large and growing problem since encryption keys are going to be in every car going forward. And it’s why using HSMs for autonomous vehicle security infrastructure should become an industry standard.
HSMs may seem a small detail, but going without them can have big repercussions
I see the cryptographic key as akin to the horseshoe nail. If you’re not securing that one little piece, you could run the risk of everything else getting compromised. And that risk is only growing as time progresses since computer systems are becoming faster and their ability to crack crypto is getting stronger. But if you are safeguarding your systems using PKI and HSMs, you can keep those systems, autonomous cars, and the people who use them safe and secure.

Autonomous vehicles are one of the most talked-about technological breakthroughs of the past decade. But as we approach the end of another year of testing issues and minimal developments within the industry, is it fair to say that the self-driving car’s rollout is stalling? 
In October 2020, Tesla grabbed the world’s attention with the arrival of its ‘Full Self Driving’ software for car owners to allow drivers to park, stay in a lane at cruising speed automatically, and stop at red lights. The unveiling was supposed to represent a significant step towards fully self-driving technology.What’s holding autonomous vehicles back? Before entering the market, self-driving cars will have to hurdle many issues, such as cybersecurity. || #IoTForAll #IoTClick To Tweet
However, according to Fortune, there are fears that the name ‘Full Self Driving’ may be misleading to some drivers, who could mistakenly assume that their car needs no supervision. Regulators have warned users to monitor the technology closely and “take action to protect the public against unreasonable safety risks”.
According to the chart published in Medium in 2018, 2020 was the year in which fully autonomous vehicles began to enter the market. However, by industry standards, even Tesla’s Full Self Driving software can only be considered an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). 
So what’s holding autonomous vehicles back? Let’s take a deeper look at some of the more significant issues that self-driving cars need to hurdle before entering the market.
The Fallacy of Machines Thinking Like Humans
One of the biggest issues to overcome is that, despite huge advancements in IoT technology, computers are a long way from possessing humans’ levels of intelligence. 
Of course, when it comes to individual tasks like identifying objects in pictures or following simple commands in a static environment, machines can far outperform humans. Still, many of these skills aren’t applicable in a more general situation. 
While the act of driving a car and understanding when red lights appear may be achieved by simple machines, the sheer volume of variables that occur during driving means that machines will be required to obtain huge levels of intelligence and adaptability. 
In a 2017 essay, leading robotics and artificial intelligence researcher, Rodney Brooks, stated that autonomous vehicles were not viable in the short-term due to the number of ‘edge cases’ that present themselves while driving. This refers to how often unusual events occur – such as the poor driving of others, obstacles on the road, and misleading road markings. 
While humans are naturally capable of reacting to unusual events and making swift adjustments, machines can struggle to understand how to adapt their actions to respond in the right way to the road in front of them, for instance. 
Obstacles to Sensors
Autonomous vehicles use multiple sensors to interact with the environment around them. This helps to detect objects like pedestrians, other vehicles android signs. Cameras can also help the car view objects and understand the distance between the vehicle and anything in its path. Radars can also chart the speed and direction of other vehicles and objects. 
These sensors provide feedback to the car’s control system to advise where to steer or stop. Fully autonomous cars require a wide range of sensors that can detect objects with accuracy while quickly determining their distance and speed in every possible condition to ensure safety at all times. 
However, factors like bad weather, dense traffic, weathered road signs, or damaged markings can significantly impact sensors’ capabilities. 
For truly autonomous vehicles to work, the sensors used need to be highly adaptive and strong enough to understand signals in the worst conditions in a range of environments. Given that accidents have occurred with Tesla models where cars have hit parked vehicles, it shows that there’s still some way to go in developing reliable autonomous sensors.
Cybersecurity Fears
There may be widespread concerns about the safety of autonomous vehicles in technical understanding and reacting to obstacles. Still, there’s also a significant danger that the interconnected vehicles could become the victim of cyberattacks.

Terms and Conditions
Transportation reporter Christian Wolmar reported that widespread hackings have happened “in other areas of computing, such as the big-data hacks and security lapses, and it will happen in relation to autonomous cars.” 
Given the dangers associated with a vehicle that’s been compromised by a hacker, any security issues within the firmware of cars will see widespread disruption occur as a result––making it extremely difficult to see the rollout of autonomous vehicles before rigorous tests are conducted. 
Complexity of Insurance
There’s a whole host of financial issues attached to the rollout of autonomous vehicles. The matter of insurance and where the responsibility lies should accidents occur, a big hurdle to overcome. 
Traditionally, drivers pay insurance for their cars to cover any accidents taking place. Still, when a vehicle is entirely autonomous, there’s no reason for an owner to pay out when it’s likely to be the fault of the vehicle itself. 
The arrival of self-driving cars will spark a reformation of how owners pay for their cars. If insurance falls on the manufacturer, it could see the costs of vehicles rising further. In a world that’s become more accustomed to purchasing vehicles on HP or PCP finance, the complexity of ownership could be wholly off-putting for prospective buyers. 
That said, there’s little doubting that autonomous vehicles will have a role to play in the future of motoring. Whether the technology and its complicated connotations develop to the point where we could see private vehicles hitting the roads by the end of the decade, or more likely that way see some form of light delivery vehicles rolled out, it’s a testament to interconnectivity and the potential for innovation in the industry.

As the coronavirus continues to spread throughout the world, more and more people are staying home in an effort to contain the outbreak. With brick-and-mortar stores shutting down and people being asked to remain indoors, individuals are increasingly resorting to online deliveries.
A recent analysis conducted by Adobe shows that e-commerce purchases of hand sanitizers, gloves, masks and antibacterial sprays surged by 817% during the month of February 2020, and it’s likely that other product categories will follow suit.
To meet new demands brought on by the virus, retailers need to make sure they’re delivering a superior customer experience. It will be defined by proactive communication about the status of shipments, as well as fast delivery.
Using sensors enabled by the internet of things (IoT), retailers can keep tabs on shipment whereabouts and conditions, enabling proactive communications to customers about the status of their orders. Here’s how IoT can aid in tracking and monitoring efforts during this critical time.
Accurate Location Tracking
Because shipments become more critical as people stay home to avoid the virus, customer expectations of on-time delivery are even higher than before. By turning to IoT-enabled devices, organizations can secure insight into shipment whereabouts that will help them keep customers up to date on delivery estimates and periodic location updates as they await their packages.
Data collected by IoT devices can also empower retailers to optimize shipment routes for faster delivery, improving operations and, again, bolstering the customer experience. Identifying warehouse delays, addressing weak links in the supply chain, and driving overall efficiencies are additional benefits of deploying IoT.
With the virus spreading, such information could become lifesaving. Perhaps a supplier notices that on a particular route, its shipments are hitting a snag in the supply chain, causing a delivery delay. By applying machine-learning techniques to data collected using IoT devices, the supplier can avoid that route moving forward, and accelerate the delivery of critical items such as gloves and face masks.
Conditions Monitoring
In addition to tracking shipment location, container conditions must be considered. By collecting, computing and delivering updates on the environmental state of containers, IoT-enabled sensors can instill confidence that the enclosed goods are properly maintained.
This is especially important for providers of perishable or fragile items, as containers move from supplier to distributor to customer. For instance, the failure of a shipment containing pharmaceuticals or food to maintain proper temperature throughout its journey could lead to serious public health issues. Beyond tarnishing the seller’s brand reputation, it can cause potential health risks to customers who may have been depending on goods or medicine to get them through a shelter-in-place.
With IoT-enabled sensors, retailers can get ahead of these issues by securing continuous updates on container conditions, including temperature. Companies can take action to remedy any issues immediately, as well as detect where there are likely to be more broken processes down the road.
Global Connectivity
Tracking and monitoring containers can only be accomplished if IoT devices are connected to a global network and can deliver the insights needed to help retailers and customers stay up to date.
Organizations should consider turning to a 0G network to provide them with global connectivity. A 0G network is a low-power wide-area network that can transfer small amounts of data across long ranges. It differs from other connectivity options in that it transmits data — pertaining to location or temperature, for example — at a lower cost than that of traditional IoT providers, but without sacrificing quality. In addition, because the device consumes smaller amounts of power, battery life is longer and more predictable. This means IoT-enabled devices won’t die during the shipment journey across the globe, so retailers can secure and communicate real-time updates.
With greater visibility up and down the supply chain, organizations can set themselves on the path to operational efficiency, superior customer experiences, and a healthy bottom line. Whether retailers are adjusting to evolving demands stemming from the coronavirus, or trying to maintain their competitive standing, IoT can provide the insights needed to adjust course, while still delivering exceptional service at an affordable price.

 Radical transparency is the key to building lasting customer relationships that result in satisfaction and repeat business. 

The delivery experience is a critical part of the overall customer experience. It is where the rubber meets the road and where retailers’ or wholesalers’ true colors showl.
In many ways, Amazon has set the bar for the delivery experience. But, those who deliver big and bulky goods need to go beyond what Amazon offers. Consumers have come to expect rapid and high-precision delivery, and bring those expectations with them across specialty and work-related deliveries. They need to be able to select narrow delivery slots that fit their schedules, and trust that goods will arrive when promised.
There is no better way to build that trust than to offer radical transparency. When customers know how their goods are progressing on a delivery commitment, they feel calm and empowered.
Being opaque, however, has its benefits, as it offers the ability to conceal operational shortcomings and mistakes from the end-customer. Not every organization is ready for radical transparency, and there are considerations to be made before making the change. Preparation begins with the following three considerations.
1. Last-mile logistics is about customer experience
The sooner shippers begin to treat last mile as a part of the customer experience, the better. Customers want to know where their delivery is and how it tracks against the promised time window. There are a few key components that need to come into play in order to do so:
●     Flexible, multi-choice delivery dates and times.
●      Consistent follow-through, on time and without error.
●      Regular communication and order tracking.
●      Visibility down to the driver level.
Timely, effective communication to customers about last-mile delivery is more complicated than it sounds. Where notifications are concerned, some systems are limited in capabilities, or are too aggressive and can burden a consumer with irrelevant or excessive updates. The best software balances direct communication with customers by being transparent at critical moments in the fulfillment process, e.g., a scheduling prompt after purchase, when an order arrives at the warehouse, a reminder before the day of delivery and so on.                                                                                  
Also, the human trust factor is inherent to long-term successful system adoption should not be forgotten. The software must be user friendly with enough depth to do the job yet allow new users to feel “in control.” Dispatchers care deeply about their customers and how their brand is represented and will only continue using software that they trust will deliver predictable results.
2. Transparency can be risky if not prepared
Companies that struggle with on-time delivery and precision across deliveries need to consider solutions to internal issues before providing radical transparency. Sharing increased visibility leaves little room for error and companies need to be prepared to put their best foot forward.
Understanding key pain points such as driver compliance, late delivery or long delivery windows and inconsistency across the third-party logistics (3PL) provider is essential to making adjustments. A driver app that provides a digital way to dispatch orders, driving directions, GPS tracking, frictionless communications with customers and easy documentation of deliveries is necessary to ensure driver adoption and proper use.
 High-precision routing is key to managing variables such as traffic, weather, directions and more to provide the most efficient and accurate delivery routes, so that drivers can meet customer time windows every time and companies can even narrow windows. Lastly, the software utilized must be seamlessly integrated by 3PL partners to ensure that customer experience is consistent.
3. Customer communication is key
Considering what modern customers expect, companies will find that consistent, accurate communication is central to meeting those needs. Customers need to know where their delivery is, and how it is tracking vs. the promised delivery slot. By providing this in real-time, companies can make last-mile logistics into a customer experience advantage. By ensuring that communication systems are in place that allows for real-time updates that are easily accessible for customers and often provided by automated systems or drivers.
Consistent on-time performance is important, but issues and mistakes will happen, and radical transparency can help to make the most of even less-than-ideal circumstances. Sometimes radical transparency means telling customers you’ll be delayed. The benefit to this communication is that it allows customers to adjust their expectations and plans, which will ultimately lead to a better overall experience, even when things don’t go as planned.
There is no better way to build trust than to offer radical transparency. When customers know how you are progressing toward delivering on your commitments, they can feel calm. And, worst case, if you are running late, they can adjust their plans.
Ultimately, radical transparency is the key to building lasting customer relationships that result in satisfaction and repeat business. This level of visibility is not easy to achieve and takes planning, consistency and ongoing effort to maintain. Shippers have the opportunity to provide a customer experience that goes beyond the point of purchase and continues through the last mile by expanding comfortability with radical transparency.

With the accelerated digitisation of the world, the automotive industry is gearing up to an enormous change in 2021.
The automotive industry has long been a place where industrial and tech sector disrupts to make innovative solutions. The industry is adopting technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data & analytics that have been around for a while, and newer technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain are also finding numerous applications in the automotive sector. With the accelerated digitisation of the world, the automotive industry is gearing up to an enormous change in 2021. The sector has seen unprecedented twists and turns in the past ten years. They’ve turned sleeker, safer and capable of higher speeds. 
Ultimately, just like how McKinsey reported in 2016, the auto industry is gradually moving towards the future age, wherein automakers will find themselves generating more revenue and users will find themselves enjoying innovative driving solutions. But 2020 was a slow year with not many people buying cars during the Covid-19 pandemic period. However, the industry is starting to rebound and gives an array of hope to everyone. Henceforth, Analytics Insight brings you a list of tech trends that will dominate the automotive industry in 2021.
AI-based autonomous vehicle
AI-based autonomous vehicles are the frontrunners in the automotive industry. Artificial intelligence is already enabling smart travel methods through self-driving cars. These cars do not require drivers and rely on sensors and software for navigation and control. Autonomous vehicles are aimed to reduce the need for human drivers and make everyday transport easy. Studies reflect that there are around 1,400 self-driving cars on the US roads today. 
Even though when it is not a big number, the change of mind in people to go for or trust autonomous vehicles is drastically increasing. Big players like Tesla, Google, Uber are strongly pushing the limits of autonomous cars, making it more reliable. However, the Covid-19 pandemic was a big hit which temporarily staggered the improvement of self-driving vehicles. With the autonomous vehicle industry estimated to be worth US$556 million by 2026, investments will likely continue to pour in, especially as further applications are explored.
Digital marketing and dealing
The futuristic view of selling automotive vehicles online came to effect during the coronavirus pandemic. Even though when in-person visiting to dealership stores and trial driving was a mandatory part of buying a car, the lockdown protocols that limited the move switched its track to online medium. Not all, but at least a small proportion of people feel comfortable about the change. 
Vehicle buyers are able to compare different car models unlike going on with the dealer’s suggestion. Modern dealerships are trying to normalise online car buying by offering provisions starting form virtual tours to secure checkout, online financial options and returns policies. So far, 81% of the buyers are not okay with buying new or old cars online. However, this is expected to change in 2021.
Electrification
The increase in fossil fuel rate and the harm to the environment caused by their use has changed the automotive industry outlook to electric vehicles (EVs). Cars contribute to 15% of carbon emissions, which deplete precious fossil fuel reserves and causes potential irreversible environmental damage. 
Electric cars on the other hand are addressing the challenges by leveraging a higher level of energy efficiency and reduced fuel usage. In August 2020, there were over 1.6 million electric vehicles on the US road, which is exponentially higher than the expected 1.4 million by 2024. Still, for greater adoption and people’s acceptance, electric vehicles need to come up with solutions on high price, poor battery, inadequate charging infrastructure, fleet electrification and renewable energy-based charging grids.
Blockchain
Blockchain has been likened to the second generation of the internet. It has the ability to transform an organisation’s processes. This includes sharing vehicle data over a secure network for connectivity and shared mobility solutions such as ride-hailing, urban transportation and deliveries. Blockchain is used in the verification process to improve efficiency across supply chain and back-office works. It can be utilized in management and incentives to improve vehicle information and usage data across the industry. The disruption of blockchain in automotive is anticipated to increase in the upcoming year.
3D printing
The automotive industry is always facing a demand for new vehicles and spare products. The thirst for newer, better performing vehicles, as well as the need to optimize production and streamline supply chains and logistics, is also spiking. One technology that is helping to meet these challenges is 3D printing. 3D printing technology is being explored across all areas of automotive production. Aside from its extensive use for rapid prototyping, the technology is also being used to produce tooling and end parts.

ARK believes that vertical integration through a ride-hail network would:
De-risk Tesla’s financial model;Lay the operational foundation for its robotaxi network; andIncrease the odds that its robotaxi initiative will succeed.
ARK believes that a ride-hail network will enhance Tesla’s profitability prior to the launch of a robotaxi service. Moreover, it seems that the launch of a robotaxi service would not tie up significant engineering resources except for routing, payment integration, and other functions that will be critical to the launch of robotaxis.
Finally, a vertically integrated ride-hail service with highly utilized electric vehicles would increase the share of miles driven on electric platforms, advancing Tesla’s mission of converting the world to sustainable energy.
De-Risk the Financial Model
While the launch of a commercial robotaxi business should transform Tesla’s profitability radically, its technical feasibility is somewhat uncertain. ARK previously detailed how a robotaxi service could increase Tesla’s valuation by 10x, though in our published base case valuation we assigned only a 30% probability to its success.
Pursuing a vertically integrated ride-hail service, Tesla could unlock the benefits of a robotaxi-like financial model and at the same time lower considerably the technical risk of launching a robotaxi network. For the first 3 million cars sold into the ride-hail channel, ARK believes that Tesla would generate net profits per mile close to that of an autonomous robotaxi service. As shown below, a vertically integrated ride-hail service priced in line with existing services like Uber and Lyft should generate 28 cents of profit per mile. While ARK expects the price-per-mile of a robotaxi network to decline over time, without the expense of human drivers and with the increased convenience and value profile for consumers,  its profitability still should be similar to that of ride-hail services, as shown below.

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon.
Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2020
According to ARK’s research, while the addressable market of a robotaxi network is 100x larger than that of a ride-hail service, Tesla would generate recurring profitability earlier and more predictably were it to launch both services. ARK’s modeling suggests that in 2025 ride-hail could increase Tesla’s recurring operating earnings by over $30 billion, bolstering its valuation relative to that for its standalone EV business. If Tesla were to decide against the commercial launch of robotaxis, then a ridehail service alone could improve its profitability and ultimately account for roughly 30% of the company’s enterprise value by ARK’s estimates.
Lay the Operational Foundation for the Robotaxi Network
The operational requirements for vertically integrated ride-hail services are similar to those for commercial robotaxi systems, as shown below. To commercialize its robotaxi network, Tesla will have to integrate payments, develop routing and matching algorithms for riders and drivers, recruit and train vehicle-owners to join the platform, concentrate fleet assets in target markets, and attract prospective riders. Each of those capabilities would be necessary to support a ride-hail service as well, so why would Tesla wait until Full-Self-Driving software to develop them?

Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2020
Not all the preparation for a vertically integrated ridehail service would add value to Tesla’s robotaxi initiative. Notably, Tesla would have to develop sales and recruitment strategies for a ride-hail service on a city-by-city basis. Though it could attract drivers to its platform, the startup costs probably would exceed those of launching a robotaxi service.
That said, while drivers would be committing to a platform aiming ultimately to disintermediate their driving services, they also would be investing in an asset—a vehicle—that would appreciate, in our view meaningfully, when converted to a robotaxi. Drivers would become vehicle operators, with incentives to keep their vehicles clean, charged, and utilized.
Increase the Odds of Robotaxi Success
While Tesla could launch a ride-hail service on time, the robotaxi landscape is littered with missed timelines and false starts. Many auto manufacturers once expected to launch truly driverless capabilities by 2020 but not one delivered on time. Even Waymo, the Alphabet subsidiary supposedly two months from commercial launch in November 2018, delayed its launch by roughly two years. Tesla also has slipped on its timelines, suggesting that the technical challenge associated with autonomous driving is daunting.
That said, we believe Tesla does have a significant competitive advantage: it can source real-world driving data and deploy real-world tests of its autonomous system at scale. Tesla’s fleet – all of the Model S’s, 3’s, X’s, and Y’s equipped with Autopilot on roads today – drives more miles in a day than Waymo’s fleet does in a year.[1] Tesla can collect more real-world examples of idiosyncratic faults or corner cases more quickly than can Waymo and then can battle test solutions against real-world conditions across roughly one million vehicles.
While ARK believes Tesla already has access to more driving data than any company in the world, ride-hail miles could be even more valuable to Tesla as they would mimic the future trips taken in robotaxis. A ride-hail network would give Tesla significantly more data to train Autopilot. Based on traditional car-driving habits, ARK estimates that Tesla will have access to more than 40 million miles of driving data per day by the end of 2020. According to our estimates, ride-hail could boost its annual real-world driving data generation by roughly 70% by 2025, as shown below.
Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2020
As a result, Tesla will have access to more corner cases as it trains its autonomous neural nets, potentially solving for full autonomy sooner than would otherwise be the case. More real-world driving data also will be critical in convincing regulators that Tesla’s autonomous system is safe. To demonstrate that the performance of its autonomous vehicles is statistically superior to that of human drivers, ARK believes Tesla will have to provide regulators with billions of miles of data. Ride-hailing miles could shave months and perhaps years from the time and data collection necessary for regulatory approval.
In the next year, given the number of Uber and Lyft drivers in need of work after the coronavirus crisis juxtaposed against the increased consumer demand for transport options other than mass transit, a Tesla ride-hail network could be well-timed.  Today, approximately 13 million US gig workers are collecting unemployment benefits in the wake of the coronavirus, and subway usage is down nearly 70% in New York City.  Ride-hailing also could provide free marketing focused on potential Tesla buyers, particularly in urban areas. Consequently, a ride-hail network could benefit not only Tesla’s bottom line but also serve public needs both during and after the pandemic.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is everywhere, particularly in our homes from voice assistants and smart bulbs to thermostats that learn user preferences and habits. But what the hype, hoopla and smart refrigerators don’t tell you is that IoT will actually pave the way to a much more interconnected world. It’s more than a watch counting steps and miles – IoT is about a connectivity revolution. It allows for unprecedented convenience and ushers in a new era of innovations.
A world of intelligence
Today’s smart home consists of voice-activated devices that can interface with some items and appliances but it’s only the start of what’s to come. In the not-too-distant future, everything in your home will be connected not only for simple commands but for intuitive solutions that intelligently react without the need for user input.
Freshly brewed coffee – a frequently cited feature of the smart home and IoT – is just the beginning. For example, when connected to a smart oven, a smartphone would know when its user wakes up and automatically begin the preheating process. This could be done without any form of privacy invasion. The oven would know when the alarm is scheduled to ring. It would then wait for confirmation – through an app or by detecting when the alarm is turned off – before preheating. This would make it easy to pop in a frozen croissants for a quick breakfast before work.
At the same time, a smart thermostat could automatically adjust to compensate for the increase in heat from the oven or lights could automatically turn on as well, but only in rooms that are about to be entered. Knowing when it’s almost time to leave for work, a connected car could automatically open the garage and start its engine. If left outside in the snow, the vehicle would know to start even sooner, providing enough time for icy windshields to melt and clear before it’s time to leave. The possibilities are endless and really show the power of a truly connected world.
Driving toward the future
IoT is going to have a big impact on mobility, but it will start long before fully autonomous vehicles are on our roads. As smart cities come online, drivers will gain access to more than real-time traffic information – they’ll know exactly which roads provide the fastest route. Traffic signal details will be sent directly to the car, which will share them with the driver.
 The car’s own details (such as speed and location) will be sent back to the traffic signal, allowing the two to the interface. Then, if north and southbound traffic is light but eastbound traffic is picking up, the signal could automatically adjust to compensate, extending the green light for the greatest number of drivers.
When cars are capable of driving themselves, IoT-infused features would be taken to a whole other level. Instead of merely providing all of the smart city information to the driver, that info would go directly to the vehicle, which would take the most efficient, time-saving route to and from work.
Autonomous vehicles will allow occupants to use the commute to do whatever they want, and those things could be carried over when returning home. If watching a movie, for example, it could be instantaneously transferred (from a device or in-car display) to a living room TV, allowing the viewer to resume with the press of a single button.
Shop smarter than ever before
One of the most exciting parts of IoT is how it will transform the world of retail. Right now, it’s easy to walk into a store and leave without one of the key items you came to get. Maybe the items were misplaced or you simply forgot them. In any case, this will inevitably lead to an extra trip back to the store.
With IoT, each item could have an RFID (radio-frequency identification) tag that pings your phone as soon as you approach. Many stores already use these tags for security purposes or in their warehouses, so why not expand on this functionality? Grocery stores could install LED signs that flash not only for sales but for items added to your shopping list. Additionally, imagine the power of a retailer that uses large screens to highlight items that customers recently viewed online. Sensors could connect with each shopper’s phone to view their store history and tailor the displayed items accordingly. This would bring one of the best components of dot-com shopping to physical retail.
Surely there may be concerns about consumer adoption. While smart thermostats have turned off some individuals over fears of privacy, smart meters – electric, water or gas – have caused a stir over the increase in radiofrequency exposure. Consumers have a right to be concerned about these potential issues and should absolutely insist that manufacturers rectify them before they are welcomed into our homes.
Other consumers are eager to be early adopters regardless, embracing technological innovations first and worrying about any possible consequences later. Both groups are important to the future of technology: the latter allows innovations to flourish, the former ensures that they are refined and improved to meet all consumer needs.
Some subtle innovations are already being deployed to great effect, bringing retail into the 21st century. But it’s not just what you buy and how you find it in store – the future also involves how you pay and exit. One new concept, dubbed “just walk out,” allows consumers to buy whatever they want without ever having to wait in line for a cashier – Amazon Go has been trialing this with some success. In fact, checkouts have been eliminated entirely. 
Using a mix of smartphone technology, in-store sensors and artificial intelligence, “just walk out” is several steps above the self-checkout terminals that have been added to most retailers. As a smart store, the entire retail establishment can determine which items have been placed in a cart, as well as those that have been placed back on the shelf. This technology will only get better with time, providing even more opportunities for intelligent shopping experiences.
The Internet of absolutely everything
IoT is mentioned so frequently, it might come across as just another type of marketing speak. But there is truth to the hype, and there are no limits to what the “everything” in IoT will entail. There are also no limits to how consumers will respond. Some will inevitably worry about privacy or security.
 Others might be concerned about the possible health risks, such as those associated with smart meters. Whether or not these concerns are overblown remains to be seen, but that’s why tech makers must continue to be open and honest about how their technology works. The connectivity revolution depends on it – and the future growth of IoT demands it.

Imagine this – instead of waking up an hour early to start your arduous commute to work, fighting traffic the whole way, you hail a car as you’re getting ready using your smartphone. It arrives as you’re walking out your door, and shuttles you to your destination.
There is no driver of this vehicle – instead, an array of high-tech tools and sensors keeps the car on its path. In fact, no vehicles on the road are being operated by a human. Traffic is nonexistent, accidents are unheard of and you’re able to relax, have a cup of coffee and start working through your inbox before you even arrive at the office.

It sounds like science fiction, but this future isn’t far off. The Boston Consulting Group estimates that by 2030 almost a quarter of all miles driven in the U.S. will be by shared, selfdriving vehicles.

ABI research indicates that in that same time period, 11 million shared driverless vehicles will be on the road globally – about 5 percent of the world’s traffic. And these changes are already occurring; early this month, Alphabet’s Waymo unit announced self-driving vehicles will be available in the Phoenix area through the ride-hailing service Lyft.
“As a first step, we’ll deploy 10 Waymo vehicles on Lyft over the next few months,” Waymo CEO John Krafcik wrote in a post on Medium. “Once Waymo vehicles are on the platform, Lyft users in the area will have the option to select a Waymo directly from the Lyft app for eligible rides.”
Clearly, this technology is already out there – communities just need to figure out how to best utilize it. Experts agree driverless vehicles will signal a new era in transportation, but unless local leaders begin to plan for this future, putting thoughtful policy in place and creating the proper infrastructure, what should be a science fiction dream could turn into a dystopian nightmare.

The driverless dream
He lays out three scenarios in his book – what he calls the good, the bad and the ugly. The best outcome he foresees is that leaders begin now to shift the public’s desire for privately owned vehicles toward what he calls autonomous micro transit – essentially, autonomous vehicles should be fleet-owned and used as first-mile/ last-mile solutions to support existing public transportation systems.
Sam Schwartz, author of “No One at the Wheel: Driverless Cars and the Road of the Future,” and former chief traffic engineer for New York City’s Department of Transportation, makes the argument that cities should not let these technologies evolve organically. Local leaders need to be proactive and take control of the future of Transportation in their communities, or else.
A worse outcome, Schwartz says, would be fleet-owned autonomous vehicles operating independently of a greater mass public transit system. This would be likely to be the result of overconfidence in autonomous vehicles’ ability to increase roadway capacity. Some experts argue that since autonomous vehicles remove the potential for human error, they would be able to follow each other more closely, essentially mimicking the capacity of a bus or train line.
“There’s no way they could come close,” Schwartz says, “Maybe you’ll increase capacity to the point that each vehicle is one second apart – that’s 3,600 vehicles per hour per lane. This doesn’t mean we’ve increased the person capacity because some of those vehicles will be empty going to pick someone up or leaving someone they just dropped off.”
This would essentially be history repeating itself. “We lost so much good transit when the automobile came on the scene,” he says. “We bought hook line and sinker that we could solve our transportation problems with the automobile and building roadways. A lot of places tried that – look at Los Angeles… once had the best transit system in the country… now the traffic is horrendous.” Schwartz cautions local leaders to think critically about how autonomous vehicles could support mass transit, not replace it.
The worst outcome Schwartz envisions is letting autonomous vehicles hit the streets with minimal thought regarding their impact. These vehicles would be privately owned, and greatly increase congestion in urban areas.
“Let’s say someone comes to visit me in Midtown Manhattan. You tell the car to go park, the car says it’s $50 dollars to park, sorry,” Schwartz laughs. “So, you tell the car to go home – now you have double the miles in that case.
Our nature as human beings is to do what’s best for us as individuals and not necessarily what’s best for society, so we’re going to have so many zombie cars zooming all around doing what’s most convenient for the owner, adding lots of traffic, creating more gridlock than it solves. That’s a future I worry about.”
One thing seems to be certain, though – this future is coming, and it’s going to be disruptive.

Designing the future
Today’s roadways and intersections are designed to move human-operated vehicles during peak congestion hours. These roadways usually have multiple lanes for traffic and dedicated turn lanes adding to their footprint. Pedestrians cross at intersections controlled by timed signals. Parking lots flank most roadways, providing access to retail and residential spaces.
Simply put, a lot of our landscapes – particularly in urban environments – are paved, Sohrweide says. One of the first major ways driverless vehicles will impact our streets is in their design. Generally speaking, Tom Sohrweide, a transportation and traffic engineer consultant for Short Elliott Hendrickson, anticipates these technologies will facilitate the narrowing of roadways, freeing up more space for pedestrians, bikes, scooters and other forms of alternative transportation.
However, when the capabilities of driverless cars are taken into consideration in the design process, roadways can start to change. “With automated vehicles, we would anticipate the headways [the space between two traveling vehicles] would be greatly reduced,” Sohrweide says.  
“By platooning vehicles more, less roadway needs to be used. Instead of things being spread out, they can be consolidated which can, in turn, relate to fewer lanes. Speed differentials will be better controlled – if you get people going the same speed that would also impact roadway capacity.”
The need for parking will also be greatly reduced, Sohrweide says. If fleets of driverless cars operate like a modern transit system with the ability to pick up and drop off passengers continuously, the need for parking lots would be greatly reduced, and these lots could become more remote. This, in turn, would change the way urban landscapes are developed. Without the need for massive parking lots and huge parking decks, city planners could focus on better uses for these plots of land.
Cornell Robertson, Franklin County, Ohio engineer, agrees that considerations need to be taken now to prepare for a driverless future. One of the biggest challenges he sees for his community, however, is preparing all the various types of roadways that the county owns.
“We have a wide range of roadway types – we have urban roadways that are curb and gutter streets, but we also have rural routes that don’t necessarily have curb and gutter but have striping. We also have rural routes that don’t have striping,” Robertson says. “We have school zones, we have railroad crossings – all these various road types are going to be important to study, and we’re going to have to account for all these variations.”   
He’s also concerned about how the patterns of roadway deterioration will change as automation becomes more prevalent. “We have to be careful. When driving becomes automated, there’s a likelihood that the variability of driving will be removed. This will allow for narrower roadways, but if that variability is removed from how vehicles are driven, that will increase the localized wear and tear. This could mean the vehicles – from one car to the next – are traveling over the exact same wheel paths… It’s a nice idea that roadways could be narrowed, but there could be a tradeoff to that concept.”
This shift would necessitate changes in the ways roads are constructed and maintained. Robertson says his county is already exploring innovative ways to make repairs, including chip and seal. As opposed to milling out a roadway and resurfacing it, an emulsion is laid down on the surface and an aggregate is placed into the emulsion.
The roadway is then brushed to remove excess materials and a layer of sealant is applied. This method is much faster and much cheaper, Robertson says. It’s a simple concept, but the individual components of the process have been dramatically improved over the years.
Robertson says the county is also exploring ground rubber tire fibers being added into asphalt mixes. This is an environmentally friendly concept that minimizes the number of old tires going into landfills, and could potentially be a way to create more durable roadways in the future.
This new construction and the redesign of existing roadways will, of course, demand funding; however, as technologies change, our current funding models are becoming outdated. This begs the question – how are we going to pay for this?

Funding the future
Kevin Stone, executive director of the National Association of County Engineers, says the most pervasive model for funding roadways in this country is through gas taxes; however, as fuel efficiencies improve, more hybrid vehicles take to the road and alternative-fuel vehicles become more popular, the revenue generated by this tax is becoming diminished, and communities are barely able to keep up with necessary repairs.
“As technology improves, whether it be fuel standards, autonomous vehicles, intelligent transportation systems or smart vehicle technology, your gas tax money is dwindling,” Stone says. “A lot of the ideas coming out of Congress right now are moving toward vehicle miles traveled, or the VMT model… You’re paying by the mile.”
This essentially sets up roadway infrastructure funding like a utility – the heaviest users pay the most. It’s a more equitable, more up-to-date funding method that Michelle Godfrey, public information officer for Oregon’s Department of Transportation, hopes will become more popular as transportation methods evolve.
Oregon is the first state in the country to launch a fully operational vehicle-miles-traveled tax program. OreGO launched on July 1, 2015, the pilot program is the first to actually use real drivers to collect real data in real time and collecting real money. However, as the program is in its infancy, it’s on a voluntary basis and is limited to 5,000 vehicles, Godfrey says.
“The program isn’t intended to generate any significant revenue like the gas tax does,” Godfrey says. “We like to call it a test run of the system.”
So far, it’s been a resounding success. Godfrey says they’ve been able to demonstrate functionality with every aspect of the system, from customers interacting with third-party account managers to transferring funds into the state treasury.
The program works by having drivers plug a device into their vehicle’s data port, similar to what’s used for pay-as-you-go insurance models. That device connects wireless to transmit mileage and fuel consumption data back to a third-party account manager.
That data is then used to determine how much fuel tax was paid versus how much is owed based on a rate of 1.7 cents per mile. The fuel taxes paid are then credited against the road usage charge. If the customer is owed once this calculation is complete, they are issued a voucher for the difference. Most in the program, however, just about break even.
So why would anyone volunteer to pay an extra tax? Godfrey admits there’s little incentive currently, aside from participating in a program that will likely be the framework for funding roadways in the near future. “These are people that are interested in road use charging,” Godfrey says. “They are thought leaders, technology leaders. They are curious about how it works. It’s not sustainable as a voluntary program, though.”
One issue the pilot program is revealing, however, is that public perception has a lot to do with the success of such a funding method. Currently, it seems people think that if they live in a more rural area and have to drive further distances, they’ll be disadvantaged by such a tax. Godfrey, however, says this isn’t necessarily the case.
“The gas tax is a proxy for a per-mile charge, so they’re already paying more than they would under a road-charge system because they’re consuming more fuel,” Godfrey explains. “They’re already subsidizing current [lower mileage] drivers. That’s why the current gas tax has become so unfair – because so many vehicles on the road are getting such wildly different fuel efficiencies.”
Another issue with perception that needs to be addressed is the “big brother” spookiness of willfully putting a government-issued tracking device into a private vehicle. This will take public education campaigns to overcome, Godfrey says. While OreGO does collect location data, this data is collected only by the third-party account manager, meaning it never reaches the government and is destroyed by law within 30 days. While people were wary at first, Godfrey says that trepidation is waning.
“As people become more comfortable and familiar with using GPS and other similar devices, they have less objection to having this device in their vehicle,” Godfrey says. “When they try the program, they understand how it gives them added value – there are all kinds of other services they can get from their account manager aside from the tax program.” For example, users can track their vehicle if its stolen, they can geofence their vehicle so their teen driver can’t stray too far from home and they can receive critical service updates and component failure warnings.”
While these hurdles might be difficult to clear, Godfrey thinks this model will likely become more popular as vehicle technology advances. “This is a modern technology that addresses the funding problems based on how drivers operate today,” she says. “The gas tax is based on how things worked 100 years ago. The future of transportation demands a modern technological solution. We think this is the most fair.”

Preparing for the future
In an article he wrote regarding the transition to driverless vehicles, Sohrweide offers two pieces of advice for local leaders. First, he encourages them to stay informed and be proactive. Although we’re still about a decade away by most experts’ estimates, it’s important to stay up to date on how these technologies are being developed, where they are being deployed and the lessons that are already being learned.
Several states have established advisory boards on the topic – such as Minnesota’s Governor’s Advisory Council on Connected and Automated Vehicles. He encourages local leaders to seek out such resources.    
Second, Sohrweide says communities need to be intentional but realistic about the roadways they are designing today. Citing data from the National League of Cities, he says only 6 percent of major U.S. cities’ long-range transportation master plans are considering the challenges of automated vehicles.
Ignoring the issue is folly. Today’s roads need to be designed with this future in mind. Focusing on a more equal mix of transportation modes, prioritizing pedestrian and cycle traffic and anticipating the needs of tomorrow’s vehicles will position communities to better handle the challenges ahead.

Orlando strives to be a world-class city by finding ways to improve things, such as transportation.
One of those efforts underway is the Future-Ready City Master Plan, which proposes a longterm strategy for implementing new programs and policies to advance mobility, digital connectivity, energy, health and safety, placemaking such as housing, water conservation and materials such as recycling. The plan has been in the works since 2019, and may play a role in helping improve daily commutes for thousands of Orlando workers who rely on mass transit.
Improving how workers get around town is vital to the region — especially helping workers cover what experts call the “tricky” first and last miles of their trips. For example, in Seminole and Orange counties, 41% of residents live more than three-quarters of a mile from a Lynx bus stop, according to the Central Florida Regional Transit Authority, which oversees the Lynx public bus system. That hurdle causes undue stress to workers and can hurt productivity.
The Future-Ready City plan tackles various aspects of transportation, including finding ways to incentivize more use of mass transit via rewards for users. That can be in the form of gift cards that may help make traveling for commuters more rewarding and help offset other costs in their daily lives. Other initiatives are to implement more data synchronization where users can have more precise information on the locations of buses and rail times, as well as simplifying the payment systems for those different entities into one simple platform.
The goal of Orlando’s Future-Ready plan will help make those residents’ lives a little easier, Michael Hess, director of Future Ready for the city, told Orlando Business Journal. The plan will take some time to integrate as it’s all very new, but the potential is there, he added.
“There’s a bunch of different data initiatives in the transportation space that have been evolving over the last few years where we actually can see Lynx bus locations real time. Those technology hurdles are still a little painful to do that integration, but it’s evolving. Picture if you are doing a trip that involves both Lynx bus and SunRail and you can see real time: ‘I’m on the train right now, when is my train going to get to the station and where is the bus and when will that get to the station. Am I going to make it?’ So hopefully, it makes it easier for everyone.”
Here, Hess shares some specifics of the future-ready plan that may ease transportation for commuters or encourage the use of mass transit while making it more affordable:
How did you account for working-class commuters for the plan? We engaged the community when we were developing this plan. Earlier this year, we did a lot of community meetings in each district. We had a lot of the general public attend community workshops, so when we built this plan, we allowed the community to tell us what issues they saw and what ideas they had to solve those issues. Working with our consultant VHB and other experts, we [shared[ ideas we saw in other cities and allowed our residents to vote.
How will the incentive system work? There are apps you already can use that act as a frequent flier program and will reward you. What we are looking to do is partner with some of those companies to feed out very specific challenges to help with our city issues. Those technology providers will have their standard rewards programs. By partnering with those companies, the city can issue challenges. For example, if we wanted to increase use of scooter share or walking or SunRail and Lymmo, we can push out challenges that offer gift cards — a $5 gift card if you ride SunRail four times this week. That’s the area we are looking to add in to push alternative transit that will help the city of Orlando.
Can that incentive system eventually include regional partners like free SunRail rides? It can. It starts to get harder to do because you need to have multiple regional entities coordinating. This first year we will focus on challenges with gift cards, and if it’s successful, we will start to further our partnerships with SunRail and others to offer those rewards. We will get there, but in this first year we will keep it simple.
What other metros did you see have success with a reward-style program? We did research of Smart City technology all across the world. We want to be out front and think we will be because we made this comprehensive plan that others haven’t. The city of Sacramento, California, has been doing a rewards program for over a year now, and Jacksonville Transit Authority just started doing a rewards program maybe a month or two ago. Also, CalTrain, [the commuter rail] out in California, has been doing this type of approach. Some of the ones from California started to show the amount of money they invested in rewards, they exceeded that in additional revenue by encouraging people to ride. We’ve seen success in California and want to try in Orlando if we can translate that success here.
What’s the strategy behind the single payment system? That’s one of our mid-term strategies, probably a couple of years out, related to a short-term strategy around trying to use technology to better integrate all our mobility options so anyone can see what their different options are to get from Point A to Point B. Is there an easy way to jump on a Lynx bus to get to SunRail or SunRail to a scooter? Right now that’s very siloed. You have to look at the SunRail map separately and go to the Lynx app or website to see what they have, and that creates friction in the system. So the single payment piece will be built on top of that to make it easier for people to use alternative forms of transit to make it more frictionless. The people who use it every day, we might save them a little time. We hope if we can make it easier, we can expand ridership and then expand routes.
When can we expect to see the single payment portion of the plan? As we go through the budgeting process, we will reprioritize projects, continue to talk the community, look at the city budget and prioritize accordingly every year. The single payment side is mid-term. But short-term, we want to build the platform where you can see the information n one place and then that will be platform you can build on and put in the payment system and build the features over time. It will be a multiyear project.
How important will this plan be for the working class that doesn’t have a car? Extremely important. If you look at the foundational elements of this plan and some of the common themes we heard form community engagement, a lot was around equity and inclusion. When we were picking this strategy, those foundational elements were part of our prioritization process. We specifically wanted to pick strategies that would help everyone, not just trying to buy some shiny technology that only helps a few. We are extremely focused on having everything we do help with equity and inclusion.

 Non-automotive companies enter the fray to develop tech for connected, autonomous, shared, and electric mobility along with global auto majors
Frost & Sullivan’s recent analysis, Strategic Insight into the Future of the Global Mobility Technology Market, reports that advancements in mobility technology will open new growth opportunities for companies aiming to tap into mobility services and solutions of the future, such as mobility-as-a-service, shared and autonomous fleets, and mobility operating systems. 
This is expected to result in greater collaborations and merger and acquisition (M&A) activities in the sector amongst automotive incumbents, technology giants, network infrastructure providers, and mobility tech start-ups.
“Technology is emerging as the centerpiece in mobility. The focus is shifting from operators and business models toward developing technology capabilities.
 Advanced technologies, such as APIs, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud platforms, mobility service platforms, V2X and V2G technologies, and predictive modeling are starting to shape new mobility,” said Abhishek Iyer, Research Analyst. “The interest shown by ICT companies and start-ups towards connected, autonomous, shared, and electric (CASE) mobility has initiated a multi-industry convergence towards mobility technologies.
 However, a singular approach towards these aspects is restrictive in terms of capturing the huge potential that exists. The collective involvement of participants with varied capabilities is essential towards solving the future mobility equation.”
Iyer added: “As technology evolves, services are becoming more complex and nuanced. New opportunities can be found in areas such as fleet orchestration, mobility planning and designing, and seamless transition from human-driven to autonomous fleets. Also, 5G networks will play a crucial role in the advancement of future shared, automated, and connected vehicles. Omnipresent wireless networks that have extensive coverage, high data transfer speeds, and low latency will drive the advancements in highly connected shared mobility technologies.”
For further revenue opportunities, market participants should explore these strategic recommendations:
Providers of future mobility solutions and services must leverage and continue to build on their core technological strengths to capture underlying growth opportunities effectively.While the fastest route to gaining access to these technologies is through mergers and acquisitions, companies should develop a strategic roadmap to lay out a clear picture of how their existing core expertise would integrate with the acquisition of new technology capabilities to drive innovation further.Extensive collaboration among long-standing participants from the automotive and technology sector along with the value provided by new mobility technology suppliers is required to enable disruption in the evolving landscape. This collaboration becomes even more essential for existing companies to survive and thrive over the next decade, which is expected to change the face of mobility as we see it.Success in the mobility technology ecosystem will depend on the development of new business models and revenue strategies, which can harness the potential of cross-industry expertise and incorporate them into mobility technology solutions and services. While the necessary focus on CASE is absolute, a well-defined and timely approach toward it will stand to make the difference.

 By Nick Tebbutt 
For some time now, the future mobility vision–in which totally autonomous vehicles are an everyday reality and shared mobility services are widely adopted–has been heralded as the future of mass transport. However, as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has inexplicably changed transport behaviour, both at a consumer and commercial level, the consensus is that it will significantly impact the shape of tomorrow’s strategy.  With the lockdown expected to leave a legacy of increased home working, less travelling and unprecedented delivery demand, here, Nick Tebbutt, Head of Global Strategic Sales at HORIBA MIRA, future gazes as to how the evolving post-coronavirus industry landscape may look slightly different. It is widely accepted that mobility in the decades to come will look dramatically different from what it does today. As we all expect, in the long-held vision for future mobility widespread shared ownership will be supported by an intelligent ecosystem of self-driving “taxis”–the remit being to reduce vehicle numbers and congestion, and, in turn, create and integrate in to a much greener urban transport infrastructure. However, this vision, of course, did not account for the unforeseeable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the transformative impact it has had on transport behaviour. With the nationwide lockdown seeing a large majority of the population tasked with working from home, businesses and consumers alike have been quick to realise the ease at which operations can be managed remotely, along with the multiple ensuing efficiencies. According to one recent study,140 per cent of UK businesses saw an increase in productivity during the remote working period, with 85 per cent looking to expand remote working policies as a result of the pandemic. Only recently Twitter, Square, and Facebook announced that they will allow most of their employees to telecommute permanently, while many other major employers, including Nationwide and Barclays, have talked openly about a permanent shift to working from home and reduced office space.2 And there’s the environmental benefits too. Home working cuts commuting requirements, transport congestion and environmental impacts as demonstrated by the huge falls in air pollution during the lockdown – particularly during weekday commuting hours. Thus, with businesses already under pressure to go greener, the compelling case for increased home working as a way to tackle emissions has also come to the forefront. The result could be an irrevocable impact on modern transport requirements. To put it into context, one expert study3 estimates that 87% of those currently working from home would like to continue to do so to some degree, the result of which could see the 10.8 million pre-lockdown number of regular remote workers soar to as much as 17 million. This would mean that 1 in 5 commutes by car could be avoided, equating to 11 billion miles saved per year. But, for the busy automaker whose future designs will inevitably be based on a very different picture, the question begs–how will these changes in consumer behaviour and commercial preferences impact the future mobility requirement?  
Sudden acceleration or a foot on the brakes?
Although the automotive megatrends that were occurring pre COVID-19 are still relevant, the ongoing impact of the pandemic is likely to see some fast-tracked and cause others to slow. Take, for example, electric vehicles (EV). Only this June (2020) saw the Transport Secretary confirm a £12m funding pot to support EV research and development (R&D) projects in a bid to turbocharge the UK’s transition to zero emissions vehicles. Although this amount may be marginal compared to the cost of EV battery development itself, it offers a positive indication of the government’s continued commitment to leading the EV transition, the consensus being that further stimulus may be on the way as part of its recovery plans. Add to the equation increased consumer gravitation with an estimated 12 million UK drivers considering making the EV switch in the next two years4, and the EV category clearly remains a key target area for automakers. Another area of potential growth is that of the commercial vehicle market. With the lockdown forecast to leave an enduring legacy of increased e-commerce, many consumers are now choosing to conduct their grocery shopping online on a permanent basis, and generally minimise their visits to bricks and mortar stores. This will see a huge flow-on effect for distributors and work to accelerate a more advanced, technologically-driven approach to delivery services. A good future indicator of this market shift can be found by looking at Nuro, the ground-breaking Silicon Valley robotics company which tellingly saw its autonomous grocery pod delivery service triple in demand during the recent pandemic4 and recently partnered with Kroger (the largest supermarket chain in USA) as part of its major expansion plans. This marks the start of what promises to be a global shift towards driverless grocery deliveries. And it’s not just about food shopping either. With the business case for driverless commercial EVs offering huge Total Cost of Ownership benefits – thanks to lower refinement needs, reduced non-safety electronic requirements and the opportunity to optimise a system via localised operation in a key catchment distribution area – it looks like this is a huge cost-efficiency opportunity which will be embraced by many industries in the future. In contrast, in the short to medium-term it may be that some key future automotive trends, particularly shared-mobility solutions, see a slightly lower uptake as the industry awaits the full outcome of the crisis. After all, if permanent home working increases drastically, it may be that the level of mobility required may not be as much as originally conceived or it may look slightly different, being used for personal purposes rather than the commute. Ultimately though, the need for a much cleaner transport system isn’t going to go away and the future mobility vision will take prevalence in the long-term–potentially just taking a slightly different shape. 
Navigating the new normal
There is no doubt that it is an incredibly challenging time for the automotive industry as it remains in recovery from the ongoing impact of the pandemic–all while seeking to remain competitive, profitable and future-focused. Thus, amid what is very much an evolving landscape, the onus for automakers will be on ensuring maximum productivity, increasing income efforts and generating the maximum profit margin. As part of this, at HORIBA MIRA we believe that there is an industry need to take a much more agile approach to product development and optimisation, whereby vital engineering and testing is completed at a much earlier stage of the development process to reduce project time and cost risks. For example, when our expert Vehicle Resilience team undertake any type of independent assessment for a client in the field of electrified, connected and automated vehicles we will always seek to be involved in the very initial stages of vehicle development. From thereon in, whether working in the realms of functional safety, automotive cybersecurity or electromagnetic resilience, we will take a staged approach where we go in at key gateways throughout the programme to ensure early identification of any potential related issues. Working in this way with many of the world’s leading automakers, we are able to help negate issues in the development cycle in the initial design stages and maintain a continual process of monitoring and checking at each key stage in order to ensure the highest level of engineering integrity. The result is less prototype vehicle requirements, improved accuracies and optimised efficiencies–helping to reduce project times and overall costs. Thus, as we look forward to the emerging new “normal” we find ourselves in, the onus for automakers, more than ever, will be on ensuring they remain profitable and progressive. With this in mind, early engagement with assessors offers one easy way of reducing the bottom line and maximising profit potential–helping OEMs to remain in good stead amid an emerging post-coronavirus world and future mobility vision which may look slightly different.

Smart cars, drones and car sharing are some of the ways smart cities will reduce traffic congestion. Read about 7 innovative solutions for cities.
By Maria Sotra
With fewer commuters traveling to and from work each day, cities around the world are experiencing a temporary decrease in congestion. As a result, air quality has improved dramatically, showing us the positive environmental impacts that come with reduction in traffic.However, as things begin to normalize and commuters get back in their cars, cities will inevitably see a rebound in traffic congestion. This means that now more than ever, taking the time to implement key solutions for traffic reduction is vital.During peak traffic periods, many freeways and inner-city roads resemble parking lots more than highways, despite alternate transportation options like public transit and carpooling.In California, drivers deal with some of the most congested freeways in all of the U.S., the good news is you often have good weather while stuck in traffic. The bad news? You’re stuck in traffic. According to the Bay Area’s Metropolitan Transportation Commission, traffic on major San Francisco-area freeways has increased by 80% since 2010. California is just one example.Major tech companies are taking their headquarters out of the suburbs and into cities to give their employees an urban lifestyle. However, the sudden growth in these cities has turned the “traffic headache” into the “traffic migraine.”Although it may seem impossible, technology can help. We’re talking about a future of networked systems sharing rich data about our roads and pedestrians, giving way to smart cities. And it’s already happening now.For example, cities can use aggregated data from connected vehicles to automatically identify potholes and other poor road conditions. The data can be integrated with government management so that public works or maintenance workers can automate dispatching and work orders.
Cities turn to IoT to help solve top challenges
Global spending on smart cities initiatives is projected to hit a staggering $189.5 billion in 2023. One of the most important factors in developing a smart city is making sure Internet of Things (IoT) systems are implemented in an integrated fashion. Every piece of technology must work and communicate together in order for city leaders to use IoT data effectively to improve the lives of citizens.The Smart Cities Council says that a: “Smart city uses information and communications technology (ICT) to enhance its livability, workability and sustainability.” Cities can take intelligence from sensors, IoT devices and other connected systems, then analyze it, to help better understand events and forecast emerging trends.The IDC Smart City Spending Guide suggests that global spending on IoT and Smart City technologies will crest $124 billion in 2020. This equals a year over year increase of 18.9% compared to 2019. The study points out that data driven intelligent transportation solutions account for 14% of the total global spend. The three areas identified as some of the most immediate sectors to see IoT investments are energy management, public safety and transportation.
Let’s get geeky
So what is a “smart city” technology? Well, that’s the cool part of IoT. For example, cities can inject smart tech on a mass scale into their electrical grid or municipal vehicles fleets to gain efficiencies and promote green energy initiatives. Or IoT can be deployed to measure air quality, water/wastewater management, fill levels in trash cans, necessary illumination in street lighting, Wi-Fi in public areas and so much more. Yes, there are challenges like funding and having the right, skilled workforce that can plan, implement, maintain and analyze a smart city network. But we’ll save that for another post.For now, let’s take a look at some of the neat things happening in cities that are addressing the real reason you’re reading this blog: dealing with all those parking lots also called roads.Some important terms to know:
Automotive IoT refers to in-vehicle technological solutions that collect real-time data to help to reduce costs, increase safety measures, improve vehicle efficiency and much more.IoT module An electronic device embedded in a machine or object that can connect to wireless networks to send and receive data for the purpose of analysis.Data-Driven Decision Making (DDDM) is a form of business and government operations that relies on verifiable, accurate data in order to make recommendations and provide solutions.Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology is when one vehicle is able to communicate to another vehicle nearby. It’s the core of autonomous driving technology, where sensors can detect what’s going on around the vehicle and additional technology can share that data with other vehicles on the road.Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technology is similar, in that the vehicle is able to send and receive information. In V2I, the infrastructure can include physical things such as traffic signals and weather alert systems. The vehicle can send data out while simultaneously the infrastructure can send important data back.
Smart cities can look forward to faster and more reliable internet connectivity on the 5G network. 5G is expected to have average download speeds of 50 Mbps and 10 ms latency as compared to 15 Mbps and a latency of 50 ms. Although this won’t be available to all, since coverage varies depending on location, device technology and provider.
Seven innovative ideas to reduce traffic congestion with smart city tech
1. Adaptive traffic signalsTraffic signals are getting smarter through V2I technology. The city of Columbus, Ohio, for example, is using data from its government fleet vehicles as part of other smart city pilot programs to also improve the timing of traffic signals and institute more solutions founded on DDDM. By getting a better idea of traffic flow and how long a vehicle idles at stop lights, the city can better modify traffic signal timing with the changes in traffic throughout the day.
2. V2I smart corridorsSome smart corridors include adaptive traffic signals, in which signal timing changes are automatically made depending on actual traffic demand. Smart corridors can address traffic congested roads as well as hazardous areas, such as one major highway in Wyoming used heavily for freight transportation in addition to regular passenger cars.Using V2I technology, Wyoming implemented a pilot project that would send safety-related weather and accident alerts to drivers volunteering for the program. To do this, 75 short-range communications units are being installed along the highway that can communicate with the other units and the vehicles that have devices installed. Officials expect a significant effect on safety and even the economy since the state will likely spend less energy on accident clean-up and highway closures to deal with tractor-trailer blow-overs.The City of Atlanta has committed to smart transportation investment in V2I with adaptive traffic signal technology, connected video cameras and more, the city is serving as a real-world testing ground for smart transit corridor technology to reduce traffic congestion. Atlanta has recently approved an investment of $173 billion over 30 years towards a transit overhaul plan.Geotab also collaborated with Waycare and the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC) to create a first-of-its-kind product that uses data-driven analytics and actions to support traffic signal operation.3. Autonomous vehicle technologyWhile autonomous vehicles won’t necessarily decrease the number of cars on the road, they are likely to reduce congestion and collisions due to driver error.Platooning is one example of an autonomous vehicle technology. If all roads on the vehicle had autonomous technology, vehicles would be able to speed up and slow down, and merge onto and off of freeways without human intervention, creating a much smoother driving pattern. Platooning is a first-step toward self-driving cars since it requires vehicles on a freeway to communicate with each other about speed and conditions, allowing the vehicles to travel consistently. It would eliminate human error that causes issues like phantom traffic jams, which are caused by the ripple effect of a driver braking in the middle of a freeway.Further bolstering public transit with more first- and last-mile solutions, will also help with traffic congestion by ultimately reducing the number of passenger vehicles on the road. For example, companies like Lyft and Uber are looking at how autonomous vehicles could make their services more viable in conjunction with public transit.4. Real-time traffic feedbackThis affects use of public transit, such as a new project in Kansas City that has a free streetcar carrying up to 6,200 passengers a day in a major business district. The success of the program is largely attributed to all the real-time traffic feedback — not just for where exactly the streetcar is at all times but also the traffic around the downtown area, IoT modules in kiosks allowing them to show available parking spaces, etc. (It also helps with ridership that the streetcar has free Wi-Fi.) This 2.2-mile “smart district” corridor even has street lights that dim when there are no pedestrians walking beneath.Real-time traffic feedback also makes concepts like “congestion pricing” a little easier to sell to consumers who are used to using roads for free. Instead of the typical toll for express lanes, this would change the pricing structure based on peak traffic times and for high-occupancy or exempt vehicles, with the goal of discouraging single-passenger drivers to be on the road at peak travel times.5. Tracking pedestrian trafficAddressing traffic congestion is also about understanding pedestrian traffic. In some cities, pedestrian traffic has been shown to be one of the main causes of traffic congestion in overcrowded areas. For example, the City of Las Vegas is using V2I technology to not only track how many vehicles go through a given intersection at different times, but how many pedestrians are crossing streets — and even jaywalking — so they can reroute vehicle traffic during high pedestrian traffic. The city can also get alerts when a pedestrian is in a roadway when the light is about to change, so they can delay the light if needed, increasing the safety of the streets.In Los Angeles, they’re stepping even further back to examine pedestrian traffic. They’re taking vehicle and pedestrian traffic data and making it open to the public, which means housing authorities and residential developers can better pinpoint commutes, and where housing should be developed to help reduce traffic coming into already congested neighborhoods.
6. Carsharing and multi-modal solutionsReports are not yet consistent on whether or not carsharing and ride hailing apps alleviate congestion. But either way, they provide alternative options. City planners and those in the public transit industry see it as an issue of connectivity — making it easy to grab a car through a private company’s app to head to a public transit station.Though not-yet implemented, the winner of the Department of Transportation’s Smart City Challenge, Columbus, Ohio, plans to invest into a trip planning app that would integrate its multiple modes of transportation and would also establish a single, streamlined payment system. Better connecting the modes of alternative transportation would encourage more urbanites to forego a car altogether. Read Jean Pilon-Bignell’s post on the Canadian Smart Cities Challenge.7. Replacing vehicles with dronesThere are some tasks done by city governments like checking water meters and utility lines that don’t necessarily need to be done by vehicle. With the emergence of IoT-equipped drone technology, utilities and public energy authorities are increasingly using drones to do these regular tasks instead of sending out field workers in a bucket truck. Los Angeles is even looking into drone technology to do things like firefighting.And of course companies are looking at drone technology to do inner-city tasks too, such as Amazon’s drone pilot program for short-distance deliveries. In fact, President Donald Trump signed an executive memorandum to make it easier for these types of companies to test drones in cities.

 There’s more holding back fully-autonomous vehicles than automotive technology. 
By Bryce Johnstone  
Last year, Elon Musk said 2020 would be the year we finally saw a fully-autonomous Tesla on the road. But bullish predictions like Musk’s don’t reflect reality – one where most companies and experts are rolling back their autonomous vehicle expectations.
Ultimately, fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) could be decades away because it’s not just about designing and manufacturing a vehicle. It’s about a whole ecosystem. As disappointing as it may be for some, it’s more realistic to be looking to 2035 for deployment of Level 5 autonomous vehicles.
The busy exec looking forward to maximizing their journey to work will have to keep waiting. But the wait will be worth it. We should appreciate that rushing to deliver autonomous vehicles just for the sake of it is in no one’s interest. Simply put, there is too much to risk.
While the race for the first fully autonomous vehicle continues, let’s take a closer look at three reasons why AV development is taking longer than predicted.
1.) Cities Need to Become Smarter
It can take several months or years to repair roads and bridges, and even longer to build new ones from scratch. On top of all the work involved in maintaining them, our roads must become as smart as the new autonomous vehicles that will pass over them every single day.
Faster cellular tech, such as 5G and the technology that follows it, are just one important component. The actual environment, including most roadways, must rely on Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) technology, which is still in development. This will require persistent connectivity between the vehicle and the road or city using Wi-Fi, dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), or other technology. All of this is still being developed, so even if AVs were ready to go today, automakers would still have to wait for the infrastructure to catch up. This is by no means a quick and easy task: Smart infrastructure will require the installation of millions of sensors across streetlights and traffic signals, as well as stop signs, construction notices, road exits, and much more.
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) connectivity is another essential feature, as it will one day enable vehicles to inform each other of upcoming traffic light changes, road hazards, accidents and traffic jams. Like most automotive technologies, V2V is still in its infancy.
The long-term benefits could be very significant, however, as smarter roadways allow for vehicles to travel more closely together and at equal speeds. This increase in efficiency could eliminate the need to expand roads with additional lanes, saving millions (if not billions) of dollars over many years.
2.) AVs Need to be Safer
Safety has always been the most important aspect of mobility, but it takes on a whole other dimension when cars drive themselves. By removing the need for a human driver, AVs will need to incorporate a plethora of sensors, such as LiDAR and radar. They will also have to utilize a vision system that can effectively see the road without human involvement. It’s a tall order, but it’s one that automotive OEMs are taking very seriously as they progress toward AV deployment.
Unlike other tech products, which might be rushed to market to meet deadlines, self-driving cars are on their own schedule due to the number of safety standards they must meet. It will take more than the millions of driven miles and billions of simulated miles to perfect the technology.
AVs must not only understand what should happen, but they must also be able to overcome all the challenges that could develop on any given road. Mudslides, rainstorms, snow, sleet, and hail are just the beginning. Any hazard or anomaly imaginable – falling boulders, objects that fall off trucks or overpasses, or forest fires that spread across roadways – must be considered. No car will be able to predict every possible incident, but AVs will need to understand and adapt to potential issues before they become a problem.
3.) Drivers Need to Accept AVs
It is widely understood that driver attitudes will shape the future of mobility as much as the technology itself. If consumers are unwilling to relinquish control, AV deployment could be slowed until drivers are persuaded.
According to the mounting body of evidence, when it comes to accepting automated transport a global divide remains between East and West. While the mass markets of Asia seem to have bought into self-driving vehicles, the more safety-conscious consumers of Europe and North America remain skeptical.
However, it is believed that consumer sentiment is slowly changing. SAE International, a global association for automotive engineers, found promising results after surveying approximately 1,400 consumers. The majority (82%) were “enthusiastic” about AVs before being given a test drive; roughly 10% reported higher enthusiasm after taking a driverless car for a spin.
Better still, 76% believed that the driverless car experience was on par or even better than a human-driven automobile. An additional 37% are convinced that driverless cars will reduce accident-related deaths when they debut. That’s an encouraging sign for an industry that is heavily focused on eliminating human error and, in the process, personal control of the vehicle.
Focusing on What Matters Most
These are just a few of the reasons why automakers are taking their time with AVs. It’s not about when they’ll be ready as much as it is how the many complex challenges associated with autonomous driving will be solved.
As OEMs rack up additional miles on real roads, test tracks, and in simulation, they will better understand what it will take to bring autonomy to the masses. And when AVs finally debut, consumers will be able to rest easy knowing that the cars were developed, engineered, and defined to meet their brief – a vehicle that can sense its environment and move safely with no human input.
Autonomous cars are too complex, and their occupants are too important, to rush the technology and deploy before it is truly ready. This is why the automotive industry is taking a cautious approach that will allow manufacturers, both big and small, to carefully develop the ultimate AVs. The end result will consist of cars that are safer, more capable and more convenient, paving the way for a genuine evolution in the future of mobility.

 Throughout history, futuristic autonomous vehicles have been featured in iconic movies and television shows as technology designed to assist. However, as this technology has evolved and the future of travel is decidedly pointing to autonomous services, there is still much debate on how the future of mobility and mass transportation will be impacted. 

For generations, autonomous vehicles have been seen as the de facto mode of transportation for the future. Time and time again, futuristic autonomous vehicles have been featured in iconic action movies, cartoons, and television shows as technology designed to assist either the superhero or star of the show. For example, in 1966, Adam West’s portrayal of Batman’s Batmobile included self-driving capabilities, inspiring many to wonder and speculate on what the self-driving future could look like. Those who are familiar with the cartoon “The Jetsons” will remember much of the show’s focus was on autonomous cars, shuttles, and similar technologies. However, as this technology has evolved and the future of travel is decidedly pointing to autonomous services, there is still much debate on how the future of mobility and mass transportation will evolve, and in what timeframe.
We believe that autonomous solutions represent one of the most transformational technologies we will see in a lifetime.
Disruption in the Industry
When it comes to autonomous mobility and its certain future, the term “disruption” often comes to mind. Driverless vehicles and fleets are the disruptors of the transportation industry, as we know it today. But the actual disruption is something that will happen over time. We’re still in the early stages of the evolution of this technology, however. Even the low speed, fixed course autonomous shuttle vehicles are in their infancy as true transportation solutions, with many of today’s deployments being “firsts” for a number of cities and communities. The initial, regulated deployments that are underway right now with these multi-passenger vehicles are advancing the testing and proof points of safe autonomous mobility, and, we believe, they will be a major contributor for driving the disruption that will ultimately result in the full-scale adoption of autonomous mobility solutions for public transportation, and eventually for personal transportation.
Realistic Timeframes
Beginning to deploy low-speed, geo-fenced autonomous vehicles and fleets, as an alternative to traditional mobility use cases, is paving the way for testing what a complete driverless environment could and would look like. Interacting with pedestrians, mixed traffic, and other surroundings are some of the important lessons to be gained from these deployments that will greatly advance the anywhere, anytime, any-speed autonomous services.
There are other important autonomous applications, such as farm equipment, highway trucking applications, package delivery, and industrial equipment, that are also important to the testing and perfecting of autonomy. Although most of the headlines today are about personal transportation, the impact for many businesses will also be substantial. 
For example, a report released by Bloomberg in May 2019 highlights a farmer who estimates he can save 80% on his farm chemical costs by using autonomous equipment. In the transportation of goods, labor represents a large percentage of the cost profile, which will be significantly impacted with autonomous solutions. There is plenty of motivation and positive impact to go around for businesses and consumers, however, a major challenge facing the autonomous technology revolution is managing realistic timeline expectations in the marketplace.
Several media publications suggest that the full widespread adoption of self-driving vehicles, buses, fleets, and public transportation is close, maybe even a couple years out. Although autonomous vehicles are being deployed around the world today in certain use cases such as the low-speed, fixed-route, geo-fenced routes, the full-scale adoption timeframe to ultimately realize true autonomous SAE level 5 deployments is a minimum of a decade away. 
There are also a significant number of opportunities to be addressed beyond just the vehicles themselves, such as cyber security, fleet orchestration and logistics, safety standards, infrastructure, transportation legislation, the customer experience, and more. All these areas are also evolving, making for stronger, more secure mobility solutions and a better autonomous customer transportation experience.
The Human Element and Safety
The first question consumers and legislators ask always revolves around safety. When a vehicle is autonomous, it is a fact that the vehicle does not see and interpret its surroundings today exactly as a human would, and therefore, it lacks a certain level of intuition.
 But, on the other hand, autonomous vehicles react to motion and events at a rate of two to three times faster than a human can, and the use of artificial intelligence will continually improve the needed interpretive logic. Most importantly, autonomous vehicles don’t get distracted by their surroundings or mobile devices. Human error and poor judgement are the leading causes of traffic accidents and deaths.
 There is plenty of research to validate that autonomous vehicles and equipment will dramatically improve safety in all applications. That being said, the immediate, safe-use cases, such as low-speed, fixed-route applications in a controlled environment, will be the guidepost for advancing into more complex, faster-speed applications and wider spread use in our communities and towns.
The Future of Mobility
Ultimately, safety will be the key determinant for the timeline of future deployments and expanded use of autonomous transportation solutions, and this will change the way people think about car ownership and public transportation. Today, we see autonomous fleets using this technology in the transportation of goods, farm equipment, maritime applications, and even package delivery.
 Each of these use cases are examples of where human intervention can be eliminated, and that’s where industry disruption is currently the most prevalent. What’s required to see the mass adoption of autonomous technologies that extend to all roads and highways is the ability to move from low-speed controlled environments safely into high-speed and more complex environments.
Another reality driving the transformation of mobility is the need to serve a new generation of riders. According to recent data released by Deloitte, millennials are less likely to purchase cars than past generations. The data states that 46% of millennials and Gen Z question the benefits of car ownership when rideshare is so easy.
 They also embrace new technology, making them well aligned with the future of autonomous vehicles. Widespread use of new transportation solutions will also help the baby boomer generation who may need additional help with transportation, especially for those who have difficulty driving. Connecting residents or constituents with various services through convenient and cost-effective mobility services will be an absolute requirement for attracting and retaining new residents and businesses to all communities.
The future of mobility is here today in the form of autonomous transportation, but it will continue to evolve over many years before we are able to experience the George Jetson effect. We believe that autonomous solutions represent one of the most transformational technologies we will see in a lifetime. The use cases will expand and extend into many new transportation services in the coming years to great benefit for businesses and consumers alike.

A mobile technology “arms race” is underway as companies re-imagine their supply chains, incorporate more mobility solutions into those networks, and work harder to future-proof their business models.
By Bridget McCrea 
Over the last few months, global supply chains have faced disruptions the likes of which most companies have never seen before.
Coming off of a year where labor shortages, an e-commerce boom, a shrinking pool of truck drivers, and trade wars were among their biggest challenges, shippers had a whole new set of issues hurled at them in early-2020.
With COVID-19 exacting a steep toll on human life, businesses, and livelihoods, some underlying supply chain issues became even more prominent. For example, e-commerce took off when people were at home or reluctant to shop at brick-and-mortar stores. Demand for buy online pick up in store (BOPIS) also accelerated, pushing retailers to get their collective “last-mile” and mobility acts together.
The good news is that the technology companies need to be able to operate efficiently in this “new normal” environment has been around for years. The not-so-good news is that many shippers were caught off guard by the pandemic and are now scrambling to implement solutions that help them gain better supply chain visibility and connectivity.
“The technology has always been there, but some companies are just further along and have been more innovative with it,” says David Krebs, executive vice president at VDC Research.
For example, COVID-19 accelerated the focus around driving visibility across operations and creating agile infrastructures. Combined, these two capabilities allow organizations to “more freely pivot,” says Krebs, “and leverage different fulfillment models.”
In response to market demand, technology vendors are introducing tools such as proximity solutions to alert workers when they’re not socially distancing—to the extent that this is even possible in certain work environments. “Education around disinfection best practices for shared technologies and devices has also been important,” Krebs points out. “The buzzword has clearly been ‘contactless,’ and we are seeing this pop up in all different scenarios and workflows—from delivery to point of sale.”
The connected fleet evolves
There was a time when shippers watched their goods leave their yards on a tractor trailer, lost visibility as they moved from point A to point B, and then picked visibility back up again when the trucks reached their final destination.
Fast forward to 2020 and the level of transportation visibility has vastly improved thanks to advancements in mobile technology. According to Bill Brooks, VP of Capgemini’s North American transportation portfolio, COVID has pushed more shippers to track their private and public fleets.
“COVID is basically driving a new norm as companies seek out ways to improve supply chain continuity in a safe manner that factors in everything that’s going on in our world right now,” says Brooks. “This trend is really going to take off over the next six to 18 months, with the connected fleet playing a huge part in that movement.”
Brooks sees data continuing to play a key role in supply chain mobility as companies focus on gathering, synthesizing, and utilizing their information. And while capturing and storing data is pretty straightforward, actually using it effectively isn’t always easy.
“As data continues to proliferate, companies have to do a better job of mining it, governing it, and getting it into the right hands at the right time,” says Brooks.
A multi-faceted animal, the connected fleet tracks everything from operational systems (i.e., preventative maintenance, hours of equipment usage, etc.), to accurate drive and ship times. It knows where any specific shipment is at all times and can convey that information back to the stakeholders who are asking for it.
More recently, companies have been incorporating elements of driver and employee safety into their connected fleets. If, for example, drivers know that they’re heading into a COVID hotspot, they can take the necessary precautions to help keep themselves, their shipments, or the end customer safe.
“The connected fleet takes a lot of those different elements and pulls them together onto a single platform,” says Brooks. “Technology vendors and shippers alike are getting innovative with their use of these connected fleets—versus just using them as pure tracking mechanisms.”
Today’s top mobility trends
According to VDC Research, overall investment in the warehousing space continues to grow and place pressure on optimized operations. The size and number of warehouses continue to rise, it says, as do the number of production and nonsupervisory employees in the warehouse along with their average hourly wages.
With 3.5 million warehouses currently operating globally, Krebs says the mobility trends taking place right now outside of their four walls include:
Decentralization of manufacturing capacity, with companies looking to bring production home. “This trend grew with the likes of automation and small batch production,” says Krebs.Global firms will diversify their supply chains in the future, instead of relying only on China. “Manufacturing hubs such as Vietnam, Mexico and India are likely to benefit from that shift,” he predicts.Traceability and serialization efforts to extend beyond pharmaceuticals and into fresh foods and other segments. For example, programs are being rolled out to match food service distributors with excess capacity food retailers and wholesalers that require additional resources.Continued capacity strain on last-mile delivery services. As more people shop from home, the “last-mile” simply can’t be a black hole in the supply chain anymore. Companies are using mobility solutions to gain visibility into this critical area.An accelerated push toward digital services and paperless processes. “This is also opening the door for example for blockchain solutions for supply chain,” says Krebs, “and especially in areas that have held centralized governance models.”Re-imagining forecasting algorithms and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to digitize inventory data. This trend accelerated when the global pandemic pushed the world’s supply chains and inventory stockpiles to their limits.Renewed focus on frontline workers. Ensuring the health and continuity of the food supply chain has shifted focus to a new class of “essential” workers. “As a result,” says Krebs, “supply chain security and workforce management are becoming ever more critical.”
Taking it to the air
Once considered something of a futuristic novelty, the airborne drone is proving its potential for the post-COVID, mobile supply chain—where contactless deliveries and social distancing are a normal part of our everyday lives.
Gartner predicts that by 2026, more than one million drones will be carrying out retail deliveries—up from 20,000 drones today. The global pandemic is a big driver of drone usage right now. For example, Zipline is using contactless drone delivery to transport COVID-19 test samples in remote locations across five African countries, and Chile recently launched a pilot drone program to deliver medications to people living in remote rural areas.
“The coronavirus pandemic has frozen much of the world’s aviation industry and grounded fleets,” Gartner states. “As a result, it has accelerated the use of autonomous flying drones in a humanitarian effort to beat the crisis.”
Beyond the pandemic, Gartner says that companies can consider autonomous flying drones as an opportunity to offer a premium service, like a fast-delivery option. For example, Spanish auto manufacturer SEAT uses drones to fly airbags and steering wheels from a supplier to its Martorell factory. A truck would take 90 minutes from order to delivery, but the drone can make it in just 15 minutes.
“Overall,” Gartner says, “the success of flying drone deliveries depends on a company’s ability to change its business model to make the most of the possibilities enabled by the technology.”
Get in the arms race now
Right now, the key requirement for supply chain operations is real-time visibility into operations and systems that can provide insight into capacity constraints across all supply tiers. This is often easier said than done, says Krebs, but it’s something shippers should be striving for.
Going forward, Krebs expects solutions that provide greater predictive intelligence to be in high demand, and especially solutions that can find patterns or indicate risk/opportunities. In addition, he says capacity strain on last-mile delivery is increasingly acute and an area of focus.
“Equipping essential frontline workers with the necessary digital and mobile tools to do their jobs and ensure worker safety are also areas where we see continued investment,” Krebs points out. “With e-commerce giants like Amazon continuing to build out their logistics infrastructure and becoming a more competitive threat to incumbents, we see a technology arms race developing.”
Getting in on that race will require an approach that thinks beyond what companies were doing just four or five years ago in this realm. Coming off an 11-year-long period of economic prosperity—and now re-imagining their business models for a post-COVID world—shippers are merging advanced technology tools with “lessons learned” to future-proof their supply chains.
“Embrace the change that’s coming and apply it to your new future and new norm,” Brooks advises. “In the end, it’s the companies that say: ‘Okay, if we do A, B and C we’ll be able to get out on the cutting edge,’ that will be more efficient, effective, and profitable.”

Mobility as a Service (MaaS) holds a lot of promise as a way to reduce the number of single occupancy vehicles on the road as well as address equity concerns. MaaS is a way to integrate different transportation options in order to facilitate coordinating trip and route planning, mode selection, and payment, according to Andy Boenau, leader of the MaaS initiative at engineering consulting firm Stantec.
Bicycles, scooters, on-call vans, and ride hailing apps, should be used to get people to and from major transit. A recent study from the American Public Transit Association (APTA) about MaaS in Europe , describes MaaS as “a full range of mobility options in a single digital mobility platform, leveraging public transportation as the network backbone.” Ideally, MaaS will eventually supersede personal cars in getting us “from any address in North America to any other address in North America,” said Boenau.
 Infrastructure that promotes transportation options such as a better bus system, conveniently located bikeshare and scooters, and walkability will make MaaS platforms more effective. Once fully operational, MaaS will provide the mobility and flexibility of an individual car without the expense, congestion and environmental impact.
This vision is different from the idea of autonomous vehicles on call to move each of us individually to all our destinations. A system with zero occupancy cars on the road that looks first to immediate, individual needs could induce more trips, sprawl, and congestion. Public transit can efficiently move large numbers of people and is a crucial element to include while working to achieve a sustainable transportation network.
Beyond level zero
How can different localities think about the implementation of Maas? A 2018 study by Jana Sochor et al. describes four levels of implementing MaaS. Level one includes multimodal planners, of which Google Maps is a rudimentary example; level two integrates booking and paying; level three has many layers, integrating a complete multimodal trip; and level four integrates policy goals, such as congestion charging. Sochor et al. point to “the need for decarbonization of the transport system, reduced congestion, innovation, and better accessibility” as important societal goals achieving a high level of MaaS will enable.
Most of North America is hovering around level zero, according to Chrissy Ditmore, Director of Strategy at Cubic Transportation Systems. Ditmore explained in a webinar that to move toward level one or two, the very first step for any transit agency is ensuring accurate real time information,. Simply having the scheduled time of arrival for a bus, for instance, won’t do, since if that bus is late it ruins the next step in the transit chain. It is also crucial to integrate with other agencies, such as metropolitan planning organizations, as transit agencies in isolation often lack the necessary authority. Public-private partnerships are also an important part of setting up a well-integrated MaaS system. Conversations between entities involved in MaaS need to happen as early as possible, as often as possible.
Two commonly discussed MaaS models are a monthly service charge for a full suite of services and a pay-as-you-go approach. The latter might incentivize customers to take the most efficient means of transportation, while a monthly fee might encourage overuse or the use of less efficient transportation choices. As a white paper by Cubic Transportation argues, “A pay-as-you-go model… is likely to encourage a more sustainable and denser use of transportation services.” The paper criticizes a subscription model as fundamentally flawed “given that the objective of MaaS must focus on improving the density of transit.”
Smart policy can also disincentivize single occupancy vehicle driving with a variety of tools such as “congestion pricing, parking regulation, land-use and traffic management policies,” according to a study of MaaS in Europe by the American Public Transit Association (APTA). For instance, according to the white paper by Cubic Transportation, governments “might charge the private operator for the privilege of using the road – a public asset – in pay-per-mile schemes.” Along with MaaS, such policies can lead to major changes in the way people choose to move around; individuals would pay for the unintended consequences of driving and this would fund more socially equitable and environmentally friendly alternatives.
Achieving transit equity
MaaS can end the isolation of those left out by our current dependence on individual vehicles. Seniors and young people are two groups without car access who would benefit greatly from MaaS, particularly as part of a complete, integrated transit system. Up to “26 percent of seniors don’t have a car and many avoid driving altogether due to disabilities or other physical limitations,” according to the Cubic white paper. A rural area with an aging population that had access to a complete and integrated transit system would have a much easier time connecting people which could have public health benefits.
The U.S. is behind many countries in making paying for various transit modes through a single smart phone app, according to Ditmore’s webinar on implementing MaaS, which makes it more difficult to move toward full MaaS. However, one area where the rest of the world does look to us is in designing for handicapped accessibility, as mandated by U.S. laws.
MaaS also needs to be designed for those who lack access to a smart phone, Ditmore said in the webinar on implementing MaaS. A single card linked to an account that could be refilled at different locations like a local 7-Eleven would be a useful and effective way to provide this service in the United States. Of course, getting the card to interface with different services, from bikeshare to rail, presents a technical problem, but a solvable one.
Arlington County is positioned to incorporate MaaS
Arlington has made important progress towards laying out the policy infrastructure for MaaS, and has long been at the forefront of transportation demand management (TDM). TDM means understanding travel behavior and decision-making, and providing information and guidance for people to use infrastructure in place for transit, walking, biking, and telework, which naturally encourages alternatives to driving and promotes better balance in the transportation system. “Arlington Transportation Partners has been working on that probably more than any like entity across the U.S.,” said Ditmore. For the past 20 years, “they were really at the cutting edge of how to plan in a different way how to incorporate demand.”
Arlington offers a variety of transportation options: walkable neighborhoods based around transit, a great local bus system, bus rapid transit, rail access, scooters and bike share. Residents also have an array of tools for finding the most convenient trip – by accessing real-time transit information through the WMATA Trip Planner or Google Maps to find the best route, or through the ART RealTime tool to know exactly when a bus will arrive. Residents also have at their disposal the ability to use the SmarTrip card to pay for bus or rail, and the Capital Bikeshare throughout the DMV.
Engineering a better future
MaaS may require a change in thinking for some policy makers and transportation officials and may also require some ingenuity and careful planning to facilitate its implementation. Andy Boenau has suggested that, “it’s challenging for city planners and traffic engineers to truly think about mobility as a service, because we’re so accustomed to intersection analysis and corridor studies.”
It’s reductive to think of MaaS as simply a better app, Ditmore said. Ditmore argued that MaaS has been packaged in a misleading way in the United States, that it is not primarily an app but a policy. Technology and sound policy are both needed to integrate different transportation options and to open up a world of mobility for all in clean, green cities.

  The Uber-like program will have store associates delivering packages on their way home from work. Will it work for Walmart? 
By Laura Heller 
Walmart store associates may be coming soon to shoppers’ doorsteps. 
Walmart announced earlier this month that it was testing a new delivery method — one that has store associates making deliveries on their way home from work. Marc Lore, president and CEO of Walmart U.S. e-commerce, pointed out on the company’s blog that 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart store. Product is already being delivered to stores and associates can sign up each day to take packages to their final destination and earn a little extra money.
“Walmart has strength in numbers with 4,700 stores across the U.S. and more than a million associates,” Lore said. “Now imagine all the routes our associates drive to and from work and the houses they pass along the way.”
While the program is currently being tested at three stores — two in New Jersey and one in Arkansas — the system is an example of how multichannel merchants can further leverage their installed store base to compete with Amazon, its network of distribution centers, and a growing fleet of delivery options.
“This effort provides Walmart with even more control over the last mile, which we believe is critical in retail, and remains an advantage for brick-and-mortar retailers as speed to the customer gains increasing importance,” Moody’s Lead Retail Analyst Charlie O’Shea told Retail Dive in an email.
But while Lore’s technology-based approach and Walmart’s many stores may be up to the challenge, it’s an extremely complex endeavor that doesn’t quite fit with Walmart’s longtime efficiencies in consumer goods distribution, which entails the customer taking care of that last mile. The program is either an ingenious attempt to address last-mile delivery problems — or terribly misguided, depending on who you talk to.
As rival retailers ponder how to compete with Amazon’s robust delivery infrastructure and make the most of their store footprints, the discussion forum RetailWire asked its BrainTrust panel of retail experts the following questions:
Do you see Walmart’s use of employees to make deliveries on their way home from work as a potential last mile game changer for the retailer?What do you see as the benefits and potential pitfalls of this program?
Here are eight of the most provocative and insightful comments from the discussion. Comments have been edited by Retail Dive for length and clarity.
1. Outside the box
Mark Ryski, Founder and CEO, HeadCount Corp.: I’m not sure if it will ultimately be a game-changer, but full points to Walmart for thinking about the delivery challenge in a completely new way. One of the big benefits is in providing employees an opportunity to earn additional income — essentially “Uberizing” employees’ commute home. Making the program voluntary is an important element of the program since not all employees will want to do this. And if this gets customers their deliveries sooner, that’s great too. Of course there are plenty of ways this could go wrong, but I’m sure Walmart will stress test the idea thoroughly before it gets too far. Overall, I think this is a great example of how innovation doesn’t always need to be just about technology.
2. Cheap and desperate
Ken Lonyai, Digital Innovation Strategist, Co-Founder, ScreenPlay InterActive: Walmart is not known for the happiest employees. Even with pay, I don’t think too many will openly embrace this idea. If they do, there are umpteen things that can go wrong with this idea that make it sound, to me, like a cheap and desperate move by management. Back to the drawing board guys.
3. Liabilities
Mel Kleiman, President, Humetrics: I am not a lawyer but all I see is a major liability problem for Walmart if one of those employees has an accident on the way to delivering an order. How are the workers going to be compensated for time and mileage?
4. Getting it right
Steve Montgomery, President, b2b Solutions, LLC: The concept sounds simple but as with many things the devil is in the details. An employee who is driving home from work is off the clock and no longer being paid by Walmart. However, if they are delivering packages for the company they would be eligible for compensation. If the time delivering the packages bumps them up to the number of hours to be considered full-time they would be eligible for the benefits that come with that status. If the delivery time took them over 40 hours, overtime would have to be paid. As an employee on the clock is Walmart still legally responsible for their actions?
Some other details would be: does the driver get paid mileage, who is responsible if they have an accident and what happens if the packages get damaged, stolen or lost in transit?
5. Innovative
Charles Dimov, Director of Marketing, OrderDynamics: Game changer — no. Innovative? Definitely. Kudos to Walmart for looking at ways to improve and strengthen their service offering while improving their margins. Presuming they will pay their employees a benefit for doing this last mile delivery, it is another great way to tap into their own resources to drive the holistic benefits of omnichannel retail.
In fact, at a time when so many retailers have been closing their physical presence, this type of out-of-the box thinking needs to happen more with retailers. This empowers employees to make a difference that can count in supporting the company and their important roles. Well done Walmart — keep surprising us!
6. Flashback
Art Suriano, CEO, The TSi Co.: Think back to the days of when in the ’50s and ’60s. We had the bread man, the milk man, the egg man and much more all making home deliveries. There was more than just a purchase of an item and payment; there was a relationship formed with the customer and the delivery person. I see the same benefit here with many of the store associates delivering items to customers. If they are well trained and engage with the customers they meet, this could be very beneficial for all parties involved. 
7. Returns too?
Ron Margulis, Manager Director, RAM Communications: One wonders if the employees will be picking up returns on their way to work.
8. What took so long?
Christopher P. Ramey, President, Affluent Insights & The Home Trust International: Independent and/or small businesses owners (and employees) have always delivered products “on the way home.” Why not? Employees will like it because they get out of the store earlier. They’ll also, if they carefully manage it, keep count on mileage for tax purposes. Management will enjoy leveraging a key differentiator: feet on the street to serve clients.
The only “ah-ha” to the strategy is why it took so long.

 This innovation will protect lives on the road and will work in tandem with visions for increasingly optimized delivery systems with fewer anticipated road casualties. 
By Olivia Vahsen
The first documented idea of an autonomous car was introduced in the New York World’s Fair in 1939 in the Futurama exhibit as part of General Motors’ vision of the future of America in 20 years. Nearly 70 years later, we are well on our way to an autonomous future with the goal of making driving safer and more efficient for all. In fact, scientists predict that self-driving cars will greatly reduce — if not completely eliminate — car accidents in the near future.
The main focus of autonomous driving has been about enabling driverless passenger cars, but as technology has advanced, the conversation has shifted from solving for the driver to talking about how autonomy can positively change the roads for freight trucks and fleet drivers as well.
There is a perfect storm that exists within advancements of autonomous trucking which makes the future of it both viable and attractive: easier routing, made even easier with advanced mapping systems of recent years (advancing more each quarter), and elimination of human error. 
Weathering road conditions
It’s no secret that truck drivers face long shifts on less than populated highways, often long into the evening or early morning; deliveries don’t sleep in locations far in the North, not even during the coldest, shortest days of the year. Large vehicles with these extensive loads, traveling long distances, have a large history of emergencies, unexpected issues, and mental and physical wear on the drivers who use them.
Trucks are heavier than passenger cars, contain loads of variable physical sizes and potentially unusual dimensions, making them hard to maneuver with today’s “standard” popular crash-avoidance and lane assistance software, and cannot be treated the same way during emergency stops. Sensors cannot be placed at the exact same locations to help with this process and must be adapted to the unique measurements of these vehicles.
And yet, all of these factors have not halted development, whether a truck needs to accommodate regular load transport at all times of day, at high speeds, or in moderate weather, with some of the most dangerous conditions soon underway. 
This suggests a safer, brighter future for the transportation industry, computers create reactions impossible for humans in the direst of circumstances. Developments like these prove to revolutionize one of the most heavily relied on, but simultaneously risk-heavy, industries.
The long road to autonomous adoption
Progress in recent months within autonomous trucking again tells us that companies have succeeded in creating trucks that can self-pilot across more substantial distances, with testing primarily in the Southwest. As these vehicles travel primarily on established, large freeways, routing becomes simple without adjusting for complex parking, traffic, and small city street dimensions.
The types of freeways present in these areas also raise a lot of questions in terms of adaptability, as trucking roads are not designed equal throughout the world.
While technology advances forward, there will inevitably be delays from the production of driverless trucks to their legal use on roads. What form this takes can splinter in countless directions for countless reasons; the purpose of the truck, in which specific state or region it is being used, perhaps even the views of the local population and their desire to share the road with autonomous systems of this size.
Ultimately, it may not be several years before widespread adoption, but the progress is still coming faster than many might expect. For some, this progress also comes at great personal concern —namely, the fate of truck drivers, who currently comprise 3.2 million workers in Europe alone.
Not phased out
Truck drivers have been at the root of concern of being at risk for redundancy, as self-driving capabilities in cars have increased to most commonly include driving on highways for more substantial stretches of time within their offerings. Several companies, such as Waymo and  Starsky Robotics, have logged countless driverless truck hours in the past years in familiar trucking territory.
Despite these advancements and concerns, there are many factors requiring human supervision which leaves many aspects of this job potentially secure.Trucks cannot, at this point, deliver their own maintenance, or respond to construction workers or police giving verbal commands. There is a level of human interaction that cannot be replicated by systems that do not have the communications functionalities separate from their self-driving technology.
Trucking into the next decade
While less popular in the public eye, autonomous long-range hauling is likely to evolve over the next several years as countries and companies decide how to integrate the new systems which look to disrupt a core industry in world transportation. 
This disruption can be seen as the best of both worlds — the optimization of safety and the promise of reduced job displacement. This innovation will protect lives on the road and will work in tandem with visions for increasingly optimized delivery systems with fewer anticipated road casualties.

A futuristic smart city, complete with intelligent cameras, autonomous vehicles and sensors galore, is closer than ever before – and cities that use smart technology stand to save money, improve public health and become hyper-efficient in their use of space.
Comcast Business recently convened a virtual panel of North Florida experts to discuss what it will take to create fully “smart” cities and what Florida cities have already done to make their communities smarter. Here are three key takeaways from the virtual event.
Connected ecosystems are a mix of different technology innovations
It will take a combination of technologies – including automated vehicle ecosystems, camera-monitored crosswalks and traffic lights, and sensors embedded in the ground – to truly create a smart space. These technologies generate and process a large amount of data that needs to move freely within a smart city ecosystem, so a strong data storage system and network for its transportation are equally as critical as the smart technology itself.
Still, smart cities are not created overnight. For already-established cities like Jacksonville, implementing technologies that can build on each other is a good way to get ongoing value from these systems. For example, smart metering programs have evolved so that municipal workers can read meters from a neighborhood’s entrance instead of walking around individual properties, which lowers liability risk and saves time and money.
The North Florida Smart Region Coalition’s entry for the Smart Cities Council’s Readiness Challenge included projects like autonomous vehicles and self-driving shuttles, dynamic stop lights that adjust to traffic conditions, as well as street lights that brighten as people pass by and dim again to conserve energy. With a consortium of more than 100 public agencies, nonprofits and businesses working to bring smart technologies to Jacksonville and St. Augustine, Florida, these concepts mark the beginning of a much broader effort.
Meanwhile, community spaces that are being built from the ground up present optimal opportunities for developers to incorporate smart city elements in original design plans, saving time and the hassle of retroactively trying to fit smart solutions into spaces with less flexible designs.
People are an equally critical element to the creation of smart cities
It will not just take new technologies and data storage to truly bring smart city ideology to fruition. As local businesses are reenergized and community spaces change design, key stakeholders in the community will play a critical role. Cities that partner with local technology companies to develop and implement smart solutions are often at an advantage, because these companies are nimbler and have more immediate access to innovative solutions than a city would on its own.
For example, a local startup recently developed an AI machine learning program for smart phones that can track important road data like potholes in real-time, which in turn helped conserve public budget for road maintenance.
Smart cities create a digital connective tissue in communities, but it is important to develop infrastructure platforms that reinforce human connections. Implemented correctly, these solutions can not only improve profit margins for cities, but also solve very real problems in communities, including rush hour traffic backups, pedestrian fatalities and timely health care delivery.
Cities looking to implement smart technology should first convene public forums to hear from community members on how certain technologies will be received, and if there are any barriers for implementation. And, with the recent rise in online meeting spaces, these forums are now easier than ever to schedule and attract community members to.
Remember digital deserts when developing smart cities
Even though smart city innovations are already being explored and implemented, an area cannot call itself fully “connected” until its digital deserts have been included as well. Digital deserts are typically underserved communities with poor to no access to network connectivity, something that is even more critical to the average household following shelter-in-place orders brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.
It has become clear that broadband is an essential service, just as much as water and electricity are. Planning a new community with smart technologies built in from the ground up is certainly a best practice for design, but these types of projects are more likely to happen in communities that can afford that infrastructure. Meanwhile, low-income community members often don’t have the option to connect to the internet and work from home, making it harder for these working professionals to learn new skills or apply for jobs and for their children to fully participate in remote learning opportunities and virtual classes.
In the face of the ongoing pandemic and ever-changing development cycles, scaling and urban planning will be key to creating smart cities without digital deserts. Developers and community leaders should take this opportunity to invest in technologies that make their entire communities safer and smarter.

Artificial intelligence (AI) lab Fetch.ai and blockchain firm Datarella have launched a pilot project in Munich, Germany, called M-Zone, which will focus on using AI-powered software agents to better optimize smart parking.
Smart parking has become an increasingly important part of enabling smart infrastructure for the greater whole of smart cities. Smart parking helps to fit more vehicles into appropriate spaces without the intervention of human drivers. Optimizing parking spaces will allow for better organization of traffic flow and help to prevent traffic jams.
The Fetch.ai and Datarella trial will use public transportation through a tokenized incentive system while reducing congestion that contributes to CO2 emissions.
“Parking is one part of a bigger mobility picture, but in our view a cornerstone one,” Humayun Sheikh, CEO of Fetch.ai told Electronics360. “Up to one-fourth of cars on the road in cities are looking for a parking space, so it has a huge impact on transportation infrastructure.”
Sheikh said that multi-agent systems running on a decentralized network help to coordinate complex tasks between multiple vehicles that have not been previously possible. The goal is to take people who are driving everyday and nudge them toward less intensive usage of the car park.
“We hope to be able to significantly reduce the amount of CO2 being released and ultimately provide the city of Munich with a sustainable option for an otherwise congested city center,” Sheikh said.
How it works
The AI-powered blockchain technology allows businesses to deploy autonomous economic agents (AEA), intelligent programs that are built with pre-defined goals and skills — from simple conditional logic to advanced deep and reinforcement learning models. The system is integrated into building infrastructure where cameras with machine vision log the vehicles as they enter a parking structure as well as the vehicles’ position. A smartphone app is then used to receive incentives.
M-Zone will solve the needs of the smart city by:
Saving time and money and reducing commuter and driver stress.Simplifying approval for new development projects for property owners.Lowering rent by sharing dynamic parking spots.Optimizing traffic flows in cities.Lessening the negative effects of CO2.
The reward system will help to incentivize drivers to reduce the number of car trips to the Connex Buildings and corporate offices as measured by the utilization of parking spaces.
 Each registered user that uses the car park will be awarded with a certain number of tokens per minute for not parking in the parking lot. As soon as a car or its wallet address is registered as parked by the Carpark app, the token airdrops to the wallet. The number of tokens rewarded per wallet and minute depends on the current utilization of the parking lot.
“Individuals are incentivized to use public transport by being rewarded with digital coins in their wallets,” Sheikh said. “We will be using FET tokens to incentivize the behaviors associated with the M-Zone trial, but longer-term any token could be used for the incentive.”
More pilots to come
The pilot smart parking project will launch in Munich’s Connex Buildings and aims to scale up in 2021 both in Munich and in other locations. The next steps are to run a larger project for the IAA Mobility 2021 trade show, taking place in September of next year, which will run city-wide.
Sheikh said the M-Zone trial is part of the first program Fetch.ai plans to conduct in the coming months in several industry verticals including the hospitality and mobility sectors.
The Fetch.ai and Datarella smart parking initiative is one of several pilot projects that have been announced worldwide to test automated driving capabilities inside parking structures.
Human Horizons is working on a valet service in Shanghai, China, using lidar, radar and communication devices in parking areas to identify and track vehicles and obstacles inside a parking structure. A different valet system project is taking place in the automotive core of Detroit. In this project, Ford, Bosch and parking vendor Bedrock said the automated valet could save the same amount of space to yield about 20% more vehicles inside a parking structure. 
Cornell University has created smart parking software to match drivers with parking garage spots in order to help reduce congestion and emissions while saving drivers the time spent finding spots.

U.S. transit ridership has been on the decline in recent years, with industry experts offering a number of reasons for the trend. Among them: relatively stable gas prices; an improving economy enabling more people to own cars; transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft attracting customers who otherwise might take transit; and public frustration with train and bus services not running on time.
Last year, transit ridership dropped 2.9 percent to 10.1 billion trips compared with ridership in 2016, which was down 3.1 percent compared with 2015, according to the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). Although much of the ridership dip occurred on bus services, rail ridership also took a hit. In 2017, U.S. heavy-rail ridership fell 2 percent to 3.8 billion trips, while commuter- and light-rail figures slipped 0.19 percent and 0.83 percent, respectively, APTA reported. Those decreases occurred even as several U.S. cities opened new light- and commuter-rail lines, built extensions and launched streetcar routes.
The impact of TNCs on transit ridership was cited as a key factor in a recent New York City Economic Development Corp. (NYCEDC) report on the decline of bus and subway ridership in New York City. While ridership was down, car driving — fueled in part by app-based services — is increasing, according to the New York Post’s report on the NYCEDC’s assessment.
“Growth in subway ridership began to fall as app-based companies took to the streets. This trend is especially apparent after lower-cost ride sharing services, including Via and UberPOOL, launched in the city,” the NCEDC stated. “Uber, Lyft, Via, Juno and Gett provided roughly 93 million trips in 2016, up from 41 million in 2015.”
Competition or collaboration?
The popularity of TNCs — as well as the potential for autonomous vehicles to transport people more efficiently — has led some transportation industry observers to predict that mass transit ridership will only continue to fall.
Of course, APTA officials and transit industry executives don’t see it that way. If anything, the Ubers and Lyfts of the world have helped push agencies into a bigger-picture conversation about how they’ll serve as the go-to manager of passengers’ day-to-day transportation options and needs.
For the past several years, U.S. transit agencies have been grappling with the “first-mile, last-mile” challenge — that is, helping riders travel that short distance to or from a train station or bus stop. To help close that transportation gap, agencies have adopted a number of strategies, such as partnering with Uber and Lyft to subsidize transit riders who use those services to get to and from stations. 
Agencies also made it easier for riders to bring bicycles and skateboards on board trains and buses; launched their own bike-share programs; installed easier-to-follow signage directing pedestrians to transit stations; and created neighborhood shuttle or van services to pick up riders at their doorsteps.
Next step: Manage mobility
Moreover, many agencies are embracing the concept of “mobility management” — designing or providing transportation that begins and ends with the rider, according to APTA. Agency execs say mobility management is the next step in solving the first-and-last-mile dilemma.
“Transit agencies across the country are focused on their next step in the overall progression of being isolated agencies and more toward this mobility management role,” says Ben Limmer, assistant general manager at Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA). “They’re really trying to get customers to the most effective mobility option in real time in order to make their trip to and from wherever that might be.”
A recent report by mobile ticketing and software company Masabi illustrates why transit agencies should work in partnership with TNCs and other entities to address passengers’ daily transportation needs. In a survey of more than 1,000 U.S. residents with access to public transit services, the firm found that:
• 70 percent of respondents drive themselves on at least a weekly basis;• 40 percent never use public transit despite having access to it;• Convenience is the top motivator for passengers who choose to ride transit;• 35 percent of respondents combine ride-sharing with public transit at least occasionally;• 7 percent of respondents combine ride-sharing with public transit at least weekly;• Up to 25 percent of potential riders said convenience features — such as combining transit modes through an app, mobile ticketing and location tracking — would cause or have caused them to use public transit service more often; and• 95 percent of weekly rideshare customers use public transit, which researchers suggest points to a future of reduced car ownership in favor of public/private urban mobility options.
“By implementing the types of convenience features found in ridesharing and other transportation alternatives and integrating multiple transit modes to deliver full first-last mile mobility, the emerging mobility ecosystem is set to provide a viable alternative to car ownership,” said Masabi CEO Brian Zanghi in a press release. “Getting there, however, will require public/private partnerships between the agencies and mobility services that Americans already depend on every day.”
For its part, MARTA has been “very busy” figuring out how to provide safe and efficient first-and-last mile connections, according to Limmer.
MARTA has been improving way-finding initiatives for pedestrians and motor vehicle drivers; installing ADA-compliant pedestrian infrastructure; and creating a bicycle infrastructure to connect to the transit system, he says. For example, MARTA cooperates with the city’s initiative to make Atlanta a friendly place for bike riders. In 2017, the agency completed a partnership with the city to install Relay Bike Share kiosks at 16 MARTA rail stations. Plans call for MARTA to expand Relay to rail stations outside the city, says Limmer. “We’ve done a partnership with bikeshare organizations and car-share companies. And we work with a lot of what I call hyper-local transit organizations; these are focused on private buses or shuttles that take patrons to and from MARTA bus and rail systems,” he says.
One click, one pay, one journey
In the future, MARTA plans to launch a new “MARTA On the Go” app that will provide riders a one-stop source for information and choices for their mobility options. The agency is beta-testing the technology, which would enable riders to use the app to plan, book and pay for their entire journey starting from their homes, Limmer says.
Combining technology with the plethora of mobility options is how transit agencies will evolve in the future, Limmer believes.
“That’s really where we see transit agencies going — toward being mobility managers,” he says. “More specifically, they’ll be migrating toward a one call, one click, one play, one pay transportation network overall. You’ll be able to use the same app to make a variety of trips.”
Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) has been applying a comprehensive approach to its first-and-last-mile predicament. In 2014, Metro adopted a first-last mile strategy and guidelines calling for infrastructure improvements that create “easy, safe and efficient access” to Metro stations and stops. In 2015, the agency’s first-and-last-mile guidelines won a national planning excellence award for a best practice from the American Planning Association.
“At its core, the strategic plan is a planning method, so it allows us to look at any location, station or bus stop, figure out the difficulties that our passengers are encountering and proceed toward improving those conditions,” says Jacob Lieb, senior director of Metro’s first-and-last-mile planning.
Many transit users live close enough to get to the Metro system by foot or bike, skateboard, scooter, skates or wheelchair. However, they may face challenges getting there, such as long blocks, freeways to cross, broken sidewalks and safety concerns. As a result, many of Metro’s first-and-last-mile efforts have involved planned improvements to streetscapes, sidewalks, crosswalks and signals, as well as adding wayfinding signage, bike lanes and lighting near and around stations. Planning is underway to improve existing stations, while station-access issues are being addressed in all new transit development plans.
Other elements in the first-and-last-mile “toolbox” include Metro’s own bike share program that it operates in Los Angeles, Venice and Pasadena — with more locations to come. And later this year, the agency will launch a microtransit pilot project that will offer shuttle bus or an “Uber-type” curb-to-curb service, says Metro spokesman Rick Jager.
The results of an annual ridership survey will help the agency determine what else to put in the toolbox, says Lieb. Metro also is researching why people living in a metropolitan area known for motor vehicle gridlock are not using the local transit system. (Rail ridership has grown as the agency has opened new lines; it’s primarily the bus service that has declined, Metro officials say.) For example: Are they not riding because getting to a station is difficult and, if yes, how so?
Ultimately, tackling Metro’s first-and-last-mile challenges will require tighter relationships between the agency and the neighborhoods where transit stations are located.
Metro planners learned that lesson earlier this year when they used the agency’s new strategic plan to conduct a comprehensive study of first-and-last-mile issues on the Blue Line, the system’s oldest rail route. The 22-mile light-rail line runs between Los Angeles and and Long Beach.
“The Blue Line travels through heavily low income and transit-dependent communities, and has the most challenging existing conditions in terms of safety and access around the stations, particularly because it’s sharing space in the corridor with goods and freight movements,” says Lieb.
Cast a wide net for solutions
Metro’s planning team cast a wide net to come up with solutions for improving access to each station, as well as proposing improvements in neighborhoods via transit-oriented development. The entire Blue Line effort could result in up to $1 billion in potential investment, according to Lieb.
The team partnered with community-based organizations (CBOs) to help ascertain first-and-last-mile challenges and needed infrastructure improvements along the line. The report, which came out in March, features recommendations specific to each station and its community.
Efforts to draw up the plan included walk “audits” of neighborhoods, as well as discussion groups that addressed neighborhood issues such as redlining, gentrification, policing and security.

“By [its] very nature, first-last mile infrastructure can be the most neighborhood oriented element of a transportation system that a person uses,” the final report states. “As a consequence, identifying first-last mile challenges and improvements becomes part of a much larger canvas of how a community defines its character. And that means the community needs to be engaged in early first-last mile planning, and the actual implementation of a plan’s recommendations.”
Lieb says working directly with CBOs and neighborhood groups to dig deeper into issues that define their communities gave Metro planners a “different perspective” from what the agency has done in the past to address station-specific problems.
“Our real point of emphasis is to expand our sphere of interest into the public right-of-way around our stations,” he says. “And what we’ve seen to this point is pretty great enthusiasm from the jurisdictions in wanting to maximize the value of transit stations in their cities, and in working with transit agencies to improve their streets.”

 One of the most persistent issues transit and transportation planners face is how to move their populations a mile or two. A few miles are often all that separates a rider’s front door from a transit stop; or the distance from a transit stop to an office. 
One of the most persistent issues transit and transportation planners face is how to move their populations a mile or two. A few miles are often all that separates a rider’s front door from a transit stop; or the distance from a transit stop to an office. It’s the dreaded “first-mile/last-mile” conundrum. And it often means the difference between taking the train or bus into work, or driving the car, often unaccompanied, and contributing to increasingly congested highways and growing greenhouse gas emissions. 
According to the American Public Transportation Association, every dollar invested in public transportation brings four times that in economic impact. So while it’s true that transit agencies tend to require investments that aren’t repaid in fares, an effective transit system does contribute to the economic vitality of a community.
Transit agencies large and small have launched many efforts to attract riders by making those first- and last-mile trips easier. It has often meant partnering with a private-sector transportation provider like Via or a transportation network company like Lyft or, increasingly, a bike- or scooter-share operator.
Just over a year ago, transit agencies in Los Angeles and Seattle launched partnerships with Via, a provider of on-demand, shared transit. Riders engage with the service much like they would a ride-hailing app, while folks without access to a smartphone can dial a call center for service. The pilot programs were funded by the Federal Transit Administration.
In Los Angeles, the pilot covered service to three distinct zones, with each ride starting or ending at transit stations within the service zones. One of the larger overarching missions for officials at L.A. Metro, the region’s transit agency, was reducing single-occupancy trips.

“If we’re doing that — and this certainly can contribute to that — we’re getting more people who used to travel alone to use alternative means,” said Joshua Schank, chief innovation officer for L.A. Metro. “And our initial data indicates that we are.
“A lot of people who were driving alone and parking at stations are saying they’re using this,” Schank added. “A lot of people who used to have a more cumbersome and long, challenging ride to stations are using this. Those are the types of metrics that we are looking at.
“Now, the question is, at some point, is it worth the amount of money we’re spending to get those outcomes? And, from our perspective, this has been a real win on that front,” Schank continued. “Because we’ve been coming in under budget. We have a partner that’s been very flexible, that has tried to accommodate what we’re trying to accomplish and really wants to work with us to meet those goals.”
Ridership has grown from week to week, with only 100 to 200 rides per week in the initial few weeks. As word of the service spread, however, ridership picked up to 3,500 rides a week prior to the slowdown brought on by the novel coronavirus, which took ridership down to 1,300 rides a week. Riders don’t pay when boarding, but instead pay their fare when transferring onto a connecting bus or train.
“It’s taken a while for word-of-mouth to get around, for people to know about the service. It definitely took time to grow that ridership. But it has been going up and up,” said Marie Sullivan, project manager for the mobility-on-demand pilot project. The program has expanded to now serve 10 Metro stations.
In Seattle, transit officials organized a similar year-long pilot with Via, connecting riders to five light rail stations. The pilot concluded near the end of March.
“The idea was to test the use of a transportation network company to provide first- and last-mile service, to make it easier for people to access our transit system, and to expand the access of those transportation network companies to populations who historically have been left out of being able to use on-demand services,” explained Casey Gifford, Innovative Mobility project manager for King County Metro.
The city of Seattle expressed interest in the project and contributed funding to expand its scope. Four of the five transit stops served by the on-demand service were located in Seattle, offering seven-day service at those four stations, 5 a.m. to 1 a.m., correlating with the service hours of the light rail system.
Ridership mostly followed the peak service seen during morning and afternoon commutes on the light rail system, and totaled about 1,000 rides per weekday.
“We also have a lot of youth who take advantage of the service. They’re using it to get to school, and get to jobs, and get to recreational opportunities.”

School-age riders also turned out to be frequent users of an on-demand shared transit program launched in Cupertino, Calif., in November 2019 as part of an 18-month pilot program, again using Via as the service provider.
“Generally, the community has been really supportive and happy with the program. The data we’re getting is really interesting. I think we went into this assuming it would be more something seniors would take advantage of, and maybe not the rest of the community as much. We’re seeing a really broad usage pattern,” said Chris Corrao, senior transportation planner in Cupertino, adding that a number of users of the program are turning out to be high-school-age riders who may use the service to get home from school or to afterschool events.
“Usually for these kinds of programs, you get the huge morning and afternoon peaks, and then sometimes quiet during the day,” said Corrao. “And we’re not seeing that at all. It’s just kind of busy all day, which is great. It’s expensive to run, so we want to make sure it’s as used as possible.”
The goal of the projects is to “leverage the transit infrastructure that these transit agencies have already built, and help bring more people to transit,” said Obinna Emenike, general manager of partners at Via, speaking during a panel discussion at the CoMotion LA conference last fall in downtown Los Angeles.
“Both of the services have been a success,” Emenike said of the projects in Los Angeles and Seattle. “I think we’ve hit every single one of the KPIs [key performance indicators] that we laid out, and the service continues to grow.”
Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority (CapMetro) in Austin, Texas, also partnered with Via to launch a new on-demand service now available in six zones, an expansion from one area back when the service was piloted two years ago. The expansion was due, in part, to the elimination of some of the fixed-route bus service following a system redesign, said Tony Lynch, supervisor of the Demand Response Planning department at CapMetro.
“Our Board of Directors requested that where we removed fixed-route, we have an alternative service,” said Lynch. “We determined Pickup was the best option for these locations. Each zone must have access to grocery stores and frequent fixed-route transit at a minimum.”
Ridership has grown since August last year, when it hovered around 80 to 100 riders a day, to 400 to 500 a day — or sometimes slightly more — by February. It has slipped significantly since service was adjusted for the coronavirus response.
The service is designed to both connect riders with regular, fixed-route transit and offer transit within the service zone.
“We determined that the zones must have trip generators like grocery, retail, post office, parks and connections to frequent bus service,” said Lynch. “Initially it looks like the majority of trips are taken to grocery stores and connecting to other transit. Of course, some customers use the service to visit friends and family who live within a particular Pickup zone.”

Not all public-private transit partnerships are formed with traditional transit. The service created in Cupertino is an example seen in a growing collection of small communities — the Silicon Valley city, home to Apple headquarters, has about 60,000 residents — where on-demand transit is the only option.
Cupertino will contribute about $1.2 million for its shuttle service.
“Which is no small amount,” said Corrao, “but it is significantly less than running a full community shuttle.”
In some cases, such as a proposal in Wilson, N.C. (pop. 50,000), communities are contemplating abandoning existing fixed-route transit service.
The city council in Wilson is considering a proposal to replace fixed-route transit service with an on-demand system operated by Via.
“It is very difficult to operate an efficient transit system without the economies of scale found in metropolitan areas, which is one reason most cities of our size do not provide public transportation,” said Grant Goings, city manager for Wilson, in a statement. “For years we have been looking for a technology-based solution that would increase our levels of service to the citizens while containing costs. We believe this public-private partnership provides such an opportunity.”
Other partnerships have formed between transit agencies and transportation network companies (TNCs) like Lyft or Uber. The Transportation Authority for Marin County, Calif., launched a program three years ago to provide up to a $5 per ride credit for users of the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART), a newly launched commuter rail service for the area north of San Francisco. The program was expanded this year to include two new SMART stations in an effort to grow ridership on the train as well as reduce congestion and air pollution.
Another pilot program that involved a partnership with both Lyft and Via to get riders to light rail stops in the Denver metro area in 2016 was ultimately discontinued due to the high cost of providing service that complied with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Officials say measuring success for these programs — and continuing their operation — is based on a number of factors. And the coronavirus crisis represents the newest curve ball thrown at transit.
“We’re still working with our partners to determine what’s going to happen,” said Gifford at King County Metro, in an interview in early April. The future is less sure given “the new wave of uncertainty that’s come upon us pretty rapidly,” she added.
In Cupertino, ridership data from March and April showed that most users were no longer using the service to get to school or connecting to Caltrain stations like they had been.
“Now, all of our trips are, like, to Target and Whole Foods,” said Corrao.
“We almost considered pausing the program,” due to low ridership, he added. “But we decided, if people are using it, even if it’s a lot less, then we want to have the option for them.”
The city and Via have suspended shared rides in order to maintain physical distancing requirements.
In Los Angeles, Schank said Metro plans to explore other on-demand transit opportunities.
“Our partner remains the people who need it most,” he said plainly. “So that is always what we’re going to be looking for. Where are the places where first- and last-mile options are not great? And we’ve got economically disadvantaged communities we can serve.”
What the new era brought on by the coronavirus has demonstrated is the benefits of a system quick to respond to by-the-moment changes, said Sullivan.
“One thing that service has been able to show, in the midst of this crisis, is flexibility that is inherent in the service model,” she remarked.
In Seattle, ridership numbers are but one metric, said Gifford.
“We’re also looking at who is riding. And equity is one of our core components, or core goals, at King County Metro.”
One of the goals of the program was to serve disadvantaged communities as well as to ensure the service was accessible for riders of all abilities.
“We are also looking at sustainability and the safety of the service,” said Gifford, adding, “ultimately, we’re going to have to take into account the financial situation.”
And of course, all transit agencies are exploring any number of partnerships.
“We’re all about innovating and testing new ways to facilitate access to mobility for our customers,” said Gifford. “And we’re really excited to have more tools in our toolbox for us to leverage. We know that a 40-foot bus is not always going to meet the needs of all of our users, so we are all about testing a range of different mobility options for different populations, for different contexts, to see what works best for each community.”

THERE IS A LOT OF HYPE around 5G but none of it is new. We saw the same propaganda – fuelled by the manufacturers – in the run-up to the launch of the 3G and 4G versions of the mobile technology.
Driverless cars and a range of other internet of things (IoT) applications can indeed potentially open new revenue streams. The reality, however, is that these markets might not eventuate until somewhere between 2025 and 2030. The reason for this is that many of these developments have little to do with technology. They depend far more on radical changes in society and the economy. This means that it is more likely we will see any large-scale implementation of such services over decades rather than years.
Obviously, there will be some low-hanging fruit when the 5G network is rolled out and starts covering larger parts of the country, but also this development will take many years.
Take, for example, autonomous cars and consider this — for that technology to work, a very large part of the road infrastructure will need to be covered by 5G. This would require a 5G antenna every 200 metres along those roads. In Europe, the telecoms operators have argued that if this is to happen car manufacturers will have to assist in such an investment. To date, there has been little or no interest from them in co-funding such infrastructure.
Apart from those logistics, the 5G technology would have to be extended with mm-wave technology and that would require new spectrum that has not yet been allocated. There are also questions regarding health safety that still haven’t been answered.
So, what is in it for the operators in the meantime? Basically, greater network efficiencies and extra capacity, at incremental costs. No new revenues but lower costs. It will also provide more backhaul capacity. This makes the operators less dependent on the fixed copper networks for their backhaul requirements.
In the heavily concentrated telecoms market in the USA, we also might see that carriers such as Verizon and AT&T will force users of the fixed copper network onto their 5G mobile networks, most likely at higher costs to the users and at lower costs to the operators. By doing so, they will hope to avoid rolling out fibre networks deeper into the market. Without any serious competition and regulatory oversight, they might well be able to get away with this. With competition declining in general, it will be tempting for operators in other countries to replicate such strategies.
It is, however, interesting to contemplate 5G as an infrastructure technology being applied by fibre network operators (FTT-5G). Rather than bringing fibre all the way to the home, can it be used to provide customers access for the last few hundred metres to this through 5G? If this is a reality (bringing fibre to every 5G cell/tower), then we could see massive cost savings on the consumer access end of the network.
In countries with poor network quality, we could see the lower end of the broadband market moving to mobile-only solutions. Of course, this only works in areas where 5G will be made available. However, bear in mind that a full rollout could take five-to-ten years. Unfortunately, those in already poor fixed broadband parts of regional and rural areas are not going to get 5G anytime soon. The reality being that initial networks will be predominantly rolled out in metro and urban areas.
Another observation here is that there is a ban in place on Huawei 5G equipment in the USA and Australia. These two countries will be at a disadvantage, as this Chinese company is the global leader in 5G, both in relation to innovation and price/performance. This will give all those 5G operators in countries that don’t have the Huawei ban a great advantage over those in America and Australia. The political ban could hamper innovations specifically in the area of IoT.
This could be seriously detrimental to technical innovation in the USA, as this country no longer has its own national telecoms infrastructure manufacturing industry. It might be less relevant to Australia as this country is not a technology leader, just a follower. The lack of innovation in Australia was recently lamented by David Thodey, Chair of CSIRO and Jobs for NSW and former CEO of Telstra and IBM ANZ.
5G equipment itself is only part of the overall costs of the 5G rollout. The fact that the other manufacturers are roughly one-third more expensive than Huawei will also affect the actual price that consumers will have to pay.
Don’t expect 5G miracles to happen any time soon. Initially, it will be a network efficiency play mainly about network efficiency and very few users will notice much change. As far as exciting new services are concerned nothing significant is going to happen in the next few years. Nevertheless, over the longer term, 5G will be an exciting new technology that will most certainly lead to a large range of new innovations and new developments in the telecoms market.

It’s no secret that Los Angeles is notorious for its traffic jams, typically ranking first in studies of the nation’s traffic hot spots. Estimates suggest that Angelinos spend an extra 120 hours a year stuck in them. While a nightmare for drivers, the L.A. transportation system does have its advantages if you’re devising a new system to quickly predict and potentially redirect that traffic.
Researchers from across the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory set out to do just that under the umbrella of a larger project on the design and planning of mobility systems led by collaborators at DOE’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).
Using an artificial intelligence (AI) technique called machine learning, the team leveraged Argonne’s supercomputers to digest traffic patterns from nearly a year’s worth of data taken from 11,160 sensors along the large California highway system. That information was then used to train a model to forecast traffic at lightning fast speeds—certainly faster than L.A. traffic. Within milliseconds, the model can look at the past hour of data and predict the next hour of traffic with great accuracy.
Working with members of Argonne’s Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) division and the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), a DOE Office of Science User Facility, the team achieved exceptional results in traffic forecasting, recently publishing those results in Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board.
“The AI and supercomputing capabilities that have been used in this work allow us to tackle really large problems,” said Prasanna Balaprakash, a computer scientist in MCS with a joint appointment in the ALCF. “The scale of this project is large, and this amount of data requires an equally large computing resource to tackle it.”
Using ALCF’s world-class computing resources, the scientists drastically reduced the number of computer hours needed to train the model. For example, where it might take a top-of-the-line desktop computer a week to train the traffic forecasting model, the same process can be done in three hours on a supercomputer.
Harnessing the power of graph-based deep learning—a complex form of machine learning that can make decisions and improve a model’s predictions almost automatically—their model uses historical data to predict traffic patterns, while forecasting speed and flow at the same time. This is important because traffic flows in one area at any given time depend upon the speed and flow of traffic nearby.
“Traffic forecasting approaches are critical to developing adaptive strategies for transportation,” said Eric Rask, a former principal research engineer with Argonne’s Center for Transportation Research and one of the scientists involved in the study. “Traffic patterns have complex spatial and temporal dependencies that make accurate forecasting on large highway networks a challenging task.”
Not only did the team capture those dynamics, they accomplished it on a network with dramatically more sensors and prediction locations than previous traffic forecasting models, Rask noted. And by breaking the large network into a number of smaller ones, they were able to train each portion of the network independently, greatly increasing the speed and effectiveness of the model.
Previous models could handle data from only 200-300 sensor locations; but with this new graph-partitioning method, the team was able to process data from over 11,000 locations while reducing the model training time by an order of magnitude. This method was not only fast, it could accurately predict the speed of traffic an hour into the future, typically within 6 mph of the observed speed at any location across the network.
“The scale and accuracy of the forecasting techniques have the potential to enable better decision making,” said Tanwi Mallick, a postdoctoral appointee in MCS and first author on the project.
Mallick and her colleagues believe the model can be readily integrated into traffic management centers, providing traffic controllers a better means by which to react to and address traffic jams and reroute traffic accordingly.

With a pandemic gripping our world right now, busy roads seem like a thing of the past. That is, however, hardly true. As soon as life starts getting back on track, traffic congestion will be back in full force, and city governments will struggle immeasurably with traffic management. Urban areas, both big and small, will return to day-long traffic jams and significantly longer commute times.
 Such problems affect the ordinary citizen the most, and every city looking to turn smart must first tackle them. Here are some truly “smart” ways to fight to overcrowd and reduce traffic congestion with smart city tech in urban areas. These apply to cities of all sizes and have already been employed successfully by many city governments.
Traffic Light Optimization
Smart programming and digitization can be used to control traffic light operations in both large and small urban areas. When traffic lights co-ordinate ideally and respond to demand in real-time, road capacity can be maximized quickly. Smart traffic lights can also be synced to the movement of larger vehicles or conditioned to respond appropriately to situations like gridlock or blockage. All of this programming can be done with expert knowledge of the non-linear relationship between traffic flow and delay.
Parking Zone Extension
The exacerbation of traffic congestion in urban areas is mostly a result of limited parking spaces. Even in larger cities, controlled parking zones are limited to certain main streets. There is usually an unbalanced mix of residents’ parking, pay and display, and limited wait parking zones. The best way to tackle congestion is to extend parking controls away from the city center and formulate smart parking zones, even in less crowded areas. 
To enhance their functioning further, these parking zones can have virtual permits, 1-hour time limits, and regular patrolling by civil law enforcement officers. Making them smart would mean collecting real-time data on commuter parking and directing the crowd to emptier zones accordingly.
Autonomous Vehicle Usage
While using autonomous or self-driven vehicles will not reduce congestion quantitatively, it will help manage traffic in a more advanced fashion. Without human intervention, smart cars can practice effective collision management, discover new roads to reach a destination, platoon perfectly, and gather data about free and empty parking zones to decide the best parking spot. Moreover, smart vehicles will also eliminate traffic jams caused solely due to human error. All of these combined reduce both commute time and congestion well.
Pedestrian Traffic Monitoring
Smart city management authorities should not blatantly assume that the sole cause of traffic congestion is vehicle traffic. Pedestrian traffic, when ignored, is equally worrying. Having realized this, cities like Las Vegas and Los Angeles are using V2I technology to monitor pedestrian traffic and reroute vehicle traffic accordingly. The data thus collected is also useful in traffic light optimization to increase road safety. For instance, Los Angeles is making the data gathered public to real estate developers and locality planners to help them build residential complexes in locations that experience less congestion.
Drone Usage by City Management
This is one of the best ideas to reduce traffic congestion with smart city tech. With the development of IoT based drones, most tasks that once needed inspectors, repair and delivery professionals, or city officials to travel in vehicles can now be done via drone cameras. Smart cities that employ drones to carry out minor repair tasks and most inspection tasks can quickly reduce the number of trucks and buses on the road, especially during peak hours. Even private companies like Amazon are now experimenting with drone-based deliveries in highly congested cities, and there’s no reason governments can’t do the same.
Levying Workplace Parking Charges
Most workplaces offer their employees the option of free parking. This incentive encourages people to commute to the office every day in separate cars since they don’t have to pay anything to park at the office even for long hours. A workplace parking fee is known to have a significant effect on both congestion and pollution. Levying a charge on workplace parking can be useful in promoting carpooling amongst employees, which will, in turn, reduce congestion on roads. It will also improve public transport usage and allow both private and public firms to re-evaluate their parking space usage.
Building V2I Smart Corridors
Using V2I technology to make roads smarter is one of the best ways to reduce congestion in cities. Using connected video cameras and satellite imaging, drivers can be informed about accidents and weather-related alerts as they drive on particular roads and expressways. These roads would act as smart transit corridors, where all the vehicle drivers would have information about the conditions about to welcome them in the next few miles. They can then decide to reroute from a congested road or slow down to avoid further crowding.
These innovative methods require minimal spending and are long-term solutions suitable for even the most heavily congested cities. Governments need to plan well, use IoT, AI, and digitization, and respond timely to a crisis, to make urban roads smooth for commuters at all hours of the day.

We’ve mentioned the rise in bike sales quite a bit over the past six to eight months. Since people were cooped up inside from late spring until now, they looked to ways to get out and about safely. Individuals who purchased bicycles during quarantine may have been considering leisurely purposes, but you now have a huge opportunity to redirect their newfound hobby into commuting.
For any of your employees who contributed to the recent rise in bike sales this year, biking to work will be a change for them. This means you will need to make the process easier. While we’ve written about encouraging bike commutes post-COVID, this blog is focused on how you can help out employees who have already decided to bike
Bike repair station
In our most recent Commute+ Reimagined webinar, our panelist Ricardo Vera, SR HR Specialist at NCR Corporation, touched on why they installed a bike repair station. 
“We were missing something that most bike commuters would take for granted, but it’s pretty critical for somebody that doesn’t know much about [bike commuting],” he said. “We had to install a bike fix-it station.”
This stood out to us as an important point about new bike commuters for a few reasons. The first is just how many things there are to consider when biking to work, especially for novices.. They have to worry about the rules of the road, which route to take, when to leave, and what happens if something goes wrong with their bicycle – just for starters.
While a bike repair station can only ease one of those concerns, it’s a pretty big one. If employees bike to the office, they want to make sure they will be able to bike home. It’s really the same as if they drive or take the bus: No one wants to be stranded at the office.
The second point is the responsibility assumed by Ricardo and NCR, as the employer, to help employees successfully make the switch to commuting by bike. It’s easy for employers to encourage their employees with their words to change their commutes to a more sustainable option. It’s another to back up their talk with actions that can make a difference.
Showers, lockers, and secure bike storage
Now that we’ve discussed bike repair stations, we want to talk about other installations that can contribute to long-term success for new bike commuters. The first? Showers. We’ve all – most of us, at least – been in the situation of sweating when you get to the office on a hot day. It’s uncomfortable, it’s annoying, and it’s not particularly pleasant for anyone.
Having showers available at the office can change that. In fact, employees are five times more likely to bike to work if they have the ability to shower when they arrive. That statistic alone should make you put a plan in place to install showers as soon as possible! The timing is perfect, since there are fewer employees in the office than pre-COVID and you don’t have to worry about construction disrupting daily operations.
When someone does have the opportunity to shower after their ride to the office, they are going to want a secure place to store their belongings. Providing a locker room or personal storage spaces is the perfect complement to an in-office shower or hygiene station.
Ricardo also mentioned on our webinar how, in addition to the bike repair station, his company had more than 90 secure bike parking spaces available. It just goes to show how all bicycle accommodations work together to create a full commuting experience. When trying to create lasting new habits, ensuring a positive end-of-trip experience is crucial to long-term success.
Guaranteed ride home
As we mentioned, no one wants to be stranded at the office. If you bike to the office, you want to bike home, or at least get home. Partnering with a local transportation management association (TMA) can help make that a guarantee, even if a bike breaks down on the way to the office and can’t be repaired.
Transportation management associations are organizations that work with employers in their area to help make commuting better. This can include working to pass infrastructure changes, offering shuttle services, or providing guaranteed rides home. For the sake of this blog, we’re going to focus on the guaranteed ride home.
A Better City TMA, located in the greater Boston area, has a great guaranteed ride home program. (They are far from the only TMA providing this service, just one example!)
To take advantage of their guaranteed ride home program, individuals must work for a member organization or be a tenant of a member community. Qualified members can receive as many as six free rides per year, up to $100 in value. Even better? This benefit can be used for your employee, or someone they care for. You can visit their website here for more information about how their program works. If you’re looking for a similar program in your area, you can simply Google “guaranteed ride home + your city/area.”
You don’t necessarily have to take every single one of these suggestions to create a successful bike program at your company. However, making the effort to show your new bike-oriented commuters that you’re thinking of them can be the difference between a one-time trial and a long-term behavior change.

 Distance to a Station in Regional Transit Networks
By Christopher MacKechnie
The fact that many residences and businesses are situated farther than an easy walking distance to a transit station is known as the last mile problem. Rapid transit solutions such as trains (light rail, heavy rail, and commuter rail) and buses are often used together to increase a region’s public transit coverage, but because they stop only every mile on average, geographically, most locations in an urban area are beyond an easy walking distance to a station. This problem is a barrier to better utilization of a rapid transit network. 
The Problem of Walking the Last Mile
People are often surprised by how long rapid transit riders are willing to walk to a station. The generally accepted rule of thumb has been that people will walk 1/4 mile to a local bus stop. But the truth is, people are usually willing to walk up to a mile to a rapid transit station. 
Note, however, that you can’t just draw a circle with a mile radius around a station and conclude that all locations within that circle are within walking distance. Noncontiguous street networks and cul-de-sacs can mean that even though you might be within one mile of a station as the crow flies, you are more than a mile in walking distance from that station.
Two Challenges
Transit planners face the task of facilitating pedestrian access to transit stations. They typically see two challenges. The first is making sure that the access points are pedestrian-friendly. Nobody wants to walk along a desolate highway with a speed limit of 45 mph. One solution is building segregated bicycle/pedestrian paths. Second, pedestrians need good wayfinding along the access points. Notable in this regard is central Washington, D.C., which features many road signs that advise people of the direction and distance of the nearest Metro station.
One aspect of pedestrian access that is often overlooked is the actual entrance to the station. In an attempt to value-engineer to save money, many recent rapid transit projects in North America, particularly projects with underground stations, have built stations with only one entrance.
 Having only one entrance means that over half the passengers using that station are likely to have to cross at least one and possibly two major streets to enter it. If the traffic light cycle is long, they might wait five minutes just to get from one side of the intersection to the station on the opposite side. Certainly, having at least two entrances to any station is key to pedestrian access.
Solutions for Bike Riders
Using a bicycle is an excellent way to traverse the last mile from the station, but given space constraints, bringing bikes on the trains themselves is not feasible. Providing secure bike parking at the station is imperative, and providing easy bike rental for cyclists to use at their destinations is also important. While bike parking has long been present at many rapid transit stations, bike rental has increased in recent years, with several cities installing bike-rental stations near popular destinations, including rail stations.
Making Local Bus Routes Better
One way in which the last mile problem is overcome is via a local bus. In fact, in Toronto, the success of its subway system is due to the large number of connections the subway makes with local bus routes. To provide a viable solution to the last mile problem, local bus services must meet three conditions:
Local buses serving the station must be frequent. For distances of under five miles, transit is only a viable option if the average waiting time for a bus is very short, preferably 10 minutes or less. Even so, if local buses are to be used to carry rapid transit passengers that last mile, then they should operate at a minimum of every 20 minutes.Connecting fares should be low. Toronto, for example, gives free transfers between the bus and the subway, and most passengers use both. In the East San Francisco Bay region, transferring between local buses operated by AC Transit and trains operated by BART is expensive (although less costly than paying two separate fares). Not surprisingly, not many passengers use both.The connection between the bus and the train must be easy, both spatially and time-wise. A given is to avoid the situation like in Melbourne, in which buses would leave the train station two minutes before the train arrived. Spatially, an attached off-street bus bay is much better than having the buses stop on nearby streets.
Discourage Driving
The least desirable way to bridge the last mile is via automobile, either via “kiss and ride” drop-off locations or park-and-ride lots. Any area dedicated to car infrastructure leaves less room for transit-oriented development and the construction of buildings that act as trip generators. However, in low-density suburban areas, the only realistic option may be to arrive at a station by car, so park-and-ride lots will continue to be necessary.

 Cities around the world are exploring solutions for more sustainable freight. For Stockholm, this means utilizing more efficient water transportation as an alternative to trucks. 
 By Mark Wessel   
Create quieter delivery solutions. Declutter the roads and improve safety. Deliver goods more efficiently. Fastrack the development of alternative fuel technologies.
Those were just some of the solutions explored at the Daring Cities forum last week during two sessions on sustainable freight: the first on reducing carbon emissions in the transport sector and the second on new freight solutions.
The timing of the forum, a free virtual event geared for local decision-makers co-sponsored by ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability and the Federal City of Bonn, Germany, coincided with the official launch of ICLEI’s EcoLogistics Principles that support low-emission freight for sustainable cities. These principles include shifting to alternative delivery options, committing to safer urban delivery and optimizing delivery efficiencies. Similar goals were discussed at WRI’s four-part webinar series in July on a “triple-zero” vision for freight in cities: zero emissions, zero road deaths and zero exclusion from core services and opportunities.
For those watching, the sessions highlighted a variety of perspectives based not only on geography, with speakers hailing from such disparate cities as Bogotá, Stockholm and Taoyuan, but also differing public and private transport views on how best to handle the global freight demand that’s projected to triple by 2050.
Offering private sector insight on behalf of BSR, a non-profit consulting firm that works with 75 major transportation companies around the world, associate Nico de Golia said that rather than worrying about the growth of the transport sector, we need to ask “what can we do to enable that continued growth in freight movement, but also at the same time, reduce the sustainability impact ranging from greenhouse gas to air particulate emissions to noise and safety?”
In contrast to this “bigger and better” mindset, Art Pearce, director of policy planning and projects with the City of Portland’s Bureau of Transportation, spoke of the need to provide more solutions at the local level. Pearce touched on the growing challenge cities face dealing with large e-commerce shipping companies vis-à-vis how best to move goods while reducing emissions. Portland has some of the highest diesel emissions in the country, and the city is examining alternative delivery options and committing to safer vehicles and streets.
In terms of establishing a dialogue around some of these challenges, Pearce said that from his experience “it’s much easier when the [freight carriers] are local and discuss these things as cohabitants of the city.” He said it’s much harder dealing with the larger national and international shippers, where “you often get assigned to the legal department and that’s not the conversation you’re trying to have…you’re trying to figure out how to work together.”
Working with both small and large transport companies is an everyday challenge in Bogotá, observed Sergio Eduardo Martinez, the city’s undersecretary of mobility policy. In trying to address the city’s ongoing air pollution challenges in an urban area through which 60% of the country’s imports flow, Martinez said that one inescapable reality is “not only do we have big companies, but also a lot of owners of small vehicles that bring produce or meat from different parts of the country.” Many of those trucks are older vehicles that don’t meet local air quality regulations.
Previously, Martinez said, the city threatened to fine small operators and impose restrictions on their movement for failing to meet air quality standards. In response, the owners went on strike, leading to a standstill in deliveries. But now, through the creation of a logistics network that involves companies of all sizes, Bogotá is working on a low-carbon urban logistics plan that includes more vehicles, including electric cargo bikes, as part of last-mile solutions. And, Martinez said, they’re working with smaller operators to come up with financial incentives that include establishing special lines of credit to help them transition to cleaner vehicles.
Like Bogotá, Taoyuan City is the logistical hub for Taiwan, through which 80% of the island’s freight traffic flows. Li-Te Lu, director general of Taoyuan’s environment protection department, said that through a series of local stakeholder meetings, the city is creating low-emission zones where big trucks are not allowed. In their place, electric motorcycles and electric three-wheeled delivery vans are being used for local deliveries, with the aim to reduce congestion and noise while improving pedestrian safety – particularly in school areas.
Robin Billsjö, an urban freight strategist with Stockholm’s transport department, said Stockholm has developed a Freight Plan that includes off-peak deliveries from early evening to early morning to help reduce traffic congestion. However, one of the biggest challenges with truck movement during these hours – when downtown residents are more likely to be at home – is noise. To address this, the city is actively promoting “silent solutions” involving the use of electric transport trucks and smaller vehicles. Some of these vehicles not only make deliveries, but also collect local waste and recycling, which is moved underground and then shipped out of the city at night.
Billsjö said they’re also exploring ways to make better use of water transportation as an alternative to trucks, remarking that Stockholm “seems to have forgotten” that it was built there in the first place because of its close proximity to waterways. Now, in conjunction with the construction of a new subway line and the transportation of aggregate from this work, the city is looking to transition from heavy daily truck use in this sensitive historical area to using two ships a week with far lower emissions to handle the same load.
Oceans away, Kerala State in India is also trying to shift the transport of goods away from the trucking industry, through a combination of water and rail to reduce road congestion and vehicle emissions. Shri Jyothilal, principle secretary for transport with the Kerala State government, said Kerala was once the epicenter of India’s colonial spice trade.
The area is now re-emerging as the hub of India’s transport industry, where, once again, water and rail (as opposed to trucks) will serve as the backbone for the transportation network – a “back to the future” transition, Jyothilal said. By making better use of water and rail, the Kerala State government’s immediate goal is to reduce the daily flow of about 2,500 trucks into the area, helping to get 500 of these trucks off the road. And they will work to further reduce the overall number of incoming vehicles through phased-in restrictions.
As part of the session’s closing comments, Monika Zimmermann, a mobility expert and former deputy secretary general of ICLEI Germany, asked what it will take to convince logistics companies – large and small – to transition to zero-emission vehicles, including new last-mile solutions such as e-bikes.
De Golia of BSR said that the public and private sector need to work together to come up with new, more innovative solutions that help lesson the environmental and social impact of freight transportation. 
 A great example, he said, is a UPS cargo e-bike pilot program in Seattle, where UPS is essentially retracing its steps as the bike shipping company it started out as 100 years ago. Working with the city, UPS drops off a shipping container full of packages in the downtown area in the evenings. Cargo e-bikes in turn use this container as a local hub to make deliveries. De Golia said it’s a classic example of “smart policies in collaboration with companies that allow them to de-risk innovation to make it more palatable…which is exactly what we need.”

The Climate Action Collaborative recently facilitated a commuter study to determine how people move around our valley. More than 1,600 residents participated in the study representing every town in our community. While we continue to crunch the data, we wanted to share a handful of interesting initial findings. Soon we’ll be sharing the entire study with our partners and the greater community.
Like many mountain resort communities, the Eagle River Valley has an issue — our average commute is 40 miles per day round trip. That is twice the national average of 20 miles. Many commuting long distances from downvalley to Vail and Avon travel even greater distances. Furthermore, the hilly terrain, unpredictable weather, and lack of a continuous bike path system don’t always encourage easy or efficient alternative commuting options.
“Alternative commuting” is any form of transport besides your personal single-occupancy vehicle. For this study, we focused on our local mass transit systems, biking/walking, e-bikes, carpooling, and working from home. 
Last year pollution from transportation accounted for approximately 36% of our local emissions. More importantly, transportation-related emissions (cars, trucks, buses, etc.) are on the rise and are projected to continue to increase as populations in Eagle County grow. This year more of our local pollution will come from transportation than any other source. If we are going to meet our Climate Action Plan goals to decrease local pollution 80% by 2050, we will need to address our transportation challenges.
Our recent Commuter Study aimed to determine what could be done to encourage everyone in our community to leave their car at home two times per week. It is estimated that this would result in a 17% decrease in local pollution each year. 88% of survey respondents reported being willing to commute twice a week, although, there are many barriers currently preventing it. 
To begin solving our commuting challenges we first need to know where people are commuting from and where they are working. A commute from Avon to Vail, in theory, should be pretty straightforward on the bus. But it is not that simple. Specific neighborhoods present different challenges. Many large communities that house our workforce are not currently set up for convenient bus travel (Wildridge, Eagle Ranch, Cotton Ranch, Cordillera, Singletree and others).
Some communities like Vail have great (and free) in-town bus systems, however, anyone that has tried to commute long distances requiring multiple bus transfers knows how frustrating, and time consuming, that can be. Overwhelmingly respondents reported that the bus schedule did not fit their work schedule and that it takes too long or lacks convenient bus stops near their home or work.
Predominantly, the most popular way to commute is by SOV. 32% of people surveyed prefer to drive their own car vs. taking the bus even though 67% report receiving a public transportation subsidy from their employer. Locals drive their personal vehicle an average of 3.5 days a week in the summer and four days a week in the winter. 
Not all SOVs are created equal. Technically an electric vehicle is more efficient than a vehicle with a traditional combustion engine. 92% of respondents currently do not own electric vehicles, however, 65% of respondents report that it is likely their next vehicle will be an electric or hybrid electric vehicle. In addition to being good for the environment and saving money on gas EV owners highlight them being fun to drive and providing better parking opportunities.
Perhaps the best way to keep people out of their cars is to keep them from going to the office, however, as a resort community, much of our workforce reported an inability to work from home. Large industry segments including lodging, retail and dining do not have the ability to work remotely. 64% report being able to work from home and 91% of employers surveyed reported that since COVID-19 their willingness to allow employees to work from home has increased.
Regardless of your situation, we realize this is a large challenge and behavior to change. It will not be something that will happen overnight.
Instead, think about small steps you can take to help us meet our goal each day. Maybe you have been working at home recently and feel your employer might be willing to make it a more regular thing? Perhaps you could justify the purchase of an e-bike if you were using it to commute to work?
Maybe instead of driving to the grocery store you could walk or take your bike? Together as we take these small steps we can reach our goal to reduce our emissions by 25% by 2025 and 80% by 2050. Via the Climate Action Collaborative, we will continue to work at eliminating barriers that prevent us, as a community, from leaving the car behind.

Dedicated fleets enable organizations to grow relationships and protect against a volatile open market, and advances in transportation technology maximize their performance and efficiency.
By Jennifer Miller
By offering predictability and ensuring consistently high service levels, dedicated fleets enable organizations to grow relationships with their most valuable customers while protecting against volatility in the open freight market.
Yet, many organizations have become resigned to the idea that these benefits come at the expense of a certain degree of inefficiency in terms of empty miles, low driver productivity and reduced flexibility.
That may have been true in the past but is no longer the case. Advances in transportation technology have enabled best practices to minimize the inefficiencies that add to the cost of maintaining a dedicated fleet. If you’re unsatisfied with the performance of your fleet or considering investing in dedicated capacity, here are five ways to make sure you get the most out of your investment.
1.) Use Best-of-Breed Software
Just because your company has a transportation management system (TMS) it doesn’t mean it is the right solution for managing your fleet. The specific functionality required to optimize a dedicated fleet is very different than that required to manage transportation flow through third-party carriers.
At DHL Supply Chain, we’ve evaluated the various TMS platforms on the market and concluded that a best-of-breed approach is essential to optimizing both managed transportation and dedicated fleets. A TMS optimized for freight flow just doesn’t have the necessary functionality in critical areas such as driver utilization and route planning.
In addition to providing sophisticated route planning and driver management capabilities, a fleet management platform also provides better insight into fleet performance and enables more informed decisions about how and when to scale the fleet. By integrating the two systems you get the benefits of a single platform, enabling, for example, the flexibility to use third-party carriers to handle seasonal overflow in dedicated fleet capacity or redeploying capacity between operations.
2.) Take a Dynamic Approach to Route Planning
One of the biggest challenges many organizations face when seeking to optimize their dedicated fleets is getting comfortable with dynamic route planning. It’s always going to be simpler to manage static routes, but, in this case, the added complexity adds value. Static routes contribute to underutilized capacity and drivers.
This can be a difficult change for organizations to navigate without the right digital tools and a partner with experience implementing dynamic routing for dedicated fleets. At DHL, we find the most powerful argument for making this change is to show the savings that can be achieved through software-enabled dynamic route planning compared to the current static routes.
3.) Integrate Operations
As mentioned earlier, integrating dedicated fleet and managed transportation platforms can create value and achieve flexibility across the two operations. There’s also significant value to be realized by ensuring integration between warehouse and transportation services.If you’re just starting to implement a dedicated fleet solution, you’ll need to work closely with the warehouse operations manager to determine the impact of the dedicated routes on warehouse processes.
Even if you’ve been operating a dedicated fleet for years, there are often opportunities to reduce costs by taking a holistic view of transportation and warehousing. For example, when we are engaged as a warehouse and transportation partner, we can often eliminate some routes by consolidating multiple orders onto one truck. The less you look at transportation and warehousing as distinct operations and begin to see them as part of the same flow of materials, the more opportunities you’ll find to eliminate inefficiencies.
4.) Achieve Visibility
End-to-end visibility has become expected across all modes of transportation today but can be more difficult to achieve than many organizations expect. If you’re new to dedicated fleet management, you’ll need to equip your fleet with a telematics solution as the bare minimum. Integrating geo-fencing into your visibility solution can also be valuable in closing gaps that can occur at delivery destinations.
The next step is to bring data across managed transportation, dedicated fleet and warehousing operations into a single platform to make that data more usable for your organization and your customers. At DHL, we do this through our MySupplyChain platform.
5.) Minimize Empty Miles
Minimizing empty miles is another example of how increased sophistication in dedicated fleet management adds value. Filling trucks that would otherwise be traveling empty—whether at the beginning, middle or end of their route—requires both art and science.
The science is dynamically matching capacity to available loads in close proximity to the capacity. We do this through a proprietary algorithm we created specifically for this purpose. The art is matching capacity with compatible loads. There are a number of variables to consider, and we rely on transportation experts, working with our algorithm, to ensure compatibility.
It’s not a simple process, but the value is significant. You probably have a good idea of how many miles your fleet is traveling empty each week. Now, imagine if you could reduce that by 25% – 50% and how that would impact supply chain costs and business profitability.
Dedicated fleets used to be a relatively simple, but inefficient solution for serving high-value customers. Today, there are a number of opportunities to optimize the performance and cost‑efficiency of dedicated capacity, but those opportunities come with increased complexity. This increases the importance of working with a partner that has deep transportation and warehousing expertise and is at the forefront of using technology to optimize supply chain operations.

Tesla recently made headlines with the beta launch of its Full Self-Driving system. That system comes with a disclaimer saying, “It may do the wrong thing at the worst time, so you must always keep your hands on the wheel and pay extra attention to the road.”
Tesla’s system has impressive capabilities, but it’s definitely not hands-free driving. A few years ago, news stories seemed to say that autonomous vehicles were just a few years away.
Well, it’s been a few years and autonomous vehicles are, alas, still in the future. Right now, there is no car on sale that can drive itself without requiring the driver to pay attention to the road and be prepared to take control of the vehicle. In fact, some automakers have slowed down their timelines.
Here are three reasons why you can’t buy a self-driving car today and one place you’re likely to find them first.
We’ve Yet To Define How ‘Safe’ Is Safe
It’s difficult to teach a machine to react correctly when faced with new or unpredictable situations we frequently encounter while driving. Heaps of engineering effort has gone into cracking this problem. But how do we determine when a vehicle is safe enough?
In order to be 95% certain that autonomous vehicles match the safety of human drivers, the cars would need to log 275 million failure-free autonomous miles, according to a report from the Rand Corp. And to prove that autonomous vehicles are even just 10% or 20% safer than humans, the requirement jumps to billions of miles. Since 2009, autonomous tech company Waymo’s vehicles have driven a little more than 20 million miles.
Either manufacturers must spend potentially decades testing small fleets or the public will wind up taking part in the process of testing them. The latter is only really acceptable if infrastructure is in place to ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians.
City And Vehicle Infrastructure Isn’t In Place
Expecting individual autonomous vehicles to operate independently is a recipe for disaster. Each vehicle would have to guess what all the others are doing. Each would rely only on its own limited view of the world, with sensors and cameras that can fail or be obstructed by poor weather or road debris.
Enabling vehicles to communicate with one another reduces the possibility of unpleasant surprises and allows vehicles to make communal decisions to maintain speed and safety. Some cars already have the capability to perform such communication, but there are no rules in place to guarantee cars from different manufacturers will be able to communicate with one another.
Infrastructure specific to autonomous vehicles such as smart traffic lights and camera systems could alert vehicles about pedestrians, cyclists and dangerous road conditions and help prevent accidents. Unfortunately, it has yet to be determined who would pay for the necessary infrastructure upgrades and whether Americans would be willing to accept more surveillance on their roads.
Unclear On Who Is Liable When An Accident Happens
As long as self-driving features require the driver to be ready to take control, the driver will remain liable for any accidents. Car manufacturers are only liable if there’s a fault in their vehicle. But what happens if an autonomous passenger car causes an accident? Is the manufacturer liable because it designed the system that’s at fault?
Some states are trying to address the question. Florida passed a law saying that the person who initiates a trip in an autonomous vehicle is considered the operator, and while the law doesn’t explicitly establish liability, it is laying a foundation for how liability may be addressed. But the process is piecemeal, and so far existing laws haven’t faced serious challenges in court.
Until there are laws in place to protect them, it’s unlikely automakers will accept the risk of allowing drivers to use self-driving features without requiring them to remain ready to take control of the vehicle.
Self-Driving Fleets Will Pave The Way
In the near future, the first autonomous vehicles will likely be taxis and cargo trucks. Both industries have remained bullish on autonomy for several reasons.
First, fleet companies can reduce overall employee counts without totally eliminating the human component. Waymo already has a system in place in which human supervisors can intercede to course correct an autonomous vehicle when it encounters a situation where it’s incapable of deciding what to do next.
Second, taxi and trucking companies are already open to more liability for their drivers’ mistakes. The money they save on payroll should make up for the liability risks if they believe autonomous systems are about as safe as the humans they replace.

 Distance to a Station in Regional Transit Networks
By Christopher MacKechnie
The fact that many residences and businesses are situated farther than an easy walking distance to a transit station is known as the last mile problem. Rapid transit solutions such as trains (light rail, heavy rail, and commuter rail) and buses are often used together to increase a region’s public transit coverage, but because they stop only every mile on average, geographically, most locations in an urban area are beyond an easy walking distance to a station. This problem is a barrier to better utilization of a rapid transit network. 
The Problem of Walking the Last Mile
People are often surprised by how long rapid transit riders are willing to walk to a station. The generally accepted rule of thumb has been that people will walk 1/4 mile to a local bus stop. But the truth is, people are usually willing to walk up to a mile to a rapid transit station. 
Note, however, that you can’t just draw a circle with a mile radius around a station and conclude that all locations within that circle are within walking distance. Noncontiguous street networks and cul-de-sacs can mean that even though you might be within one mile of a station as the crow flies, you are more than a mile in walking distance from that station.
Two Challenges
Transit planners face the task of facilitating pedestrian access to transit stations. They typically see two challenges. The first is making sure that the access points are pedestrian-friendly. Nobody wants to walk along a desolate highway with a speed limit of 45 mph. One solution is building segregated bicycle/pedestrian paths. Second, pedestrians need good wayfinding along the access points. Notable in this regard is central Washington, D.C., which features many road signs that advise people of the direction and distance of the nearest Metro station.
One aspect of pedestrian access that is often overlooked is the actual entrance to the station. In an attempt to value-engineer to save money, many recent rapid transit projects in North America, particularly projects with underground stations, have built stations with only one entrance. Having only one entrance means that over half the passengers using that station are likely to have to cross at least one and possibly two major streets to enter it. If the traffic light cycle is long, they might wait five minutes just to get from one side of the intersection to the station on the opposite side. Certainly, having at least two entrances to any station is key to pedestrian access.
Solutions for Bike Riders
Using a bicycle is an excellent way to traverse the last mile from the station, but given space constraints, bringing bikes on the trains themselves is not feasible. Providing secure bike parking at the station is imperative, and providing easy bike rental for cyclists to use at their destinations is also important. While bike parking has long been present at many rapid transit stations, bike rental has increased in recent years, with several cities installing bike-rental stations near popular destinations, including rail stations.
Making Local Bus Routes Better
One way in which the last mile problem is overcome is via a local bus. In fact, in Toronto, the success of its subway system is due to the large number of connections the subway makes with local bus routes. To provide a viable solution to the last mile problem, local bus services must meet three conditions:
Local buses serving the station must be frequent. For distances of under five miles, transit is only a viable option if the average waiting time for a bus is very short, preferably 10 minutes or less. Even so, if local buses are to be used to carry rapid transit passengers that last mile, then they should operate at a minimum of every 20 minutes.Connecting fares should be low. Toronto, for example, gives free transfers between the bus and the subway, and most passengers use both. In the East San Francisco Bay region, transferring between local buses operated by AC Transit and trains operated by BART is expensive (although less costly than paying two separate fares). Not surprisingly, not many passengers use both.The connection between the bus and the train must be easy, both spatially and time-wise. A given is to avoid the situation like in Melbourne, in which buses would leave the train station two minutes before the train arrived. Spatially, an attached off-street bus bay is much better than having the buses stop on nearby streets.
Discourage Driving
The least desirable way to bridge the last mile is via automobile, either via “kiss and ride” drop-off locations or park-and-ride lots. Any area dedicated to car infrastructure leaves less room for transit-oriented development and the construction of buildings that act as trip generators. However, in low-density suburban areas, the only realistic option may be to arrive at a station by car, so park-and-ride lots will continue to be necessary.

Dearborn may be the home of Ford Motor Company, but the city is embracing a bevy of transportation options as it moves forward with its Multi-Modal Transportation Plan, setting a framework of transportation planning for the next 30 years.
Under the recommendation of Mayor John B. O’Reilly, Jr., Dearborn City Council passed the Multi-Modal Transportation Plan on Tuesday, Oct. 6, clearing the way for a safer, more effective, and more accessible transportation network throughout the city.
Whether one walks, bikes, drives, or rides a bus or train, the plan is intended to benefit all. Indeed, in embracing multi-modality, the plan seeks to make it easier to transfer from one mode of transportation to the next, offering a more complete and inclusive network of transportation.
“This multi-modal transportation plan will guide us as we make decisions now and into the future about the best ways for people to navigate through our city, take advantage of economic opportunities, and connect to the region,’’ says Mayor O’Reilly.
“And we also want to make sure we are offering options beyond just efficient transportation – we want people to enjoy the experience of traveling in and around Dearborn.”
The plan is split into three sections: A strategic implementation plan, a near-term plan, and a long-term vision.
The strategic implementation plan identifies projects that should be completed within the next decade. The plan identifies projects that are relatively easy to implement and are relatively affordable, according to the city, which includes completing gaps in the city sidewalk infrastructure, opportunities for bike lanes, improving and expanding the off-road trail and greenway network, improving the safety of pedestrian-crossings, identifying alternative truck routes, and more detailed corridor studies.
Near-term plans are those that can be implemented without changing curb lines and are within public right-of-ways. These include expanding transit connection points between key destinations in the city, utilizing alleyways as safe options for pedestrians and bicyclists, and improved shared pathways and signed bike routes.
The long-term vision identifies where the city would like to be 20 to 30 years from now. This includes multi-modal boulevards where physical barriers separate cars from bicyclists on the roadways, local transit routes that are complemented with infrastructure that supports pedestrians and bicyclists, improved connections between different parts of town, and green express routes.
The Multi-Modal Transportation Plan is available to view online.

An American auto insurer has partnered directly with a car manufacturer to get access to driver data and provide insurance coverage based on that information — and one Canadian expert thinks it’s a viable idea that could gain traction here.
U.S. auto insurer Metromile recently announced a partnership with Ford Motor Company to provide owners of eligible Ford vehicles with built-in connectivity and personalized car insurance. Access to the car’s data will make the insurance product “more affordable and fairer,” Metromile says.
Many telematics-based insurance policies get driver behaviour details from an app on the driver’s phone or a dongle plugged into the vehicle’s OBD-II port. In contrast, Metromile will get the data from the vehicle manufacturer. In essence, this means the client won’t have to do anything to provide data to the insurer.
“Connecting your car directly to your insurance is a big step toward making insurance much more personalized to your driving habits. We’ll see more convenience, customization, and savings than ever before,” claimed Metromile CEO Dan Preston when announcing the news.
David Kerr, Kitchener, Ont.-based partner in the industry solutions practice at Deloitte Canada, called it an evolution of insurers using telematics data to provide auto coverage for clients.
“Telematics-based solutions have been available for a number of years — I’m going to say 10-plus years, if not longer,” he told Canadian Underwriter. “When we look at the Canadian insurance marketplace and the U.S. marketplace, most of the main line insurers have some sort of telematics offering.”
Metromile is unique in the U.S. market, where clients pay for insurance by each mile they travel. CAA’s MyPace is the closest Canadian equivalent, Kerr noted. These options have limited appeal in the broader marketplace.
“There’s a narrower niche of users who would like to pursue that kind of offering,” he said. Kerr cited his father-in-law, who drives just a few thousand kilometres a year, as someone who would be interested in a pay-by-the-mile type of insurance model. “It’s great for him because it’s very highly oriented around low-usage driving.”
But as clients drive more, the appeal reduces. So finding new ways to make telematics offering more enticing to consumers is the next logical step for companies. “That’s a long way of saying there’s certainly viability in the insurance marketplace around telematics offerings. I think there’s a lot of room to grow,” Kerr said.
It wouldn’t be surprising if insurers keep an eye on the Ford-Metromile partnership as the industry expands in the telematics insurance space. “I applaud Metromile for working with Ford to go down this path and see what the result is,” Kerr said. “I’d be very interested — and we probably won’t know this — about the behind-the-scenes agreements around use of data, and who owns the data associated with vehicle usage, because that’s a very important part of it.”
Having a carmaker partner with the insurance industry to provide the data, as opposed to the client providing it to their insurer through an app or dongle, is also noteworthy, since some vehicle manufacturers have moved into the business of providing insurance themselves in the U.S.
“Volvo has a subscription service that includes insurance,” Kerr observed. “Tesla is offering, in California, built-in insurance connected with their cars. There is a lot of common sense for the carmakers themselves to offer convenience services — whether it be financing, insurance services and so on — that would make it a more attractive, holistic offer for one-stop shopping for their clients.”

Alina Tan, Senior Cybersecurity Engineer at Singapore’s Land Transport Authority, discusses how she tests the resilience of autonomous 
 By Shirley Tay 
“The Singapore government has placed its bets on self-driving technology,” Huang Shao Fei, the Land Transport Authority’s Chief Information Security Officer told GovInsider in 2017. The nation has dedicated more than 1,000km of public roads to the testing of self-driving vehicles, and aims to get autonomous buses onto public roads in three districts by the early 2020s.
But as the city-state accelerates its development of autonomous vehicles, safety and cybersecurity risks must be taken into account. Driverless cars rely on many connected systems and sensors – and a breach of any of those systems would allow hackers to take over key elements like steering or brakes.
Alina Tan, LTA’s Senior Cybersecurity Engineer, built the Connected and Autonomous vehicle lab to test the resilience of  these vehicles. GovInsider spoke to her to find out how her work is shaping Singapore’s regulations on autonomous vehicles.
What sparked your interest in cybersecurity?
My fascination with computers sparked from my interest in playing computer games. I always had a curious mindset of finding out how things work by breaking stuff, and after taking one or two more modules on ethical hacking tools during my Polytechnic and University days, this actually sparked my interest in cybersecurity.
I’m interested in reverse engineering, which is applicable to what I’m doing, which is vehicle security. I have to reverse engineer a lot of vehicular components to see what’s the underlying vehicle architecture by looking at specifications and tearing everything apart.
What has been the most interesting project of your career?
Being able to utilise my engineering knowledge and passion to advance policies and provide regulatory directions has been one of the most interesting projects of my career. In order to do remote vehicle testing, my team and I built the connected and autonomous vehicle lab. We perform vehicle research and testing through these test benches to understand the underlying vehicle architecture before proceeding to test the resilience of the vehicles. The project is unique because we are doing everything in-house with all the nitty gritty details, from procurement to building of the vehicle test benches, and finally performing in-depth R&D projects on test benches.
What has been the biggest challenge of the past year? How did you tackle this?
Everything is a challenge, considering the advancements in technology – especially in dealing with connected and autonomous vehicles. My biggest challenge would be working with different stakeholders that is looking at a new piece of technology from different perspectives (Policies, Technology etc.) and we are starting from ground zero.
Thus, being able to translate all these technical details and explain all these difficulties to the boardroom is one of the biggest hurdles. I tackled the issue by building the connected and autonomous vehicle lab to understand the technical details and translate them into technical roadmaps and policies.
What do you look forward to most in your work?
Since I work on the automotive regulations, and the future deployment of autonomous vehicles, I definitely look forward to securing the future of Singapore’s roads, and contributing to the digitalisation of Singapore’s smart city.
As for the technical aspects of my work, I look forward to discovering new security findings, to help developers like vehicle manufacturers and of course LTA. For me, it’s always about contributing back to the company and to the community because you are actually making everybody’s vehicle safer. By sharing this information back to the developers, I get that sense of satisfaction, because you’re making the roads more secure.
I’m also looking forward to building new vehicle test benches during my work to experiment on different vehicles. Since there are so many vehicles, and I’m definitely interested in understanding the different architectures.
What or who inspires you most?
What inspires me the most is the motivation of knowing that I’m contributing to a bigger cause. Securing the transportation of Singapore always inspires me to do better, so that we can keep Singapore safe and secure.
There’s also this security researcher called Ken Munro whom I look up to. He’s a security researcher famous for testing on planes, ships, and vehicles. One day, I definitely hope to be like him, as it’s fascinating to work on planes and ships.
What are the three areas of cybersecurity you’re most interested in?
As an Electrical Electronics Engineering (EEE) graduate by training, naturally I am interested in both Automotive security and OT security as it helped me understood how the devices communicate and the underlying architecture of these control devices.
In order to secure these devices, I am a strong believer that I will need to “attack” these devices from an adversarial perspective. Hence, to tickle my curious mind, I am interested in offensive security which allows me to find out how programs work by breaking things (in a legal manner) and to help find vulnerabilities within the systems to provide Developers with valuable information to secure their applications.
 What advice would you give to women looking to start a career in cybersecurity?
As cybersecurity is a relatively large field, it can always be daunting to look for a specific career path. There are many different aspects like threat intelligence, offensive security, forensics, vehicle security, and many others. My advice is to always look for mentors that can provide good guidance to path your career in cybersecurity. Having a curious mindset and not being afraid of failures is also very important. Doing vehicle security, you can get stuck for a couple of weeks because there are some things that we needed to test and it didn’t go through.
I would also advise women to join local cybersecurity community groups or associations within Singapore. Division Zero, for example, has a Women in Cyber chapter that focuses on technical, hands-on, and upcoming mentorship programs for women. There’s also the Singapore Computer Society and the Association of Information Security Professionals. I think it’s a good way to approach other women in this industry and improve both your technical and soft skills.

Even a parked car is a source of stress.
Like when you run outside in your pajamas at the sound of the street sweeper coming. Cars left unattended for days might become a target for theft or vandals. They still need routine maintenance, the occasional car wash and a drive every few weeks to circulate the fluids and recharge the battery.
So with the pandemic changing the way we work, commute and shop, there’s probably no better time to see what life feels like without a car.
Here are four reasons to consider a car-free future:
1. You don’t (and won’t) drive much anymore
How many days last week did your car just sit? How many miles have you put on it in the past month?
When the pandemic hit, many companies sent their employees home to work remotely. Total miles driven plunged by 40% nationally in the second half of March, according to insurance data analyst Arity. Driving is on the rise again, but the interlude showed that we can get along just fine without everyone having their own car.
But you’re still making the same car payment as when you drove every day.
2. You have better uses for that money
Americans have long been encouraged to overspend on cars, urged on by ads that promise the right car will make us popular or rugged and unlock the freedom of the great outdoors.
The average American spent $773.50 a month, or $9,282 a year, on their car in 2019, according to AAA. That’s mainly because car payments are so high: Experian says in 2019 the average monthly payment for a new car was $554, and the average for a used vehicle was $391.
If you’re struggling to make ends meet, ditching the car payment would be a huge savings, not to mention the related expenses of gas, insurance, maintenance and repairs. If you’re not hurting, that’s money that can go toward a home down payment, a Roth IRA or paying down debt.
Why not take a look at exactly how much you pay — and how much you could save — with our handy total cost of ownership calculator?
3. You can cash in on high used car prices
If you do decide to part with your car, it’s a seller’s market. The average price of a used car listing rose by $708 from June to July, according to Edmunds, which called the trend “an unprecedented historical shift in the used vehicle market.”
Year over year, the value of used cars is up 16%, according to auctioneer Manheim’s Used Vehicle Value Index.
More good news: Selling your used car is easier than ever. Online used car retailers such as Carvana, Shift and Vroom will give you an upfront price and pick up your car from your home. Or, sell your car to a local dealer who’s probably hungry for trade-ins for the used car lot.
If you sell, consider protecting your assets with a non-owner car insurance policy. It offers liability protection if you borrow or rent a car and the owner’s own limits are exceeded. And if you were to buy another car yourself, you wouldn’t be penalized for a gap in insurance coverage.
4. You have options when the need arises
The pandemic has opened our eyes to the possibilities of delivery: groceries, takeout meals, school supplies and area rugs.
And to the joys of walking, too. What’s within walking or cycling distance? A few minutes with Google Maps might surprise you.
Car trips of less than a mile add up to 10 billion miles a year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Replacing those trips with walking or biking will not only help keep you fit, but also save you money on gas and cut down on pollution.
But sometimes you still need a car. Many transportation services that were initially locked down are up and running, offering contactless service at reduced prices with new safety measures.
Here’s what’s available for longer-than-cycling distances:
Taxis and ridesharing services.Car-sharing companies such as Zipcar.Rides from a friend.Rental cars and peer-to-peer car rental sites such as Turo.Public transportation.

One-size-fits-all tech no longer makes sense
By Corrie White 
Peak season is upon us. Amazon moved its annual Prime Day to Oct. 13 and 14 and is actively hiring 100,000 logistics and fulfillment workers. FedEx ramped up its seasonal hiring of 70,000 workers, 27% more than last year, while UPS is cushioning its workforce with the usual 100,000 seasonal employees. 
But in September, the Logistics Managers’ Index (LMI) revealed new lows for transportation capacity, especially for “downstream firms,” representing the consumer-facing businesses that are struggling to meet the intensifying appetite for home delivery. 
“It is interesting that logistics capacity is already this pressed at the end of Q3,” the report stated. “Traditionally Q4 is when we see peak logistics demand, so the fact that it’s already close to maximum utilization calls into question whether or not missed or late deliveries will become an issue through peak retail times in November and December.”
There’s industry-wide concern regarding how COVID-19’s impact on distribution, transportation, consumer habits and business behaviors will converge with peak retail season and whether the supply chain can withstand the pressure. 
“I don’t think the world truly knows about the avalanche that could be coming down on our heads from a last-mile packaging and shipping perspective during this holiday period,” said Craig Montgomery, senior vice president of global marketing at PowerFleet. “The bulk of holiday shopping is going to be done online – especially if there is colder weather and the flu season. I stand back and ask what can be done from a technology standpoint to make these fleets more efficient to handle the potential surge in demand.” 
To avoid low in-stocks during peak season, retail giant Walmart tightened its on-time and in-full requirements. The casualties of these stricter guidelines will likely be those small to midsize shippers and carriers who cannot repeatedly incur the 3% compliance fine when their less-than-truckload shipments aren’t on-time and in-full 98% of the time. 
In an interview with FreightWaves, Montgomery said technology providers in the industry must not only serve the big fleets, but also enable the small fleets to compete and survive when these mandates come down. While the big fleets form the backbone of the United States economy, it’s the smaller fleets that service customers on a very local, last-mile level, less-than-a-truckload or regional long hauls. 
“I’m talking about the 200-trailer fleet with 50 reefers, 150 drive vans, a couple of flatbeds. This fleet is a real trucking company, and it needs to acquire technology that makes it nimble and more efficient at a cost-effective level after market. And the technology needs to be modular, meaning you can pick and choose how you want to instrument your fleet.”
In the past, technology providers like PowerFleet encouraged fleets to adopt a one-size-fits-all tech model, but that no longer makes sense, according to Montgomery. If a fleet wants to tag its locally moved pharmaceutical or food cargo to keep track of temperature for the customer, PowerFleet is able to provide and scale that service, no matter the fleet’s size. 
“And then it’s up to them if they want to have that kind of higher-level service,” said Montgomery. “The carrier should be able to tell the local poultry company, for example, that its freight is moving forward by giving them the temperature data from door to door. If the carrier could offer that service, it might keep them from losing that poultry company to a larger player.”

  A wind of change in shopping needs is bringing a fresh outlook to urban mobility with last-mile delivery driving huge demand for automotive, both conventional and electric, as customers shift to online from the conventional brick & mortar. 
Demand for the urban last-mile delivery will increase by 78 per cent by 2030, and this will lead to the addition of 36 per cent more delivery vehicles in the world’s top 100 cities, reveals a study by World Economic Forum.
For example, In India, the rise of last-mile delivery has increased significantly in the last couple of years. Rise of the online retail platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, food delivery apps like Swiggy, Zomato have increased the demand of last-mile delivery ecosystem, especially in urban areas, adding more vehicles to the roads.
The study further claims that growth in urban deliveries will increase the congestion on roads by around 21 per cent, adding around 11 minutes of daily commute time for each citizen. This will also increase the carbon emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 without effective intervention, further claims the study. This means the CO2 emission will reach around 25 million tons by the end of the next decade.
Commenting on the findings, Christoph Wolff, Head of Mobility, World Economic Forum, said, “Consumer demand for the convenience of online shopping and fast delivery is rising rapidly and companies are struggling to meet this demand with sustainable delivery options.”
He also added, “Rising congestion and emissions from e-commerce delivery are already stressing city traffic and this pressure will only rise from growing demand unless effective intervention is quickly taken by both cities and companies.

Over the last 20 years, mobile phones have evolved from something as simple as the Nokia 3310 with its basic monochromatic LCD display to the modern touch enabled supercomputers in our pockets. Silky-smooth user interfaces, seamless updates, and an explosion of features and applications on smartphones combine with modern ownership models and app stores to create a obviously beneficial rich environment for the user.
Are electric vehicles (EVs) following suit with their design journey and when will they become an equally essential part of our daily lives?
Keeping you moving when you need and not a mile more.
Cars on average have seen an 8-10 year ownership cycle, imagine if you had a phone or a laptop that didn’t update its software, firmware and other features for that long. Very quickly it would feel archaic.
One of the biggest ways in which EVs are becoming more and more like smartphones is the way in which people own and finance their vehicle. Many people in cities and built up areas don’t necessarily need a vehicle at all times, and even those that do own a vehicle for a commute or daily travel don’t know what their lives will look like in three months-time, let alone the three years most lease hire agreements last for.
Services are already coming along where you can lease a vehicle on either a rolling basis, a per hour or even per mile basis. Much like modern smart phone contracts, plans can be built with minutes, data, and hardware as their own controllable and granular sections of the contract agreement. This allows mobile phone owners to always be on the cutting edge of what is out there. This same school of thinking is being adopted by automakers in making sure no matter how you purchase a vehicle you can get the most up to date device and services.
Giving the people what they want.
With this rise in drive and drop services and an ever-increasing expectation of quality in EV’s across all price points we are witnessing another dynamic shift very similar to that seen in smartphones a few years ago. It used to be if you wanted an amazing fully featured smartphone you had to pay for the best and boldest flagship handsets. More affordable handsets were severely lacking in features, until a rise in high-quality mid-range handsets from manufacturers like Xiaomi, Huawei, and Honor completely transformed this dynamic.
This has been mirrored in the automotive dimension in the last few years. It was always the case, that the highest spec internal combustion powered cars would receive a suite of premium features. These vehicles began to set ever higher benchmarks for quality and features, as ADAS became cheaper and more commonly expected we reached a point where even modestly priced vehicles felt very premium. This has meant that whatever price point the consumer enters the market for an EV they have come to expect stand out premium features, next generation connectivity, and gorgeous infotainment and visual experiences. Even the most basic EVs come with large displays digital dials and a plethora of ADAS features. So how does an automaker keep the quality bar high without pricing themselves and their customers out of the market?
It has been shown that responsiveness in touch and visual systems has a huge impact on user satisfaction, so a simple way to raise the quality bar is to make the Human Machine Interface (HMI) as responsive and intuitive as possible. This burden falls heavily on the graphics processing capabilities of the underlying electronic control units (ECU’s) and the Systems-on-Chip (SoC’s), and just like the mobile phone dimension, it was the platform focused high powered GPU’s that drove this advancement.
And again, across both dimensions power consumption has been a critical consideration. EVs need to find a highly efficient systems. The best way to achieve this is to use a building block designed with the platform in mind to meet all these challenges. Automotive SoCs need this design philosophy from the get-go, with feature like isolated processing containers and multi-core, multi-purpose scalable elements, we can create a functionally safe power efficient environment.
GPU virtualization is key to this isolated environment whilst maintaining every bit of performance. It allows a mix of different safety and non-safety related applications, even completely separate operating systems (OS’s) to run on a single GPU. This is a huge step forward even beyond a smartphone, running OS’s and real-time OS’s (RTOS’s) whilst also providing walled gardens for infotainment and social content.
Always Connected, Always Updated.
Modern cars, and especially EVs are as much software platforms as they are hardware platforms. With every aspect of a vehicles features and operation connected, or soon to be connected these systems linkages exponentially increase the amount of data around the vehicle. Finally, the data escapes the confines of the car out into the ever more connected world. This massive movement of data is sparking somewhat of a revolution in data transfer.
Ethernet is increasingly becoming the winner for all this data to be quickly and most importantly safely, moved around the vehicle. This is thanks to its unparalleled scalability and the proliferation of this technology across all walks of life. With a fundamental understanding of how to deploy it at scale, it becomes an obvious solution to challenges in this space.
Over the Air (OTA) updates have been a staple of the smartphone and are now becoming more common in vehicles. With built in external connectivity like ultra-fast WiFi or 5G cellular, your car, much like your phone, will update overnight whilst it charges, and you are in bed via the high speed data links. 
This unlocks a wealth of possibilities for car manufacturers. As software evolves, and new features become possible, they can be pushed down to the vehicle. This could be as simple as new skins for your cockpit displays or something as transformative as being able to enable enhanced advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) features like automated reverse parking or enhanced highway cruise control.
Unlocking the potential of any EV.
In the future, a vehicle experience will no longer lock you into a static point in time, especially in the fast-moving world of automotive tech. Whether it is moving from one car to the next or seeing your current vehicle unlock features each morning there is one thing that will be required above all to keep this moving, automotive focused, flexible SoC’s.

According to the Department of Energy’s 2020 Transportation Energy Data Book, the transportation sector is responsible for more than 69% of petroleum consumption. The Environmental Protection Agency says emissions from transportation account for about 28% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
Not all that fuel is efficiently used, contributing to CO2 emissions without providing real benefits.  Vehicles stopping for red lights, idling as they wait for the signal lights to change and accelerating to get back up to speed wastes fuel and adds pollutants to the air.  Idling vehicles waste more than 6 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel combined every year, DOE estimates.
While the deployment of adaptive traffic control systems (ATCS) that synchronize the timing of traffic signals to limit stops and starts have improved mobility and traffic efficiency, they weren’t designed to address fuel consumption and emissions.
Now, researchers with the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga, the University of Pittsburgh, Georgia Institute of Technology, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the City of Chattanooga have been awarded $1.89 million in funding from DOE to create a new model for traffic intersections that reduces energy consumption and improves the flow of traffic.
The goal of the project is to develop a dynamic feedback Ecological ATCS that reduces corridor-level fuel consumption by 20% while maintaining a safe and efficient transportation environment. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning will support a number of smart transportation applications including emergency vehicle preemption, transit signal priority and pedestrian safety, according to officials at Pitt.
“Our vehicles and phones have combined to make driving safer while nascent [intelligent transportation systems] has improved traffic congestion in some cities. The next step in their evolution is the merging of these systems through AI,” said Aleksandar Stevanovic, director of the Pittsburgh Intelligent Transportation Systems Lab. “Creation of such a system, especially for dense urban corridors and sprawling exurbs, can greatly improve energy and sustainability impacts,” he said. “This is critical as our transportation portfolio will continue to have a heavy reliance on gasoline-powered vehicles for some time.”
Oak Ridge National Lab is already working on a slice of the problem. Researchers there are using overhead cameras and roadway sensors to identify gas guzzling commercial trucks in traffic. AI and machine learning algorithms identify the least-efficient vehicles, track their path and speed and change the traffic signals ahead of the vehicles.  This eliminates much of the inefficient starting and stopping at intersections and minimizes fuel consumption.
The research will be conducted at University of Tennessee-Chattanooga’s existing smart corridor that features a range of sensors, computing resources and experimental wireless networks to support smart transportation research.
Cameras, LIDAR, radar, software-defined radios, wireless communications and air quality and audio sensors collect information from their spots on poles along a 10-block section of Martin Luther King Boulevard in the city’s downtown. For one smart transportation project, that data allowed researchers to predict where accidents are most likely to occur in the next six hours, based on day, time and weather conditions.
Chattanooga’s 10Gbps fiber optic network is the foundation of the smart city testbed, enabling the sensors to transmit data in real time.  The communitywide, automated fiber-optic network and smart grid power distribution system was built by EBP, a city-owned authority, and includes communication capabilities that not only help manage electric power usage on the smart grid but also supports smart city research. In 2014 EPB partnered with Oak Ridge National Laboratory to use Chattanooga’s smart grid as a living laboratory to test and develop new energy technologies.

It’s not only the growth of e-commerce, but also the ever-tightening delivery timeframes that have logistics pros eyeing emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence, blockchain and the Internet of Things. The challenge is to determine which of these can alleviate concerns like spiraling transportation costs and pulling together final-mile delivery resources.
By Roberto Michel 
The march of e-commerce now has Amazon advertising two-hour food deliveries in select cities. In this environment, more shippers face pressure to deliver goods at a faster pace, all while keeping costs under control.
To cope, many organizations are pinning their hopes on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT). But when will these “emerging” technologies form practical applications that solve logistics pain points?
To find out how these emerging technologies are evolving into logistics relevance, we talked to top consultants and analysts. We found that AI is already being applied to processes such as transportation routing decisions and freight matching, sometimes within supply chain control towers.
At the same time, IoT is being used for reasons such as predictive maintenance over vehicle assets and in conjunction with AI to better pinpoint estimated times of arrival (ETAs). And while the new technologies still need to mature to shake the “emerging” moniker, it’s also apparent that organizations can start leveraging most of these technologies today.
AI’s many uses
Today, it seems that AI is on everyone’s lips. The reason: AI is a technology with broad scope, explains Chris Striffler, a senior manager with Clarkson Consulting. “AI and machine learning [ML] have broad applicability, so we’re seeing a lot of traction around those,” he says. “By contrast, blockchain has strong potential in areas including traceability and contract management, but it doesn’t have the broad applicability that AI has.”
AI can be thought of as next-level analytics that constantly sifts through big data to arrive at optimal decisions. A subset of AI is ML, which is able to recognize data patterns, learn from them, and come up with recommendations on ways to save costs or improve service levels. With some AI projects, AI output can automatically trigger decisions to be executed within solutions like a transportation management system (TMS).
Within the TMS domain, AI can churn through transactional history, current pricing data from carriers, along with current weather and traffic data to make better freight and routing decisions, explains Michael Daher, a principal and transportation practice leader with Deloitte Consulting. Daher adds that many clients are layering AI capabilities into supply chain control towers—systems that centralize logistics data and shipment visibility.
According to Daher, AI’s output can automate better decisions around load planning, mode selection, and carrier selection, says Daher. “By leveraging AI to help automate decisions in these areas, the managers are able to focus more attention on the strategic nature of their supply chain management network.”
Deloitte sees logistics evolving toward three pillars: connected communities, holistic decision-making, and intelligent automation. AI is central to holistic decisions, Daher says, but it also overlaps nicely with supply chain control towers. “I think the first step on the journey is setting up control tower environments,” he says. “The second evolution is applying AI to be able to fully leverage the data essentially being collected by the control tower.”
Within some larger enterprises, there’s a centralized analytics group working on AI projects and other projects that tap emerging technologies. These enterprises tend to be quite forward thinking about AI, but small to mid-sized companies can also work with consultants to rapidly deploy AI within “proof for value” projects, says Striffler. “Frankly, logistics and freight are a great place to start with a use case,” he says. “That said, it’s smart to view AI not just as a tool for point solutions, but as part of a larger strategy.”
AI is being applied to freight management challenges by C.H. Robinson, a third-party logistics (3PL) provider, according to Tim Gagnon, VP of analytics and data science for the company. “We have effective AI solutions embedded in our pricing, tender acceptance, freight matching and visibility services,” says Gagnon, who heads up C.H. Robinson Labs, an innovation incubator for the company.
Gagnon explains that AI capability can learn from the data and processes it analyzes, and be used within a control tower. “What excites us most about these solutions is that they can effectively learn from millions of decisions and outcomes to develop more effective judgements of risk and reward, ultimately learning to better efficiency, visibility and reliability for our customers,” he adds.
IoT plus analytics
The IoT, when combined with analytics, is helping organizations with issues such as asset uptime and real-time knowledge over the location or condition of shipments. It’s the combination of analytics with IoT-connected sensors that brings the benefits, says Ryan Kauzlick, a vice president for consulting firm enVista. “If you’re collecting all of this data, you’ve got to understand what it actually means, which is where analytics comes in,” he says.
Top IoT use cases include predicting equipment failures, protecting the safety and quality of “cold chain’ distribution along with asset and associate tracking, according to Kauzlick. “Where the IoT can really begin to be value-enhancing is when it can predict when and where these failures will occur, so you can change or refocus procedures,” says Kauzlick.
In some IoT applications, multiple data sources may need to be fed into a predictive analytics platform, says Kauzlick. Fortunately, analytics platforms from Microsoft and others are getting easier for organizations to use without having teams of programmers working on a solution for months.
Kauzlick says that his team often leverages Microsoft’s predictive analytics platform. “These platforms are absolutely lowering the barrier of entry for the analytics side of IoT,” he adds. “They allow an organization to create a data set that is trusted, and that you can then easily reach into for analytics.”
Blockchain momentum
When it comes to all of the details involved in moving goods across borders and recording changes to chain of custody over goods, blockchain is seen as an ideal technology. That’s because it’s a digital ledger that lives in the Cloud where partners can access information easily without corrupting it. These characteristics make blockchain ideal for traceability, storing cold chain data, proof of delivery, or contract details involved with global trade, says Striffler.
According to Daher, one of the biggest applications for blockchain is removing friction from Custom clearance. A blockchain could hold common, easily verifiable data on details like bills of lading, certificate of origin, insurance, or invoicing. “Right now, there is a lot of time and administrative resources invested in Custom clearance that blockchain could help reduce,” says Daher.
Blockchain has various pilot projects or consortiums working to prove its supply chain value, including Walmart’s program to trace green leafy produce supplies, and the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). A bit more time and broader participation is needed for blockchain to really take off, says Striffler. “Organizations are starting to dip their toes into the water with blockchain, but it needs that critical mass to be fully effective. We might be a couple of years away from that point.”
Last-mile evolves
The growth of same-day—and in some areas two-hour—delivery windows is making “last-mile” processes a focal point. In terms of software for last-mile, the trend is toward a more holistic approach that looks beyond tactical scheduling, routing, and management of deliveries, according to Bart De Muynck, research VP for analyst firm Gartner.
“Last-mile solutions were in the past more purely focused on the transportation part, but now the evolution is toward a more holistic view that can be termed last-mile delivery orchestration,” says De Muynck. “As part of this evolution, software vendors are offering systems that can help improve the customer experience.”
Vendors with monikers such as “delivery experience management” address this need to gather information on what customers expect from e-commerce deliveries. The idea is to fine-tune the experience, says De Muynck, to keep customers for the long term. “It becomes like a feedback loop where you can manage everything involved with the delivery so that the next time a customer places an order, you’re able to provide a much better experience.”
Traditional routing and scheduling solutions for delivery fleets have been around a long time and continue to be used, but the last-mile landscape now also involves “crowd-sourced” delivery drivers, as well as established parcel delivery companies. More use of drop-off kiosks and pickup locations adds further options to last-mile scenarios.
The added complexity is giving rise to vendors that offer what amount to “last-mile delivery orchestration platforms,” says De Muynck. These solution sets span multiple functions including managing crowdsourced drivers, with the aim of helping companies figure out the best last-mile options. “From a technology perspective, we’re starting to see a new type of application, which is these last-mile orchestration solutions,” he says.
And, e-commerce players—as well as online grocery companies—are experimenting with small autonomous delivery robots, while Amazon and others have experimented with small aerial delivery drones. Currently, says De Muynck, such use of delivery bots and drones remains experimental and would face regulatory hurdles and cost effectiveness concerns, but it’s inevitable that companies will need to continue to test such technologies to drive down costs as delivery windows get tighter.
“Every time delivery expectations get shortened, we see increasing costs, so everyone is looking for those technologies that can either provide a way to either bring down that cost of delivery, or provide the customer with a better experience,” says De Muynck. “Ultimately, if you can provide a better customer experience, some customers are willing to pay for it.”
Autonomous trucks
Autonomous trucks continue to draw interest from investors as well as companies that need to find ways to get goods to consumers quickly and cost effectively. Companies developing autonomous truck technologies include Alphabet/Waymo, Embark, TuSimple and Starsky Robotics.
Rather than fully replacing humans with fleets of “driverless” trucks, says De Muynck, a more likely near-term scenario will be to pair autonomous trucks with human drivers to extend range and lower costs. The human driver could handle urban environments and loading/unloading interactions, while the autonomous vehicle handles the driving for long stretches of highway.
Assuming regulations over driver rest could be ironed out, this pairing of human drivers and autonomous trucks could keep assets rolling to effectively speed up transit times. In some regions, this might eliminate the need for additional warehouses to serve customers for next-day deliveries, notes De Muynck, which would offer a major cost savings.
“This team model, in which one team member is a human driver, and other the autonomous truck, could help move more products more quickly and at a lower cost than is possible with conventional trucks,” adds De Muynck.
The new robotics normal
With the time pressures and extensive picking of small items involved in e-commerce, warehouses are under intense pressures to accurately get orders out the door rapidly. The labor shortage has made this extremely difficult to do under manual or semi-automated methods.
These two key challenges are why autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are widely seen as one of the main technologies that help supply chains with e-commerce. Bringing in AMRs is simply seen as a tactical necessity, explains Remy Glaisner, a research director for analyst firm IDC. “Labor availability is a big challenge,” he says. “Basically, many operations simply can’t find enough people at the local level, which drives operations to look at robotics.”
Glaisner estimates that across all DCs, the current penetration rate for AMRs is somewhere between 1% and 2%, making it early days for AMRs. That said, close to 60% of companies are considering robotics, he adds.
Once an operation does roll out robotics, it’s typical that key metrics are improved by roughly 20%, adds Glaisner. This creates what he calls a “new normal” in which the operations begins to see steady benefits in areas like order accuracy and more predictable cycle times.
“Initially robotics help solve the issue of not being able to find enough staff, but after they’ve been in use for a while, it tends to set up a new normal for the performance of an operation,” Glaisner says. “That is when managers realize that, yes, we can actually grow our business or serve customers better thanks to robotics being deployed in the operations environment. Mobile robotics can be transformative in that they can help move the warehouse environment from being more purely a cost center concern, to being a source of value generation.”
Overlapping benefits
Ultimately, how various emerging technologies can help with the challenge of e-commerce is more than deploying each one as an isolated technology. They tend to overlap in a good way. IoT needs predictive analytics and AI, while AI and ML are also baked into AMRs and autonomous trucks.
You don’t to pick and choose from a list of emerging technologies—you might blend ML with IoT to understand the operational implications of massive data sets, Striffler points out. “There can be strong synergies from implementing these technologies together,” he adds

 With the addition of just a small number of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on the road, traffic flow can become faster, greener, and safer in the near future, a new study suggests. 

The study, published in Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical, focused on the anticipated hybrid traffic flow of the future, which will combine traditional, human-operated vehicles with a small fraction of AVs. This scenario raises several questions as to whether traffic flow would actually improve and, if so, how many AVs would be required to produce significant change.
It may seem that a large number of AVs is required for a significant impact on traffic flow, especially on multilane freeways, as human drivers can simply ignore and bypass AVs. But this isn’t necessarily so. In their research, Dr. Amir Goldental and Prof. Ido Kanter, from the Department of Physics at Bar-Ilan University, present a simple set of guidelines and regulations for achieving the self-organization of AVs into constellations that dynamically control the entire traffic flow.
The researchers suggest guidelines for efficient regulations, such that AVs can cooperate and significantly enhance traffic flow even when fewer than 5% of the vehicles on the road are autonomous, as seen in the accompanying video and image. In their article, the researchers describe how AVs should behave on a freeway in order to self-organize into groups that split the traffic flow into controllable clusters. It was observed that it takes less than two minutes to achieve self-organized high-speed, greener and safer traffic flow when starting from congested traffic.
“Without regulations on AVs, we face a classic example of game theory paradox, such as the prisoner’s dilemma, where each vehicle tries to optimize its driving speed but the overall traffic flow is not optimal. In our research we examine how, with proper regulations, a very small number of AVs can improve the overall traffic flow significantly, through cooperation,” says Dr. Goldental.
Quantitatively, the authors report a substantial increase of up to 40% in traffic flow speed with up to a 28% decrease in fuel consumption. Also, traffic safety is enhanced as traffic becomes more ordered and fewer lane transitions occur. The study shows that these improvements can be achieved without a central agent that governs AVs and without communication between AVs using current infrastructure.

Following the footsteps of other countries, Japan Post testing DeliRo robots that can carry weights up to 30 kilograms and deliver packages within a kilometer radius
Automation in mail delivery was already on the horizon. But the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic has just accelerated the process of deploying robots to deliver packages due to the emphasis on minimizing human contact. Dubbed as the autonomous delivery robots, it can operate in a small distance that Japan Post is testing.
The red-colored small self-driving vehicles are using built-in sensors and cameras to deliver packages. During the test runs that began on September 18, the robots, named as DeliRo can travel to a store from the post office and back within 700 meters. It has a top speed of six kilometers per hour and can carry up to 30 kilograms of weight. The robots are developed by the Japanese company ZMP.

 As per Japan Post, the test run will run through October 2020 and if it is successful, it could be deployed by 2021. At present, Japan doesn’t allow autonomous delivery robots but a successful test run of DeliRo can change that as the government will evaluate its stance, Kyodo News reported.
Delivering Essentials
Since the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic in early January, many countries went into a complete lockdown, forcing people to depend on online services. However, last-mile delivery was still dependent on humans. But they delivery persons obviously didn’t feel safe about that.
In many countries, logistics and e-commerce companies are trying to solve the last-mile problem by implementing robots. This way, it can not only reduce costs but can also increase efficiency. In the U.S., many e-commerce platforms utilized Starship’s delivery robots to ship essential goods like medicine, food and vegetables.
FedEx is also testing its robots Roxo to deliver packages during the pandemic. Such robots are small and can only travel within a few kilometers at max. FedEx Executive Gloria Boyland said the company was testing Roxo for its same-day, point-to-point deliveries in Memphis. Those six-wheeled robots that are based on iBot, a wheelchair that can climb stairs, can carry cargo up to 50 kilograms.
Similar robots are also being tested or used in the U.K., France, Germany, Singapore, China and in many other countries while Amazon has also been testing drones for deliveries that re being tested in a few countries.
Will It Cost Jobs?
While it seems like a blessing during the pandemic, with a recession and subsequent job cuts will force you to rethink delivery robots’ existence. Companies that depend on the last-mile delivery hire thousands of temporary to permanent workers. But robots that are aimed to bring down the cost by eliminating delivery persons will definitely cost them their jobs.
Even before the pandemic hit the job market hard and shifted to minimize human contact, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he would not let robots take away the jobs.
“First of all, FedEx never get a robot to do a New Yorker’s job. We have the finest workers in the world. Second of all, we didn’t grant permission for these to clog up our streets. If we see ANY of these bots we’ll send them packing,” he said in a Tweet.
However, the demands of such robots will definitely force authorities to rethink and when artificial intelligence further develops, robots replacing humans will be inevitable.

National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Researcher Stan Young has a vision of a downtown district characterized by transportation mobility systems that are as easy and efficient to use as the moving walkways found in airport terminals, but on a larger scale. While that may not be our exact future, his work on the Automated Mobility District (AMD) modeling and simulation toolkit makes it easier for researchers and city planners to quantify the advantages and disadvantages of similar transportation evolutions.
The AMD toolkit is a full mathematical model of emerging mobility in selected urban districts—a digital twin that can analyze the mobility and energy impacts of transportation systems in an area. The toolkit reviews the methods of transportation available and how easily that environment can adapt to the changing needs of its inhabitants. Researchers can use the AMD toolkit to analyze how mobility systems within an entire district interconnect and then use those insights to inform decisions regarding the introduction of new modes of transportation to a community.
“The AMD Toolkit moves past the basic analysis of connecting point A to point B,” Young said. “We are looking at accessibility of resources in the district—such as food, healthcare, entertainment, and employment—to its inhabitants and to outside visitors.”
The Impact of Emerging Technologies
Initial use of the AMD toolkit focused on the impact of low-speed automated shuttles in geofenced districts. A recent article from the NREL AMD toolkit development team—Lei Zhu, Jinghui Wang, Venu Garikapati, and Stan Young—in the Journal of the Transportation Research Board, “Decision Support Tool for Planning Neighborhood-Scale Deployment of Low-Speed Shared Automated Shuttles,” outlines results from the AMD toolkit in Greenville, South Carolina. 
The toolkit analyzed the impact of deploying up to six shared automated vehicles (SAVs) at Clemson University’s International Center for Automotive Research in Greenville County. The study determined that the addition of electrified SAVs providing shared mobility services would result in fuel savings from 11% to 38% for satisfying travel demand within the region. However, in this scenario, the addition of SAVs did not improve the vehicle miles traveled, occupant-free miles traveled, or travel time.
“These automated shuttles are really in their infancy,” Young said. “There is a lot of room for growth and, with that, a lot of growing pains. We are excited by how these SAVs can improve, as well as how emerging mobility technologies can change the communities.”
One example of emerging systems is the popular micro-mobility electric scooters. When mobile e-scooters appeared in cities across the United States, work on the AMD toolkit was well underway. The pay-per-use e-scooters, which can be located with a mobile app and ridden to any destination within their service areas, offered a real-life look at how new transportation options can transform the way we travel.
 Currently, e-scooters are only accessible to a narrow urban demographic; however, they epitomize the room for growth in urban environments. Researchers can use the AMD toolkit to analyze other innovative concepts to determine how effective they will be in any given area.
“The e-scooters confirmed the demand for these multi-modal environments,” Young said. “If you provide a similar solution that services a larger demographic, it could radically transform mobility in these urban areas.”
Future Challenges to Integrated Mobility
AMD modeling may also address the one crucial roadblock researchers have yet to fully address—determining optimal mobility options within the first mile from the user’s point of origin and the last mile before the user’s destination. If efficient and cost-effective transportation mobility systems are not immediately available within that “first mile, last mile” zone, then choices to travel by public transit and/or other modes more energy efficient than a personal automobile are not a viable option for public use.
Researchers at NREL who are developing the AMD toolkit within Young’s Mobility Systems Team studied 10 specific deployment sites to better understand the key parameters necessary to successfully implement an automated electric shuttle system. One example of a site studied was a recent project within the city of Arlington, Texas, which looked to address the first-mile/last-mile challenge in conjunction with sporting events.
 An SAV shuttle service named Milo was deployed in a demonstration pilot to carry passengers to and from remote parking lots and the two major stadiums in the area known as the Entertainment District. During the 12-month period when Milo was active, the shuttle serviced a total of 78 stadium events. Researchers reviewed this project and other such projects in depth in the AMD Implementation Catalog: Insights from Ten Early-Stage Deployments.
Overall, the AMD modeling and simulation toolkit offers insights into a range of mobility options not covered by previous transportation analysis models. The toolkit builds on the existing open-source Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) package and the Future Automotive Systems Technology Simulator developed at NREL.

A transportation expert tells Jay Richards, alternative transport may disrupt the transportation industry but only in the short termNEWS AUGUST 28, 2020Share 

Jay Richards talked recently with Tom Alberg, Founder of the Madrona Venture Group and Co-chair of the ACES Northwest Network, about ACES’ efforts to bring Automated, Connected, Electric, and Shared vehicle technologies to the Puget Sound region:
A partial transcript follows:
Jay Richards: Well, you were chairing the panel on autonomous vehicles and you’re part of an initiative here in Seattle. What do you think is the most important takeaway from that?
Tom Alberg: I think that it’s really a combination of technologies. It’s both new technologies and it’s changed business models. So we formed a group here in Seattle called ACES, Autonomous, Connected, Electric, and Shared. “Shared” is really kind of the Uber and Lyft type car services, which really is a new business model. It depends on cell phones and, and technologies, but it is a new business model. Autonomous vehicles may end up being a new business model where no one owns a car, but it’s also very dependent on AI and other new technologies.
Jay Richards: So what do you think is the most positive implication of this coming technology?
Tom Alberg: There’s so many. My panelist Bryan Mistele listed something like seven different benefits, such as reducing traffic accidents and deaths. We have some 38,000 people die each year from automobiles. I mean, probably 80 or 90% of that could be eliminated with autonomous vehicles. It brings down the cost of transportation. So it’s not a rich person’s technology. It benefits everyone, including the handicapped people who need to get to jobs in the middle of the night.
Note: Motor vehicle deaths declined for three straight years in a row, even though miles driven increased, according to Car and Driver (May 6, 2020): “An estimated 36,120 people died in motor-vehicle traffic crashes in the United States last year, a drop of about 1.2 percent, according to new data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).” Historically, most such declines are thought to be due to new safety approaches, not only in vehicle technology but in traffic planning and management, and the availability of safe alternatives.
Jay Richards: When I talk to people about this, they’re worried really about the loss of jobs, long haul, trucking, taxi, the Uber drivers. I mean, what’d he say to that?
Tom Alberg: Well, the history of new technologies, going back to the 1800s if not before, is that when new technologies come along, they often create new jobs. There clearly will be displacement of jobs. But it’s over a long time period. And I mean, I’m such a believer in education that we need to be educating our future generations to be able to have these other jobs.
Jay Richards: Well, I think it’s important that there’s initiative here in Seattle. I lived here for many years and transportation and traffic is a continual nightmare in the city.
Tom Alberg: Yeah. We took a poll recently and the number one issue was homeless. Number two issue is traffic.
Note: The Seattle Times also sponsored a poll in January 2019 reporting that “A full two-thirds of Seattle residents said they would prefer to make it easier to travel without using a car, rather than make it easier to drive.” A cultural shift seems to have occurred in how residents feel about cars.The panel discussion which Alberg moderated was “Will Pilots and Drivers Soon Be Obsolete?” at COSM, A National Technology Summit, October 23–25, 2019, sponsored by the Walter Bradley Center for Natural and Artificial Intelligence, hosted by technology futurist George Gilder. Other panelists were Eben Frankenberg, Co-founder & CEO, Echodyne; and Bryan Mistele, Co-founder, President & CEO of Inrix.

 It Looks Something Like This: During Your Daily Routine, You’ll be Able to Safely Relax or Catch up Work as Your Vehicle Travels the Connected Corridor 
Getting around Metro Detroit the past six months has been fairly easy, one of the few positives from the pandemic. Initially, stay-at-home orders kept all but essential workers and trucks delivering online orders from roadways. With most people continuing to work from home and many schools going virtual, traffic has not returned to its pre-pandemic norms.
Every metro area in the United States experienced a traffic decline of at least 53 percent since the beginning of March, according to the Brookings Institution. Large urban areas along the Northeast corridor, coastal California cities, and college towns like Ann Arbor saw traffic levels drop by at least 75 percent since March 1.
The pandemic gave us a brief glimpse of a world without commuter-clogged roads, and, in some ways, increased our mobility, our ability to get around unencumbered by rush-hour gridlock, traffic congestion and accidents.
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
That coveted mobility, our freedom of movement, as described by automotive experts and transportation planners, is — and has long been — on the minds of carmakers, suppliers, startups and Michigan transportation and economic officials. The future of mobility is being tested with autonomous and connected vehicles in places like Mcity in Ann Arbor, the American Center for Mobility in Ypsilanti, and on the streets of Detroit.
And it’s about to take a giant real-world step. The first-of-its-kind connected and autonomous vehicle corridor — dubbed the Road of the Future — will soon be created along Interstate 94 and Michigan Avenue between Detroit and Ann Arbor. The first phase will test potential technologies and roadway designs for a more than 40-mile driverless corridor between the two cities.
Today, mobility is the efficient movement of people and goods and services with less friction in a world that is more congested, more polluted, with more safety issues, – Glenn Stevens
says Glenn Stevens Jr., executive director of MICHauto and vice president of the Detroit Regional Chamber’s vice president of automotive and mobility initiatives. “We’re using technology and smart infrastructure in a connected world to solve those problems.”
EMBRACING CONNECTED AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
The state is working with Cavnue, a subsidiary of Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners, an affiliate of Google parent Alphabet Inc., to transform the busy thoroughfares. The firm will work with other companies, including Ford, GM, BMW, Toyota, and Alphabet subsidiary Waymo to develop what could become universal standards for autonomous roadways.
The vision is to create lanes to accelerate and enhance the full potential of connected autonomous vehicles and move people more efficiently. Goals include improving safety and transit access for communities along the corridor. The Road of the Future will also link to important research and economic hubs, including the University of Michigan, Detroit Metropolitan Airport, and Ford’s Michigan Central Station in Corktown.
It’s a game-changer, not only for Metro Detroit and Ann Arbor, where most people get around in their own private vehicles but for the world.
“It’s such an amazing time to be in this space,” says Chris Thomas, co-founder, and partner at Assembly Ventures, a mobility-focused venture fund with offices in Detroit and Berlin. Thomas’s goal is to see Detroit become the major hub of mobility.
We have changed expectations of how we live. Amazon has changed people’s expectations of delivery. I think there is a belief that these changes in mobility are far out, but they’re not. If we do this right, we are at the cusp of a golden age. – Chris Thomas
WHAT DOES THE ROAD OF THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE?
Something like this: During your daily routine, heading to or from work or school along the corridor, you’ll be able to use the connected-and-automated vehicle (CAV) lane or lanes, shared with compatible vehicles. You’ll be able to safely kick back and relax or catch up on some work as your vehicle travels the connected corridor. Barriers will separate CAV lanes from others used by traditional transit, freight and personal vehicles. You’ll retake control of the vehicle as you exit and connect with other roads.
“We don’t pretend to have all the answers about what this will look like,” says Trevor Pawl, Michigan’s chief mobility officer.
“As this project relates to people’s lives, the next 10 years are a landmark for mobility. It’s a massive shift that will impact all of us.”
Initially, the CAV-only lanes will be used by shared mobility vehicles (mostly public transit). Autonomous vehicles (public transit and private) will be eventually phased in. As autonomous vehicles become more commonplace, the hope is to assign more lanes as CAV-only, until the entire corridor is a CAV roadway.
The goal also is to design something that is futureproofed. What will begin with connected buses and shared mobility vehicles will hopefully one day allow other types of CAVs, including freight and personal vehicles. More efficient public transportation, such as smaller buses, will use the corridor, as well, providing more reliable and accessible public transit.
RETURNING TO MOBILITY
“We look at mobility as freedom of movement,” says Jeff Jones, co-founder and lead of the AV Mobility Corridor team at Ford Motor Co. “This harkens back to our founder, Henry Ford, and his passion for moving people seamlessly through an environment that was not paved, that was slow and arduous to get around. You got around on land, then by steam locomotive or horse. The automobile and the Model T helped revolutionize movement.”
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
Paved roads and the development of a standardized highway system further helped revolutionize movement. But in a new century, the roadways of Michigan’s urban areas and others across the country have become bogged down, with more vehicle congestion on the road.
“This project will help broaden the use of AVs, creating a controlled, safe and efficient environment to coordinate some of these trips,” Jones says. “We’re helping to improve movement and improve public transit, across Michigan and hopefully across the country. This is the road of the near future.”

Whether it’s ride-sharing, connected public transportation systems, autonomous vehicles or electric scooters, the ways we get around our cities are changing.
Technological and digital advances designed to make the task of getting from point A to point B easier and more efficient will shape the future of mobility. Those electric scooters popping up on the streets of many cities are just the latest demonstration that mobility is indeed changing. They also underscore some of the challenges to be overcome.
The days of commuting in self-owned cars with a single passenger may be numbered. With the rise of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and smart cities, your morning trip to the office might soon start with a combination of smart transport options that consider real-time traffic conditions to deliver you to your destination as quickly as possible.
“Today we have many different mobility options available to us: ride-sharing, car-sharing, subscription auto lease, autonomous vehicles, scooter-sharing, bike-sharing plus public transportation,” says Jillian Slyfield, Digital Economy practice leader at Aon.
“If you go back just a year ago, each of those modalities were unique,” Slyfield says. “Now, in certain markets, you can use a ride-sharing app and see an end-to-end solution for your transportation needs. It might involve a ride-share to public transportation, then public transportation to a point where you get on a scooter for the last mile. The process takes you through your journey in the most efficient manner.”
IN DEPTH
The technology propelling these new forms of mobility is designed to get people around more efficiently. But achieving the best outcomes requires properly integrating the new modes into urban transportation planning and developing regulations that appropriately address the new forms of travel.
The future of MaaS will see us using multiple modes of transportation – such as ride-sharing, car-sharing, subscription cars, autonomous vehicles, platform-enabled delivery services, bike-sharing and electric scooters. A hub-based transportation system can then link various modes together at key points in the city and coordinate targeted services, such as grocery delivery, at key intersections in the journey.
COORDINATING WITH EXISTING TRANSIT OPTIONS
As the mobility landscape evolves, some public-transit agencies are finding ways to use MaaS for serving travelers better and stem declining passenger numbers.
“Thirty-one of the 35 largest transit agencies have seen ridership decline due to new travel options, in addition to factors such as sustained lower gas prices, an increase in teleworking and service cuts,” says Otis Tolbert, managing director and Rail & Transit practice leader at Aon. “The transit community recognizes the trend, so it’s trying some new things to remain an important part of the transportation landscape.”
One option being explored by transit agencies is mobility on demand, which provides riders with vouchers that cover the cost of ride-sharing rides or even of scooter rentals to and from train stations. This approach seeks to address several perceived inconveniences – chiefly, in taking a bus to and from a train stop, or in the hassle of parking at a train station. As a bonus, the option also reduces the need for parking spaces and garages in already congested areas. Plus, partnering with ride-sharing services might also enable transit agencies to better serve customers when construction projects or breakdowns interrupt normal service along certain routes.
For a small number of U.S. cities – such as Houston, Phoenix, or Seattle – a renewed focus on transit-system quality has increased their ridership. Seattle’s bus and light-rail systems have seen gains thanks to voter-supported system expansions and improvements that bring more frequent, reliable service. And a partnership between Washington state and large employers helps workers find alternatives to solo commutes by car.
NEW TRAVEL OPTIONS BRING NEW RISKS, LIABILITY QUESTIONS
As new modes of transportation are added to the mobility mix, they raise questions of risk and liability. Transit agencies partnering with ride-sharing firms are determining how to appropriately assign risk and potential liability.
Ride-sharing is a developed market, so while regulations might vary by state or country – prompting some confusion for travelers – most jurisdictions mandate fairly standard levels of protections for riders, Slyfield says. Still, questions around determining liability remain, she says, likely with a variety of answers. “It’s not going to be a federal answer,” she adds. “Certainly not a global answer.”
Scooters bring a number of questions around risk and liability as cities, states and countries take varying stances toward their regulation and responsibility for liability. As electric scooters have become more commonplace in cities around the world, so have accidents involving them. As of June 2017, accidents involving rentable scooters had caused at least eight deaths in the U.S.
The question of whether scooter rental companies will be held liable for losses such as third-party injuries – such as when a rider hits and injures a pedestrian – will be critical to the industry’s survival, according to Slyfield. “By comparison, rental car companies aren’t held liable if you injure someone while driving a rental car,” she says.
Scooter riders may eventually take out individual insurance policies written to cover liabilities associated with scooter use, Slyfield says, particularly as some homeowner’s insurers exclude scooter risks. Indeed, complying with local law, Singapore-based scooter rental firm Beam recently began providing personal accident insurance to scooter riders in Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, and New Zealand.
THE FUTURE OF MOBILITY: SMARTER, MORE EFFICIENT
Technology has introduced new modes of transportation into the mix, reshaping how we get around our cities. As those modes mature and more new options are introduced, mobility will continue to evolve.
“It’s all about what is the most efficient form of transportation, given what’s happening with traffic patterns at any point in time,” says Slyfield. “That’s where we’ll see interconnectedness with sensors and smart cities as well as consumer feedback – using that data with apps and these new modes of transportation to provide an efficient travel recommendation.”

Scooters are driving the recent micromobility revolution — but don’t count out the humble bike just yet.
By Kea Wilson

The popularity of micromobility absolutely exploded in 2019, a new report reveals — and the surge came almost completely from dockless e-scooter companies rather than bikeshare systems, which grew, but more modestly.
Between 2018 and 2019, the number of total microtransit trips on American streets soared from 84 million to 136 million, according to the National Association of City Transportation Officials, but bikeshare grew a respectable 10 percent, even as the number of bikeshare systems shrank four percent overall. Scooter trips, though, more than doubled over the same period, as a combination of venture capital and growing revenues sent scooters rolling through more cities across America than ever before.
The numbers represent a clear win for safe and sustainable transportation overall, since 45 percent of riders surveyed for the study said their scooter or bike trip had replaced a car trip. But for some cycling advocates, it brought up troubling questions about why one of the most time-tested transportation technologies isn’t seeing the same scale of growth — and what the e-scooter’s recent success means for the long-term role of sharing systems in the active transportation world.
On the one hand, the runaway success of the e-scooter might just be a matter of basic economics. Industry insiders say the typical dockless e-scooter costs roughly half as much to manufacture as the average shared, dockless bicycle — and docked bikeshare cycles, which are the mode of choice in most city-subsidized systems, can cost far more. Given that riders are willing to pay roughly the same amount for both modes, the e-scooter can give a corporation a lot more bang for its buck — and corporations can then afford to put a lot more vehicles on the streets, within easy reach of would-be riders.
“Dockless scooters have caught on for a simple reason — because they’re readily available when they’re deciding how to make a trip,” said Adam Kovacevich, Lime’s head of government relations. “Our hope is, someday, you’ll leave your building, and when you look left and look right, there’s a scooter. Proximity is massively important for driving usage, and that’s an inherent limitation of the docked model that we see in so many bike shares.”
But Lime hasn’t experienced equal financial success with all dockless vehicles. Back when it was still called “Limebike,” the micromobility giant famously abandoned its first-gen dockless bike fleets in many cities before deploying oodles of cheaper e-scooters in U.S. cities instead. Now, the company is experimenting with bikes in a limited number of communities again, but vehicles with footboards still outnumber vehicles with pedals in virtually all of its fleets.
The company insists that cost considerations aren’t the only reason why it made the shift — and that public preference for scooters has been the primary driving force.
“If you compare the usage per vehicle per day, scooters attract more riders — there’s no doubt,” said Kovacevich. “The investment in scooters was really driven by how popular they were amongst the public. Some people seem to look at a bike and think it’s going to require more work than they’re really willing to put in; maybe they’re dressed nicely for the day and don’t want to get sweaty, for instance. I’m not sure that all cities have fully appreciated just how popular scooters are with the public as a way to get around.”
But that popularity probably has something to do with the sheer proliferation of scooters on U.S. streets, too. Practically since they launched, scooter companies have saturated cities with as many vehicles as possible to put them within easy, convenient reach of riders — a strategy that’s prohibitively expensive to do with shared bicycles, much less bikes that sit on spendy-yet-durable docks.
Still, flooding the zone has its limits. NACTO found that after the number of scooters on the streets hit a certain critical mass unique to each city, the average rides per vehicle per day dropped off sharply. Ridership in the bikeshare networks in the study sample, by contrast, tended to grow as the number of available bikes and docking stations did — and among the most successful cities, that growth didn’t appear to be close to reaching a ceiling.
“Scooters really tapped into that lightning rod of latent demand for non-driving — and because they could deploy vehicles very quickly, they did so very quickly,” said Caroline Samponaro, head of micromobility policy for Lyft, which runs some of the nation’s most successful bikeshare companies in addition to a fleet of scooters. “But scooters don’t have the network effect that docked bikeshare has, where as the fleet expands, the ridership expands.”
That impressive network effect, though, may not be universal. NACTO found that a stunning 87 percent of bike share trips in 2019 took place in just six regions: the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Chicago, Honolulu, New York, and Washington, D.C. And in all of them besides Honolulu, the community has contracted with Lyft as its micromobility operator — and Samponaro says that’s a testament to those cities’ willingness to follow Lyft’s recipe for bikeshare success.
“The public-private partnerships in all these cities aren’t identical, but what they all have in common is they’re long term agreements, and we’re the only provider giving the city this service,” Samponaro says. “That gives us the ability to think with a city, long term, about what they want their whole transportation network to look like. Scooters have typically be rolled out on a six month horizon, maybe a 12 month horizon. They’re very much trying to capture that initial interest; that’s their focus, rather than the long term.”
There may be no better testament to the success of Lyft’s approach than its Citi Bike program in New York City, which NACTO found to have the single largest ridership of any bikeshare company in the U.S. last year. And Samponaro says it’s no accident that the program’s success has been mirrored by continual enhancement in the Big Apple’s bike lane network.
“The other key to success that’s important to call out is that the period of time in which we’ve grown Citibike is exactly the same period of time in which we worked with the city to make a lot of infrastructure improvements,” Samponaro said. “It’s a virtuous cycle; potential riders are seeing signals on the street that bikes belong on the street, and then the bikes are right there for them to ride.”
That virtuous cycle has also made cycling in New York more gender-diverse — something that NACTO found scooter companies are struggling with. In surveys of markets across the U.S., the association consistently found that riders were between 66 and 81 percent male.
“When we introduced protected bike lanes, we also saw twice as many women riding,” Samponaro said. So we’ve seen bike share start to look more and more like New York City itself, every day.”
But micromobility companies emphasize that at the end of the day, bike share and scooter share are not fundamentally in competition with one another, because bikes tend to be popular for longer trips, and scooters for shorter ones. And what all riders can probably agree on is how exciting it is to have a solo transportation option that’s safe, affordable, and green — unlike driving a car.

–Asian cities are among the most congested, accident-prone in the world 
–AI-driven intelligent traffic management systems could significantly improve not just traffic conditions, but bring ecological and business benefits as well
Cities across Asia are growing exponentially, and there seems to be no end in sight to the rapid urbanization that is driving city populations up around the world’s largest continent.
Large influxes of people migrating from the countryside to urban centers means that road and traffic systems are constantly being tested beyond their limits, and traffic management is a decidedly uphill challenge.
The situation has gotten so severe that Asia has a reputation for some of the worst traffic in the world. In fact, the continent accounts for six out of the top 10 most congested cities in the latest year ranking by Dutch location tech specialists TomTom. Bengaluru, India, and Manila, the Philippines top the list, and three other major Indian cities also made the top 10.
In the Indian capital of Delhi, drivers in the sprawling metropolis spend as much as 58% more time stuck in traffic compared to drivers in any other city in the world. With the problem only getting worse, city officials have been determined to find a workable solution. That quest led them to a new intelligent traffic management system driven by artificial intelligence (AI).
Intelligent traffic management systems refer to the usage of AI, machine learning, computer vision, sensors, and data analysis tools to collect and analyze traffic data, generate solutions, and apply them to the traffic infrastructure.
In Delhi, over 7,500 CCTV cameras, automated traffic lights, and one thousand LED signs carry sensors and cameras that are compiling real-time data on traffic conditions, which the AI processes into real-time insights. Local authorities can then use this data to make real-time decisions on how to balance traffic flow and can identify traffic patterns and congestion trends, so they can plan long-term for alleviating traffic issues.
Alibaba’s City Brain is perhaps one of the most widely-distributed intelligent traffic management systems in Asia. The AI-powered system is already in deployment in 23 cities in China, as well as in other countries such as Malaysia. 
Gathering data such as video from intersection cameras and GPS data on the location of cars and buses, the platform crunches information in real-time and coordinates more than 1,000 road signals around the city with the aim of preventing or easing gridlock.
In Hangzhou, Alibaba’s base, the thriving metropolis of 7 million people was once ranked fifth among China’s most congested cities but has now dropped to 57th on the list.
Speaking to CNN, the company says that after two years of testing, the system appears to have shortened commutes and also helped first respondents by enabling fire trucks and ambulances to halve the amount of time it takes to respond to emergencies.
“The cities in China are probably facing more challenges than any other city,” said Wang Jian, chairman of Alibaba’s technology steering committee, who said the technology could pave the way for other smart city applications.
Municipalities with smart city aspirations are increasingly turning to AI-driven traffic solutions like this. Saudi Arabia, for instance, has a stated aim to transform into a smart nation as part of its Vision 2030 initiative. One of its major industrial hubs, Yanbu Industrial City, began integrating the AI-powered intelligent traffic management systems from Huawei, which now comprises over 250 high-definition cameras working at 16 major road intersections, supplying high-quality images and videos that feed data for officials to take immediate or planned actions.
The Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) pushes AI to the fore, running smart algorithms to automatically identify traffic violations including running red lights, crossing lanes, reverse driving, and lane marking infractions, among others. The response is much faster, running about 100,000 data records and capable of receiving a response within seconds.
In addition to improving traffic conditions, ITMS also contributes towards smart city goals like environmental sustainability. The Surtrac intelligent traffic signal control system that is deployed at 50 intersections across Pittsburgh in the US, for instance, not only managed to reduce travel times by 26% or wait times at intersections by 41% but also curbed vehicle emissions by 21%.
Traffic management systems help to manage traffic and avoid accidents on the road, but they will also enable the traffic-choked cities in Asia to be more prepared to adopt autonomous vehicles which have a significantly less environmental footprint.
What’s more, the power of AI that propels a lot of the data analysis of these systems, is also what powers the navigation systems of ride-hailing as well as last-mile delivery operators. Deliveries or order fulfillments that had to be delayed in the past, can now be enhanced significantly as cities around Asia continue taking up such intelligent traffic systems.

Gradually and steadily, the number of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on the roads around the world is increasing. The mobility landscape is changing or rather expanding with the advancement of technology. Today, over 47 cities across the world are piloting self-driving cars. Others are focusing on rolling out autonomous public transport.
With the deployment of autonomous cars, buses and trams, smart cities are focusing on introducing sustainable emission-free transportations. In addition, the emphasis is also on solving major issues like traffic congestion. The ultimate vision of having an autonomous mobility system is to improve the quality of life and create healthier and greener cities. As a matter of fact, having such an independent transport system will open doors of accessibility for the disabled and elderly as well. 
This time, we have come up with some of the latest initiatives in the world of autonomous vehicles. Each one has a definite purpose behind the rollouts.  
Doha – Introducing the World’s First Emission-Free & Autonomous Public Transport System
Recently, in 2019, Doha announced the completion of its driverless metro network. The project was a 20-year contract awarded to RKH Qitarat by Qatar Rail. The enterprise is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the entire metro network comprising three lines and 37 stations. This includes the much-awaited Lusail tram network expected to open this year in 2020. 
The new driverless metro network is Qatar’s first urban rail system and a crucial element of the Qatar Vision 2030. The vision is a strategic plan of the Qatar government to improve Doha’s position in terms of shared mobility options. Progressing ahead in line, Qatar aims to introduce an autonomous electric shuttle by 2022. The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) in collaboration with Volkswagen is preparing to deliver the first autonomous public transport in time for the next FIFA Club World Cup.
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, AID-Autonomous Intelligent Driving, Scania, and MOIA have important roles to play in the project. All the mobility players will contribute to creating a holistic ecosystem for autonomous driving. This will include the development of a systematic legal framework and intelligent infrastructure. Advertisement
QIA and Volkwagen will work together to develop the essential physical and digital infrastructure. This will help integrate the new network of autonomous vehicles to the existing public transport network. 
Volkswagen’s Buzz AD will drive up to four passengers in the Westbay area on a semi-fixed route. Whereas Scania’s high-tech buses will transport a larger group of commuters. App software developed by Volkswagen units AID and MOIA will help operate the service. In future, the project is intended to be used as a blueprint to transform urban mobility in Qatar and around the world.  
San Jose – New Self-driving Taxi Service 
German-based giants Mercedes-Benz and Bosch are bringing a new self-driving taxi service to San Jose, California. The companies will use autonomous S-class vehicles to shuttle passengers between West San Jose and the city’s downtown area, as per reports. 
Passengers will have access to an app developed by Daimler Mobility AG to book their journey around the city. Once a ride is confirmed, the passenger will be prompted to a defined pick-up location to begin their journey. As per the companies, their S-class cabs will run on a fixed route between San Carlos and Stevens Creek Boulevard freeways. 
A safety driver will be seated on a front seat to monitor the driving. This is evidently one of the most important aspects of this new pilot program. Once the pilot is successful, the giants expect to use the data to develop a fully automated vehicle. This will perhaps not need a safety driver as such.  
In the past, Mercedes-Benz and its parent company Daimler have worked on self-driving projects. These vary from futuristic concepts to more practical endeavours. But a pilot like this is the first attempt of both the companies to offer something matching a taxi service.
London – Maiden Driverless Journeys 
The UK government has launched driverless car trials for the first time in London. Although the trials are not meant for the general public, volunteers are allowed to take test drives upon selection. The test will take place on two routes in London. In the current trial, the autonomous cars will have a human driver to take control immediately in case something goes wrong.
The focus has been kept on how the vehicles serve with autonomous technology. With these trials, the government will be able to find out how passengers respond to commuting in a driverless car. The UK government-backed trials are being run through a consortium called ‘StreetWise.’ It comprises Direct Line Group, one of the UK’s largest car insurance providers and TRL, an independent organisation involved in transport innovation.  
But the trials are mainly spearheaded by a British start-up FiveAI that is providing the software that controls the AVs. FiveAI has developed the software and tested its capabilities on complex UK roads. Fully autonomous services have the potential to offer a safer, greener, more seamless commutation experience in cities. In fact, it is a far better alternative to conventional cars in terms of affordability, as per the startup. 
FiveAI is working with partners to make self-driving service a reality across the European continent.
New York-New Jersey Autonomous Bus Testing 
The Lincoln Tunnel between New York and New Jersey has a lane solely dedicated to buses and is the busiest highway lane in the US. The route carries approximately 1850 buses during the peak morning hours between 6 am and 10 am every weekday. Hence, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey agency is intending to increase the capacity of the nation’s busiest bus lane by deploying self-driving vehicles. 
According to the Port Authority, the technology could enable 200 self-driving buses to run each morning on this 2.5-mile lane. This will serve an additional 10,000 more commuters a ride to the Midtown terminal. The agency officials believe that autonomous technology could improve the capacity by 30% by allowing the buses to travel closer together. 
Furthermore, the Port Authority of both cities revealed that they will invest over $5 million for the testing. The trials will be performed through a pilot program that will work throughout May 2021. The test will not involve any passengers on the buses. Besides, the bus companies that travel through the Lincoln tunnel must accept the self-driving technology on their vehicles. Two vendors namely the Southwest Research Institute and Robotic Research LLC have been selected by the Port Authority for the test. 
The Safety Concern 
While some people take autonomous vehicles optimistically, others are still concerned about safety. A recent survey ‘Examining Auto’s Future’ from Deloitte shows that about 48% of US consumers feel that driverless cars are unsafe. Citizens of most other countries have a similar perception.
The safety perception extends to the commercial autonomous vehicles as well. Over 68% of consumers revealed they were concerned about commercial driverless cars operating on highways. In India (57%) and the US (51%), people are concerned about autonomous vehicle testing in areas where they live. 
At the same time, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is working on developing a standard for safety considerations in AV decision-making. According to IEEE, regulators and industry are striving to agree on a system for assessing the safety of AVs. Most people admit that it is crucial to have safety standards established for permitting driver’s licences to AVs.
IEEE 2846 is the new standard that aims to establish a formal rules-based mathematical model for AV decision-making. This will enable formally verifying, and adjusting the technology for regional customisation by local governments.  
Meanwhile, to diminish the fear of travelling in AVs, it’s vital that people are made aware of the benefits of driverless vehicles. The solution comes from a recent study called ‘Being Driven’ that found out that emotional attachment to personal vehicles and safety concern are the biggest barriers of people not willing to travel in AVs. But with proper safety regulations, technology assessments and awareness about the AVs, we are optimistic that AVs will have a good impact in the coming years.

Traffic flow during peak hours in a city is not just slow and tedious but also leads to an increase in traffic accidents, mainly due to the rush associated with reaching our workplaces on time. 
Over 70 per cent of the population is expected to live in cities in the future, however, the transportation infrastructure does not proportionately match to that growth. Thus, it is critical to solve traffic congestion and improve transportation quality for managing city traffic in a better manner.
So having completed its road safety artificial intelligence solution test for Taoyuan City in Taiwan, Avalue Technology in collaboration with many partners introduces the AIoT dynamic traffic management solution.
By implementing IoT for monitoring and control signalling at 25 road junctions in Xinyi, Nangang and Songshan Districts in Taipei City, and using artificial intelligence combined with dynamic signal control system supported by Intel Distribution of OpenVINOTM toolkit, area-specific traffic condition at each moment in time was managed through real-time and appropriate control logic based on:
data analysis of traffic flowvehicle type and modeltraffic directionroad occupancy rateyellow light hesitation distancehuman flow
at major intersections and connected junctions. This helped to optimise traffic flow and ensure a safer and smoother driving experience.
Reduced costs of human patrols
Conventional traffic signal controller monitor control traffic through regular patrols or nearby residents would report on any problem with the signal controller. This results in tremendous time and costs expenditure – from the moment a problem occurs to the time the equipment is repaired. 
Avalue’s current technology uses microcurrent sensors and IoT applications to give administrator remote control over outdoor signal controller. Not only does this reduces the costs of human patrols but also effectively reduces repair and maintenance time, improving the traffic service quality.
Verifying real-time traffic information
A microcomputer is generally used in traffic signal control. Due to the inavailability of computing service in a city, quantitative computing of historical data had to be outsourced to research institutions. Not only was the traffic data unverifiable, but there was also a lack of real-time traffic flow data.
By using Intel Distribution of OpenVINOTM and Apollo Lake industrial computer, Avalue processes real-time road traffic data at the “edge”, meeting the need for data accuracy and timeliness, thus cutting down 85 per cent of network cost required to transmit back an immensely large amount of image data.
Real-time analysis for reduced traffic congestion
Statistical analysis of vehicle and human flow based on big data analytics provides a suitable control logic targeted at area-specific traffic condition. A timing plan best suited to real-time traffic conditions helps reduce traffic congestion and travelling time. 
This is achieved by the AI-based traffic management solution, which enables 10 per cent to 15 per cent reduction in traffic congestion during peak hours.
Robust computing in harsh environments
Often traffic systems require installation in harsh environmental conditions. The AI-based traffic management solution’s industrial computers are fully adaptable to complex outdoor application environments, including wide temperature range and high humidity, ensuring uninterrupted traffic service by providing stable operations for a prolonged period of time in a harsh environment.
With the introduction of intelligent traffic solution, including AI smart intersections, public bus driving monitoring, emergency signal management system, traffic flow analysis, traffic controller monitoring and dynamic traffic control system, Avalue expects to continue integrating existing technologies and promote area-specific solutions for enhanced intelligent traffic system.

A food order en route to a customer. When assessing future last-mile delivery models, retailers and restaurateurs must factor in longer-term trends that are likely to unfold in a post-pandemic world.
Once regarded more as a “nice to have” capability, rather than an essential aspect to strategy for capturing market share, last-mile delivery is now a “must have” component of almost all business plans. 
Before the COVID-19 outbreak, most customers were willing to pay a 12% premium for the convenience of last-mile delivery. Today, bringing orders right up the customer’s doorstep is the only way for many retailers and restaurateurs to compete and satisfy demand.  
Drivers Accelerating Last-Mile Delivery
Consumer expectations are shifting. Pre-pandemic “I want it now” expectations of same-day and same-hour delivery are evolving into minimum basic services. Previously, 56% of online shoppers between the ages of 18 and 34 expected same-day delivery, while 61% of consumers were prepared to pay an additional charge for the convenience of same-day service. This trend will only accelerate in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, as customers perceive door-to-door delivery options to be a safer alternative.
We have also seen rapid progress in delivery technologies, such as drones and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled autonomous delivery vehicles, is driving down labor costs, reducing dependency on worker availability and enabling round-the-clock delivery. The market for autonomous delivery vehicles alone is estimated to reach $45 billion by 2027. Furthermore, delivery network carriers (DNCs) are constantly improving their logistics to perform the most deliveries in the fewest number of miles. 
And finally, new talent models are emerging. The sharing economy is also providing answers to some of the inherent inefficiencies of last-mile delivery. As the novel coronavirus has demonstrated, scaling up capabilities fast is easier said than done: hiring drivers, purchasing vehicles and building a delivery fleet represent a significant financial burden. DNCs can reduce the burden, but at a cost.
Retailers and restaurateurs are two sectors whose business models are enhanced by an effective last-mile delivery strategy. The convergence of trends and rise in last-mile options have created an opportunity to differentiate customer experience, streamline operations, capture value from insurance expenditures and gain market share. 
However, participants in both sectors must carefully assess and balance their investments in specific delivery models and technologies, without misallocating precious capital. While these unprecedented times create significant challenges, opportunities exist for those able to deploy a successful last-mile delivery strategy. 
Tailoring Delivery Models
Across this ecosystem, different delivery models will suit different types of companies — generalists, specialists and underdogs. In addition to the company’s business strategy and scale considerations, each model must be evaluated across key workforce and risk-related dimensions.
SHAREWhen assessing future last-mile delivery models, organizations must factor in longer-term trends that are likely to unfold in a post-pandemic world.
A pure-play owned and operated fleet model is a traditional approach that represents a high degree of risk and cost for retailers and restaurants. Many of the Generalists will deploy this model, as they often have a strategic eye to the longer-term reward.
 The ability to fully own the customer experience, while using robust analytics capabilities to leverage key data (such as purchasing patterns, consumer sentiment and demographic data), ultimately enables them to grow their business.
 However, the costs associated with a driver’s compensation, training and benefits are the responsibility of the organization. Moreover, delivery drivers have limited career options if operating in a pure delivery capacity. That being the case, the business must deal with employee churn and recruiting costs. Lastly, the organization is more exposed to the risks of auto accident, workplace injury and food-borne illness liabilities.
A delivery network carrier (DNC) model, on the other hand, enables retailers and restaurateurs to transfer a portion of the risks to one or more DNC providers. Employees of DNC providers often adopt a “gig” mindset, with the desire to engage in a transactional fashion, allowing on-demand, surge capacity at a fraction of the cost of owning a delivery fleet
 As a result, a DNC model is often a more practical choice for the Specialists and the Underdogs. A DNC can also help these participants access commissary kitchens, whereby dishes from multiple brands can be prepared under one roof and deliveries can be fulfilled. This allows asset-light model operators to break into new geographies/markets without the overhead of owning or leasing a brick-and-mortar location and owning a delivery fleet. 
That said, retailers and restaurateurs leveraging a DNC model will likely give up their ability to access and analyze valuable customer behavior data about how their products are ordered and received, potentially putting them at risk of being disintermediated by the DNC. Who ultimately “owns” the customer if a new intermediary that controls that experience is introduced?
Retailers and restaurateurs often deploy a “portfolio approach” to last-mile delivery options, ultimately settling somewhere along the spectrum of these models. Companies with the scale and ability to harness insights from data are likely to in-source and invest substantively in their own last-mile solutions, while smaller organizations will be more likely to partner with DNCs to handle delivery.
 Mergers-and-acquisitions (M&A) activity is also an option for large corporations to obtain last-mile delivery capacity. A prime example of this is the retail giant Target’s purchase of Shipt, and Uber recently announced a $2.65 million acquisition of Postmates, a local delivery service. 
There are also instances where large delivery operations may purchase a retailer, as happened when Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market. These opportunities are increasingly likely to emerge as the current pandemic progresses.
Internal and External Considerations
When assessing future last-mile delivery models, organizations must factor in longer-term trends that are likely to unfold in a post-pandemic world — evolving workforce and regulatory considerations heightening potential cost pressures, a migration to autonomous mobility modes and the impacts of climate change. 
The blending of these models also requires retailers and restaurateurs to evaluate internal considerations, including how demand patterns could change over time, especially after the pandemic; how to create differentiated experiences for customers through last-mile delivery services; how to achieve more efficient production; and how to determine the value of anonymized order-preference data along with the cost of using this data.
Liability and/or workers’ compensation issues unique to the current and future operating environment also need consideration. Organizations may explore the kinds of loss controls that should be in place and what health considerations will be required to protect their workforce and customers following COVID-19.
Delivery model choices may seem obvious. However, given the evolving business landscape — market uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, rapidly maturing technologies and increasing customer expectations — a seemingly appropriate solution today may not be the right choice tomorrow.

The coronavirus will have a lasting effect on smart cities, including a bigger focus on modernization and digitization and greater use of autonomous vehicles, according to experts from Dentons’ Smart Cities and Communities Initiative and Think Tank, a service of the global law firm.  
To learn more about the specific marks the pandemic is leaving on local communities, GCN spoke with Clint Vince, head of the think tank, and Eric Tanenblatt, the firm’s global chairman of public policy and regulation and leader of the firm’s autonomous vehicles group. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.
How has the pandemic changed the approach to smart cities and communities in general?
Vince: There’s going to be a new normal, and there are positive and negatives to that. I think probably the most dramatic things we’ve seen are an increasing number of crises. We have the 3 Cs of 2020, which are COVID, climate and cyber, and then layered on top of that you have economic disruption and then social unrest. Within that context, I think that cities and communities are going to be challenged by economics in a very serious way, and we’re going to need to find silver linings. Probably the magic word for the next five to 10 years is going to be “resilience.” That covers a range of subjects: human health, environmental health, economic health, social health.
Of particular interest is the need for more broadband. What are some silver linings related to that?
Tanenblatt: With people sheltering at home, the pandemic has really put an emphasis on the need for the expansion of broadband. You’re seeing it in not just rural areas, but also in urban areas. I think the growth and expansion of broadband is going to allow for technologies to expand. One area that I focus a lot of attention on is autonomous vehicles, but not just passenger vehicles. As we’ve seen during COVID, autonomous technology was deployed to assist with issues related to the pandemic. For example, Nuro, which is an autonomous grocery service, was delivering groceries in Northern California. The Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville is using autonomous vehicles to transport pharmaceuticals to elderly patients. I see autonomous technology and autonomous vehicles as something that really crosses the income spectrum.
With so many public- and private-sector workers and schoolchildren connecting online, the gap between the haves and have-nots became glaringly obvious. Are there steps that cities can start to take to close the digital divide?
Vince: We’re seeing cities now trying to create full-city broadband service for everybody, and I think that’s going to become a pretty significant national trend. The biggest impediment so far to broadband has not been so much technology as funding. I just believe this is going to have to be prioritized. Although there has been some funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, I think this will continue to be a really important priority.
How can cities, counties and states best prioritize what to put funding toward?
Vince: The cities are looking at middle mile and then last mile with respect to broadband, and I think they’re going to try to fill in there. I also think the new whole new development of remote work is not yet fully understood — that’s another tremendous opportunity as cities and communities look at social infrastructure. Remote work could impact everything from transportation, and it can impact issues like climate. If it’s carefully orchestrated, it could even reduce traffic congestion.
What should cities do now to continue to respond to the ongoing crisis but also prepare for future ones?
Vince: One thing that’s been clear with all the different crises that are developing is that there has to be an entirely new sense of urgency at the city and community level. Certainly, cities and communities right now are on the front lines, and their physical infrastructure is aging. Their digital infrastructure is fascinating and developing much quicker than their social infrastructure and so the understanding of the Think Tank is that smart cities are much more than a technology play. Although technology presents a tremendous opportunity, we really have to look at smart cities as an infrastructure modernization project that includes digital infrastructure, which would include the internet of things and other digital technology, but also in an integrated way, we have to address physical infrastructure and probably now social infrastructure.

There was a brief period a couple of years ago in Silicon Valley, when e-scooter startups became the hottest ticket. Their founders claimed to have solved the last-mile issues faced by people living and working in cities across the world. 
Soon, scooters spread from the US to cities in Europe and eventually to Dubai where several startups positioned their scooters in densely populated areas, offering a cheap and fun alternative to taxis. Interest was high in these micro mobility startups, that is until the Road and Transport Authority (RTA) banned them, citing safety concerns. And so the scooters that had sprung up in Dubai vanished, a couple of companies relocated to Abu Dhabi whose regulator had a more favourable view of them, but as lockdown kept people stuck indoors, the fate of micro mobility startups seemed numbered. 
Germany’s Circ responded by shutting down its Middle East operations in Abu Dhabi, Bahrain and Qatar while Careem halted its bicycle-sharing business in the UAE in the early stages of the lockdown. 
“The mobility sector in general was hit by more than 70 per cent during the early stages of the pandemic as people were growing wary of using public transit or ride-hailing services of all kinds,” says Mohamed Nagaty, chief commercial officer (CCO) and co-founder of Egypt-based logistics, tuk-tuk and motorcycle ride-hailing startup Halan. “The average number of trips per user was cut in half towards the end of Q1 2020.”
While the number of trips has now picked up across the region as lockdown measures are lifted, the B2C side of micro mobility is still struggling. 
DIFFICULT UNIT ECONOMICS
Investor appetite has diminished as work from home and flexible working conditions have driven down the need for everyday transportation across the world. According to Dheeraj Bhardwaj, group CEO of Arnab, UAE-based e-scooter startup, this lack of investor appetite in micro mobility stands as a key deterrent to the sector. 
Prior to the lockdown, Arnab had expanded to Sharjah, was confident of a return to scooters in Dubai and was in the process of raising venture capital (VC) funding – a deal which has faltered due to the negative impact that Covid-19 has had on the company’s B2C operations. 
But the woes of e-scooters are not limited to the aftermath of the pandemic. 
“When it comes to the business itself, there is another major challenge concerning the scooters as you need to constantly ensure that they are in good shape. You will lose all your assets if you abandon them in the warehouse,” says Bhardwaj.
The constant need to make sure their batteries are fully-charged requires manpower, an uncharged or idle scooter makes no money, there is also the risk of damage and theft which makes for “difficult” and somewhat risky unit economics. 
The almost year-round hot weather conditions coupled with the inhospitable infrastructure for micro mobility in many cities in the region make it hard for a startup to ensure long-term sustainability according Saif Eddin Jabarim, global network assistant professor at New York University who believes that micro mobility cannot qualify as a daily commute solution. 
“The infrastructure is not well suited for this kind of transport mode given that the UAE is a high-road oriented country,” says Jabrim “[But] using bicycles for recreation is a trend that is likely to pick up.”
Scooters are not suited to long-distance travel, or even between neighbouring areas in some cities due to a lack of infrastructure and so some companies are limiting them to specific, sometimes enclosed areas. Saudi Arabia-based e-scooters provider Dabeeb limited its operations to crowded marketplaces like parks and university campuses. 
“In a country like Saudi Arabia – where the weather is mostly hot throughout the year – cars are the most common mode of transport as people have to [go] large distances between destinations,” says Mohamed Khalaf, co-founder and general manager at Dabeeb. “However, we saw a demand for our services in small communities and residential areas where people can use our scooters for short-distance travel.”
A NEW OPPORTUNITY
In terms of passenger movement, McKinsey & Co predicts that micro mobility service providers will suffer short-term losses, but the sector is set for recovery as lockdown measures are lifted. In a 2019 report, the consultancy predicted the micro mobility sector will be worth $500 billion by 2030, whether this is still likely remains to be seen, but right now, much of the growth is coming from the B2B segment.  
For the majority of micro mobility startups in the Middle East and North Africa (Mena), Covid-19 presented an opportunity to pivot, to leverage their existing fleet of scooters and tuk tuks to use them in last-mile delivery services.
Instead of moving people, Halan responded by doubling down on delivery and e-payment solutions in Egypt to stay relevant in the changing business climate. Amid the crisis, Halan launched peer-to-peer delivery services and piloted courier services. “We also had to dispatch more drivers to restaurant chains. In Sudan, we offer a grocery delivery service to cater to our customers,” says Nagaty.
For Arnab, the pandemic has led to the emergence of its B2B model.
“Surprisingly, we were approached by the Dubai Police and the Dubai Municipality as they asked us to provide scooters to them so they could use them in patrolling operations to ensure that the people were following the lockdown rules,” says Bhardwaj. “Some local supermarkets also started to use our scooters on a subscription basis for delivery purposes.”
Meanwhile, Dubai-based electric motorcycle and e-bike startup One Moto saw an increase in interest for its vehicles from on-demand delivery companies and other service providers in the UAE. 
“One of the delivery companies we are working with has gone from 12,000 to 40,000 deliveries over a week. So, they had to increase their fleet by nearly four times to meet the unprecedented demand,” says Adam Ridgway, CEO and co-founder of One Moto, who expects the B2B market to continue to grow in the short term. 
“Around 80 per cent of delivery operators throughout the region use electric vehicles for their commercial deliveries,” he says. “The motorcycle deliveries market in the UAE is estimated to be valued at $150 million. While the market in the GCC or the Mena region including Egypt and Saudi Arabia is 18 times larger than the UAE market.”
NEAR FUTURE
Dubai’s RTA ban on scooters did not extend to personal scooters and so the sight of individuals whizzing past on an e-scooter is still somewhat common in certain parts of the city. In a roundtable session with Wamda, representatives from the RTA explained that the ban is under review and new regulations will be issued once safety studies are completed. 
In the meantime, Bhardwaj expects more people will invest in personal micro mobility devices as a way to travel between short distances, especially now that public transport is deemed a health risk. For those who cannot afford to own their own device, e-scooters, tuk tuks and bikes will seem more appealing than buses and micro-buses. 
But for Jabarim, it is the B2B space that will drive the growth of micro mobility.
“I do not think there is a lot worth investing in the ‘moving humans’ space right now. But I think there is a lot of potential when it comes to moving products,” he says. 
It is a sentiment that Halan’s Nagaty agrees with.  “On a global level, micro mobility on its own is not an attractive sector for investment today, unless bundled with other services. Investors must focus on companies with profitable business lines, and a clear path to profitability – which would be tough to achieve if the company runs solely on mobility,” he says.

Every morning, each one of us has our smartphones in our hands, checking Google Maps so as to find out the amount of traffic on the road from our home to our respective offices. If we find there is traffic congestion on the road,  we tend to delay and wait for the road to clear. Even when we want to visit a mall or another city it is prudent to check Google Maps for the correct route and amount of traffic before starting the trip.
 Presently Google Maps is the most widely-used application when considering the right route and amount of traffic congestion. It does not apparently solve the problem of traffic jams. We need a more complex and intelligent system to take care of it.
Each of us owns a smart device. It may be your smartphone, a smartwatch, an iPad, or even AI-powered personal assistants. All these devices have an on/off button and require internet connectivity. 
These IoT are devices are interconnected, and data from these devices can be clubbed to draw conclusions. IoT is capable of sending and receiving data from each other without human help. There are numerous ways IoT is helping us to make our daily life more comfortable. One of the practical areas is Traffic Management System. IoT can be effectively used to reduce traffic congestion on roads. 

Traffic Management
Firstly we have to identify the areas with heavy traffic. For example, take the route from Electronic City and HSR Layout. A large number of residents from HSR Layout go to electronic city every day for work. The data for the number of offices in Electronic city and the number of employees working in each and every company can be fed into a computer. 
The number of employees, their working hours, their working shifts, the mode of transportation taken by them from office to home and from home to office, their entry time to office and exit time from office to home can be fed to the computers. This data can be processed using AI and data sciences into useful information like how many and what type of vehicles will be road per minute.
 If we know exactly how many vehicles i.e. two-wheelers, four-wheeler or private or public vehicles are to leave at a particular time, the number of vehicles on the road can be accurately predicted. An alert can be sent on time to various other employees who are in the office so that they can start when the congestion on the road is less. By working on the management of vehicles on the road definitely, we can ensure smooth movement of vehicles on the road. 
The benefits would be reduced travel time for the employees. The employees also have to take initiative by feeding their data into the computers of what kind of vehicles they own and what time they leave the office. All this data can be collected from various devices via the Internet and compiled to form a flowchart for traffic management. 
Sensors & Cameras
Various sensors and video cameras can be installed on multiple points on the road which can actually count the number of vehicles on the road and sending alert to the various employees who will be starting in 15 minutes. 
The sensors can increase the time for green light if there are more vehicles on the road than expected. This would ensure the rapid movement of all the vehicles without any stoppage. Similarly, if there are lesser number of vehicles the time for red light can be increased so that more vehicles can come out of the offices. Sensors can re-route and provide alternate shorter routes in case of a sudden increase of traffic volume. Similarly, empty parking areas can be notified to a vehicle looking to park near the required destination. Roads needing repairs can be spotted and action can be taken for timely repairs.
Artificial intelligence-based analytics software like automatic number plate recognition and red light violation detection using face recognition systems will monitor various traffic junctions and other sensitive areas to identify traffic offenders and issue alarms habitual offenders can be issued e-challans.
Outlook
Traffic management using IoT and Facial- recognition will surely ensure better days. Though it requires co-operation of each and every individual. On the hindsight lot of private data will have to be shared. People may not be ready to use facial recognition as it is something private and personal. Therefore by using the data gathered efficiently and carefully we can make our lives easier. At the same time, the rights and privacy of all citizens should be protected.

The trucking industry has seen dramatic change in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every fleet — some have seen an uptick in business, while other businesses have suffered. But by and large, most fleets seem to feel the worst is behind us, and are now looking towards the future.
To that end, based on our work with thousands of fleets around the world, we are seeing three telematics trends emerge: fleets are investing in video telematics, predictive analytics and enhanced driver safety measurement.
 While the telematics field is well established, video telematics is somewhat new. Typically, telematics involves collecting data surrounding each trip, vehicle and driver, and using it to improve safety, efficiency and compliance. Now, it’s possible to add video to the mix. 
Video is collected via in-cab and out-of-cab cameras affixed to a vehicle. The cameras can capture what’s happening both inside and outside the vehicle, including driver behavior but also what nearby drivers and vehicles are doing. 
Video telematics solutions can be event triggered – for instance, only capturing clips when a driver exceeds a speed threshold or is involved in a crash – or continuously monitored live.
In-cab video monitoring has proven time and time again to help improve poor driver behavior and overall fleet safety. Integrated in-cab video solutions allow videos to be automatically appended to driver profiles and tied to specific reports depicting specific triggered events, providing the opportunity for:
Video-led driver coaching and trainingPost-crash analysisCrash prevention and reductionSubrogation of insurance claims
Video also adds an important element to post-crash analysis, providing unprecedented insight (and irrefutable evidence) into what occurred in a cab and around the vehicle at the time of an incident.
Predictive analytics (or predictive modeling) is a process that uses data and statistics to predict outcomes with data models. The models can be used to predict all sorts of things, from customer demand to which drivers are most likely to be involved in a crash. By predicting events, fleets can take proactive steps to avoid negative ones – such as a crash. Steps might include remedial training for drivers or alerting a manager.
Predictive analytics models are built using both historical data and environmental inputs (such as weather and traffic data) to identify patterns that could indicate the likelihood of something occurring. Fleet management solutions are starting to incorporate predictive analytics into their platforms to help fleets do a better job anticipating and managing change.
For example, predictive analytics models can be used to tell the fleet manager which drivers are highest risk, in what areas and what actions need to be taken to mitigate the risk.
Enhanced driver safety measurement: According to the FMCSA, in 2017 (latest figures available), 4,889 large trucks and buses were involved in fatal crashes, a 9 percent increase from 2016. The critical pre-crash event for 73 percent of the large trucks in fatal crashes was another vehicle, person, animal, or object in the large truck’s lane or encroaching into it.
Most telematics systems now provide fleet managers with safety reports or driver scorecards that rate and rank drivers based on their safety profile. These reports help managers identify drivers who may need additional training. They can also act as powerful incentives to drivers to improve on their own. Initially, fleet managers can make comparisons to baseline data. Over time, most fleets look at week-over-week, quarter-over-quarter, or year-over-year data. Large companies may break their analysis down into regions or teams.
Driver scorecards have emerged as a critical element of managing and improving driver safety. Newer options for scorecards include adding seatbelt events and hours of service events into the scoring model.
Most fleets have the data they need for all of this, thanks to ELDs.
Thanks to the ELD Mandate, most US heavy-duty fleets already have the ability to collect the data they need to monitor and modify driver behavior. At a minimum, fleets should collect data on:
Speeding incidentsHarsh acceleration and braking incidentsCorner handling incidentsCrashes
These data points go a long way towards satisfying a fleet’s need to improve safety, efficiency and compliance. Add video data to the mix, and a fleet has everything required to add these three techniques – video telematics, predictive modeling and enhanced driver safety scorecards – to their arsenal.

Neolix, a maker of urban robo-delivery trucks, made an interesting claim recently. The Beijing-based company said orders for its self-driving delivery vehicles were soaring because the coronavirus epidemic had both cleared the roads of cars and opened the eyes of customers to the advantages of driverlessness. The idea is that when the epidemic is over, the new habits may well persist.
Neolix last week told Automotive News it had booked 200 orders in the past two months after having sold just 159 in the eight months before. And on 11 March, the company confirmed that it had raised US $29 million in February to fund mass production.CLICK HERE FOR ADDITIONAL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE
Of course, this flurry of activity could merely be coincidental to the epidemic, but Tallis Liu, the company’s manager of business development, maintains that it reflects changing attitudes in a time of plague.
“We’ve seen a rise in both acceptance and demand both from the general public and from the governmental institutions,” he tells IEEE Spectrum. The sight of delivery bots on the streets of Beijing is “educating the market” about “mobility as a service” and on “how it will impact people’s day-to-day lives during and after the outbreak.”
During the epidemic, Neolix has deployed 50 vehicles in 10 major cities in China to do mobile delivery and also disinfection service. Liu says that many of the routes were chosen because they include public roads that the lockdown on movement has left relatively empty. 
The company’s factory has a production capacity of 10,000 units a year, and most of the  factory staff has returned to their positions,  Liu adds. “Having said that, we are indeed facing some delays from our suppliers given the ongoing situation.”
Neolix’s deliverybots are adorable—a term this site once used to describe a strangely similar-looking rival bot from the U.S. firm Nuro. The bots are the size of a small car, and they’re each equipped with cameras, three 16-channel lidar laser sensors, and one single-channel lidar. The low-speed version also has 14 ultrasonic short-range sensors; on the high-speed version, the ultrasonic sensors are supplanted by radars.
If self-driving technology benefits from the continued restrictions on movement in China and around the world, it wouldn’t be the first time that necessity had been the mother of invention. An intriguing example is furnished by a mere two-day worker’s strike on the London Underground in 2014. Many commuters, forced to find alternatives, ended up sticking with those workarounds even after Underground service resumed, according to a 2015 analysis by three British economists.
One of the researchers, Tim Willems of Oxford University, tells Spectrum that disruptions can induce permanent changes when three conditions are met. First, “decision makers are lulled into habits and have not been able to achieve their optimum (close to our Tube strike example).” Second, “there are coordination failures that make it irrational for any one decision maker to deviate from the status quo individually” and a disruption “forces everybody away from the status quo at the same time.” And third, the reluctance to pay the fixed costs required to set up a new way of doing things can be overcome under crisis conditions.
By that logic, many workers sent home for months on end to telecommute will stay on their porches or in their pajamas long after the all-clear signal has sounded. And they will vastly accelerate the move to online shopping, with package delivery of both the human and the nonhuman kind.
On Monday, New York City’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, said he was suspending his long-running campaign against e-bikes. “We are suspending that enforcement for the duration of this crisis,” he said. And perhaps forever.

Currently, there is a lot of stress on both developing and developed countries to adhere to certain standards when it comes to urban planning. Cities today are all pitched to be smart cities in that they not only have the modern technologies and conveniences but are also aiming to be clean, pollution-free and energy-efficient. The one aspect of urban planning that affects almost every one of the above criteria is the concept of last-mile delivery logistics.
Last-mile delivery and its importance
What exactly is last-mile delivery logistics? To understand that particular concept, we have to look at the most popular business model that is prevalent currently, which is e-commerce. People today are using the internet and mobile technology to purchase everything from basic necessities like groceries and clothing to specialized services. This has forced companies and corporations to adopt a new business model which involves businesses delivering goods to the customer’s doorstep, the planning and execution of which is known as last-mile delivery logistics. The whole concept, the planning and implementation are so complicated and yet important that not enough attention can totally disrupt urban life.
The importance of proper and detailed last-mile delivery logistics is that not planning for it properly can adversely affect human life and make it hard for the governing bodies to plan for and regular cities so as to elevate them to the current smart city ideals. These are some of the reasons that make good last-mile delivery logistics so important:
1. Problems for normal people
The importance of last-mile delivery logistics is important from the normal person’s perspective too. The concept of e-commerce and related and unrelated deliveries is so prevalent these days that there are a number of vehicles, including transportation vehicles and delivery trucks that belong to different corporations/delivery companies in transit. Hence improper logistics can result in congestion of roads which can be very problematic to normal people especially during peak hours. There is an actual situation where such last-mile delivery vehicles have been the cause of immense traffic congestions that resulted in an increase in commute times by a few hours. Hence, the importance of sustainable last-mile delivery options, especially in cities with already bad commute times, cannot be stressed enough.
2. Disastrous effects from the environmental perspective
The environment can also be on the receiving end in case of improper planning and execution of last-mile deliveries. Air pollution is one of the most acute problems in most of the global cities these days with the air quality in many cities being too poor for human habitation. In such a dire situation delivery trucks and transportation vehicles idling due to traffic, congestions can cause vehicles to release massive amounts of air pollutants including greenhouse gases that can further reduce the already bad air quality. Thus, last-mile logistics are important from the environmental perspective too.
3. Customer expectations
Customers these days have very high expectations of companies, especially when it comes with delivering products. Whether we are talking about food delivery vehicles or the normal product delivery, concepts like Amazon Prime with the promise of same-day delivery and 30-minutes delivery (when it comes to food) is in some ways inflating customer expectations. So, proper last-mile delivery planning and implementation are essential as it has a large enough impact on the speed of delivery and thus customer satisfaction. And in a situation where there are unlimited choices for the same product, customers have the luxury of throwing brand-loyalty to the wind and exploring options more in-line with their expectations.
4. Inflated costs for corporations
Given that the concept of last-mile delivery is so important for customer satisfaction and customer retention, most corporations invest a lot into this aspect of the business. There is a lot of financial investment from the corporations all through the planning, partnership with delivery companies and the actual execution of the deliveries. This means that any delays even by a few hours can cost the businesses in the tune of millions and billions. Minor issues like problems during transportation or delay due to traffic congestions, etc. can be financially detrimental for the company. Thus, proper last-mile delivery logistics is important from the company’s perspective too.
Thus it is obvious that sustainable last-mile delivery options are important on many counts and improper planning and implementation can cause inconvenience on a small scale and harm on a large scale to many different entities like customers; the company involves the common people and even the environment.

Scooters are driving the recent micromobility revolution — but don’t count out the humble bike just yet.
By Kea Wilson

Between 2018 and 2019, the number of total microtransit trips on American streets soared from 84 million to 136 million, according to the National Association of City Transportation Officials, but bikeshare grew a respectable 10 percent, even as the number of bikeshare systems shrank four percent overall. Scooter trips, though, more than doubled over the same period, as a combination of venture capital and growing revenues sent scooters rolling through more cities across America than ever before.
The numbers represent a clear win for safe and sustainable transportation overall, since 45 percent of riders surveyed for the study said their scooter or bike trip had replaced a car trip. But for some cycling advocates, it brought up troubling questions about why one of the most time-tested transportation technologies isn’t seeing the same scale of growth — and what the e-scooter’s recent success means for the long-term role of sharing systems in the active transportation world.
On the one hand, the runaway success of the e-scooter might just be a matter of basic economics. Industry insiders say the typical dockless e-scooter costs roughly half as much to manufacture as the average shared, dockless bicycle — and docked bikeshare cycles, which are the mode of choice in most city-subsidized systems, can cost far more. Given that riders are willing to pay roughly the same amount for both modes, the e-scooter can give a corporation a lot more bang for its buck — and corporations can then afford to put a lot more vehicles on the streets, within easy reach of would-be riders.
“Dockless scooters have caught on for a simple reason — because they’re readily available when they’re deciding how to make a trip,” said Adam Kovacevich, Lime’s head of government relations. “Our hope is, someday, you’ll leave your building, and when you look left and look right, there’s a scooter. Proximity is massively important for driving usage, and that’s an inherent limitation of the docked model that we see in so many bike shares.”
But Lime hasn’t experienced equal financial success with all dockless vehicles. Back when it was still called “Limebike,” the micromobility giant famously abandoned its first-gen dockless bike fleets in many cities before deploying oodles of cheaper e-scooters in U.S. cities instead. Now, the company is experimenting with bikes in a limited number of communities again, but vehicles with footboards still outnumber vehicles with pedals in virtually all of its fleets.
The company insists that cost considerations aren’t the only reason why it made the shift — and that public preference for scooters has been the primary driving force.
“If you compare the usage per vehicle per day, scooters attract more riders — there’s no doubt,” said Kovacevich. “The investment in scooters was really driven by how popular they were amongst the public. Some people seem to look at a bike and think it’s going to require more work than they’re really willing to put in; maybe they’re dressed nicely for the day and don’t want to get sweaty, for instance. I’m not sure that all cities have fully appreciated just how popular scooters are with the public as a way to get around.”
But that popularity probably has something to do with the sheer proliferation of scooters on U.S. streets, too. Practically since they launched, scooter companies have saturated cities with as many vehicles as possible to put them within easy, convenient reach of riders — a strategy that’s prohibitively expensive to do with shared bicycles, much less bikes that sit on spendy-yet-durable docks.
Still, flooding the zone has its limits. NACTO found that after the number of scooters on the streets hit a certain critical mass unique to each city, the average rides per vehicle per day dropped off sharply. Ridership in the bikeshare networks in the study sample, by contrast, tended to grow as the number of available bikes and docking stations did — and among the most successful cities, that growth didn’t appear to be close to reaching a ceiling.
“Scooters really tapped into that lightning rod of latent demand for non-driving — and because they could deploy vehicles very quickly, they did so very quickly,” said Caroline Samponaro, head of micromobility policy for Lyft, which runs some of the nation’s most successful bikeshare companies in addition to a fleet of scooters. “But scooters don’t have the network effect that docked bikeshare has, where as the fleet expands, the ridership expands.”
That impressive network effect, though, may not be universal. NACTO found that a stunning 87 percent of bike share trips in 2019 took place in just six regions: the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Chicago, Honolulu, New York, and Washington, D.C. And in all of them besides Honolulu, the community has contracted with Lyft as its micromobility operator — and Samponaro says that’s a testament to those cities’ willingness to follow Lyft’s recipe for bikeshare success.
“The public-private partnerships in all these cities aren’t identical, but what they all have in common is they’re long term agreements, and we’re the only provider giving the city this service,” Samponaro says. “That gives us the ability to think with a city, long term, about what they want their whole transportation network to look like. Scooters have typically be rolled out on a six month horizon, maybe a 12 month horizon. They’re very much trying to capture that initial interest; that’s their focus, rather than the long term.”
There may be no better testament to the success of Lyft’s approach than its Citi Bike program in New York City, which NACTO found to have the single largest ridership of any bikeshare company in the U.S. last year. And Samponaro says it’s no accident that the program’s success has been mirrored by continual enhancement in the Big Apple’s bike lane network.
“The other key to success that’s important to call out is that the period of time in which we’ve grown Citibike is exactly the same period of time in which we worked with the city to make a lot of infrastructure improvements,” Samponaro said. “It’s a virtuous cycle; potential riders are seeing signals on the street that bikes belong on the street, and then the bikes are right there for them to ride.”
That virtuous cycle has also made cycling in New York more gender-diverse — something that NACTO found scooter companies are struggling with. In surveys of markets across the U.S., the association consistently found that riders were between 66 and 81 percent male.
“When we introduced protected bike lanes, we also saw twice as many women riding,” Samponaro said. So we’ve seen bike share start to look more and more like New York City itself, every day.”
But micromobility companies emphasize that at the end of the day, bike share and scooter share are not fundamentally in competition with one another, because bikes tend to be popular for longer trips, and scooters for shorter ones. And what all riders can probably agree on is how exciting it is to have a solo transportation option that’s safe, affordable, and green — unlike driving a car.

A rise of connected data and devices means more opportunity to leverage technology to improve our communities 
By Sue Weston 
Data analysis has become so common we often take it for granted. By revealing trends and patterns, applications can predict weather and allow us to navigate traffic. Information from COVID tests is used to reduce the spread of disease. We can even use this data to enhance the quality of life, solve environmental issues, and improve commerce, especially as we enter the new normal.
Increasingly, government agencies are collaborating with technology providers to create smart cities that support vibrant communities.
The concept of smart cities is not new. It began in 1970 in LA with the first big data project. Then in 1994, Amsterdam created a virtual digital city to promote internet usage. Increasingly, smart cities are springing up across the globe to specifically address each community’s unique needs.[ Keep up on the latest thought leadership, insights, how-to, and analysis on IT through CIO’s newsletters. ]
The intelligence in these municipalities comes from connecting devices and using data purposefully to make informed decisions. Here are some examples of how smart cities are using data to improve communities:
Reducing crime: by mapping crimes, law enforcement can anticipate incidents before they occur. Ballistics matching can identify guns used in multiple crimes and get the guns off the streets.Enhancing mobility: sharing real-time information about delays, commuters can change their routes quickly. Congestion pricing (charging less to commute during non-peak times) and encouraging shifts in behavior.Focusing on health: monitoring health situations can promote early intervention with digital solutions. Patients with chronic conditions can use wearable devices to transmit readings to doctors.Increased environment efficiency: monitoring the consumption of water and electricity, and incenting people to conserve. Smart grids can optimize and price energy flow based on demand. Modifying traffic patterns can lower emissions, which improves air quality and overall community health.
Local governments are using smart city initiatives to create processes and policies that drive positive change. But they can’t address the issues alone.  Partnerships between government and technology are producing results.
I spoke with Paul Riser, serial entrepreneur, former Chief Information & Technology Officer of Innovation Health Technologies, and current Director at TechTown Detroit, a longstanding incubator and accelerator aimed at revitalizing Michigan’s largest city. Currently, Riser’s work is focused on leading Detroit Urban Solutions, where he is scripting the intersection of urban initiatives (including mobility, public health, energy, water tech, etc.), applying tech and smart city strategies to develop Detroit to meet the needs of its citizens.
Detroit Urban Solutions places residents first, working with stakeholders and city leaders to develop solutions to deliver a more equitable and improved quality of life. Riser’s success is in his approach, beginning by developing trusted relationships within communities and ensuring that the beneficiaries understand, embrace, and leverage technology to better their urban environment.
In Detroit and other regions, the ability to leverage technology to more effectively manage communities will become even more important as we rebound from the pandemic. Technologists may offer the secret sauce to navigate these uncertain times, by choreographing the collaboration between technology, business, and government, where each plays a different role. 
Governments provide laws, policies, and maintain the infrastructure. Businesses focus on generating revenue, selling products, and attracting clients. Technologists will build the infrastructure and, importantly, manage data privacy, which is paramount for maintaining public trust and confidence in smart cities.
Metadata, automation, and policy-driven control and configuration are key to improving data management and boosting innovation.
The internet generates large quantiles of data that can track our every movement, our searches, who are our friends, and our preferences. It can tell just about everything. Because it is not always possible to strip personal identification from data, technologists need to create protocols which protect the public and keep private data private.   
Confidentiality of data must be safeguarded.Cybersecurity needs to be maintained to prevent a data breach..
By 2050 it is expected that 68% of the world’s population will live in cities. These increases in urban populations will put a strain on the infrastructure, schools, hospitals, and transportation. Smart cities provide effective solutions for managing urban growth. 
And technologists will be at the forefront of helping to manage these initiatives, working alongside urban planners to regulate resources, reduce pollution, and design cities where citizens can thrive. The technologists are an integral part, the silent hero, making smart cities even smart(er).

 Mobility-as-a-Service has the potential to enhance commuter travel and contribute to Singapore’s vision of a “car-lite” city. 
General Motors’ Futurama exhibit at the 1939 World’s Fair in New York City offered a vision of mobility made possible by the comfort and convenience of motor vehicles. Many ideas introduced in Futurama have since shaped the built environment around the world as cars and car ownership came to dominate the city. Road networks, motorways and ring roads now define the structure of many cities. Almost 80 years later, this car-centric utopia has brought severe side-effects, including pollution and traffic congestion.
In many modern metropolises, car ownership is no longer practical, nor desirable, but improved mobility is needed more than ever. Singapore’s urban planners have envisioned a car-lite future in which residents depend less on private car ownership and travel mainly via cycling, walking and public transport. Land, once set aside for roads and parking spaces, could instead be used for other purposes. Mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) is one such innovation that could support the car-lite push.
Shifting commuter preferences
MaaS brings together public transport with private sector offerings such as ride-sharing and bike-sharing together on one platform. By integrating end-to-end trip planning, booking, electronic ticketing, and payment services across all modes of transportation—be it public, private or on-demand—MaaS can facilitate seamless travel and help mitigate some first-mile and last-mile challenges.
As our transit infrastructure continues to evolve, both our habits and ways of getting around are also shifting. Our view of the “last mile” has changed over time and how we interact with technology is changing our mobility future, which may help the adoption of MaaS, as commuters increasingly favour access to services over ownership1.
Dr Maria Kamargianni, Assistant Professor in Transport and Energy and Head of MaaSLab, Energy Institution at University College London, agrees. “Car ownership is not that popular anymore. It causes a lot of pain points and it increases a lot of expenses of the households”, she explains.
A shift in commuter preferences may already be happening. A recent Land Transport Authority (LTA) survey showed that trips made via private vehicles dipped for the first time in almost two decades in 2016, while public transport journeys hit a record high in the same year2. Users can also benefit from the convenience when it comes to payment as they can easily pay via a single interface.
Besides enhancing the travel experience of commuters, MaaS can improve the city by reducing vehicle ownership and the need for car parks, in turn bringing down traffic congestion. Public spaces can then be redesigned to be more pedestrian-oriented and cyclist-friendly. Of course, fewer cars on the roads would also translate to better air quality and a reduced carbon footprint.
Global application of MaaS
MaaS has already made inroads in various cities around the world, albeit at the prototype stage. In the United States, ride sharing companies Via, Lyft and Uber are testing out MaaS by offering shared passes that integrate other forms of transportation such as bicycles and electric bikes, and are beginning to integrate public transport.
Sampo Hietanen, the co-founder of Finnish company MaaS Global, explains that one of the main challenges of MaaS adoption is getting public and private players on board, which requires data sharing among partners to be able to integrate ticketing and payment services, as well as streamlined regulation to create a level playing field.
Hietanen also believes that one key element that many MaaS operators have missed is the element of freedom, which MaaS Global’s app, Whim, hopes to address. Whim allows residents to plan and pay for all modes of public and private transportation from its platform. In Helsinki, where Whim has been on trial since 2016, users can choose between a pay-as-you-go plan, or pay €49 ($75) per month for a package that includes public transit, bike-share, and limited ride-sharing. A €499 per month package replaces personal car ownership by including unlimited taxi and car-sharing.
“Within the subscription world, to be able to really compete against car ownership, there has to be an element of individual freedom. That means we will not have only one subscription to fit them all. The idea is to have a huge variety, from the really high-end packages to really affordable ones. But the same basic idea has to be there – that you have a sense of freedom anywhere, anytime, on a whim”, Hietanen explains.
“We envisage Singapore to be the first real big city where we get to really show the world how disruption in transportation really looks like – bringing convenience, individual freedom, but also system benefits. And the city has a chance of looking better”, Hietanen says.
Potential of MaaS in Singapore
“Urban planning plays an important role when it comes to the success of MaaS”, says Colin Lim, CEO of mobilityX, a SMRT seed-funded start-up that aims to provide MaaS solutions to both commuters and companies.
MobilityX is currently working with Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and JTC Corporation to pilot a MaaS project through Jalan and JalanX. Jalan is an app that integrates train and bus networks with next-generation transport modes, including autonomous vehicles, bicycle-sharing systems and personal mobility devices such as e-scooters, while JalanX is an experimental on-demand bus service serving NTU’s campus and JTC’s CleanTech Park, connecting them to residential estates.
On the NTU campus, Lim and his team are exploring the idea of building car parks at each of the university’s defined entrances, where commuters can park their cars and continue their journey within the campus using other transport modes. With a good internal transport system consisting of shared scooters, bikes, on-demand bus services, and autonomous vehicles, a car-lite framework would be more feasible, he explains.
LTA is already rolling out dedicated cycling networks across public housing estates and is redesigning road spaces to be more pedestrian-oriented and cyclist-friendly3. With more people-friendly infrastructure, MaaS has the potential to facilitate seamless point-to-point journeys. One example of this might be building stations for shared scooters and bicycles at MRT stations, which would allow consumers to unlock a shared bike, cycle to the MRT station and board the train seamlessly, Mr Lim says.
With a wide range of transport services already available in Singapore, Dr Kamargianni believes that the country will be able to meet commuter demand if MaaS is launched. With the country’s high population density, and strict policies on car ownership and car growth, effective implementation of MaaS is possible, but only if the issue of combining all existing modes of transport can be integrated on into a single platform can be resolved, she explains.
Hence, MaaS has the potential to contribute towards Singapore’s car-lite vision by inducing people to drive less, or perhaps not get a car at all, which would free up land resources and reduce pollution by shifting commuters towards more sustainable forms of transport. However, policymakers must continue to work closely with transport operators, data providers and research bodies to ensure its effective and efficient implementation.

Using technology to improve last mile metrics is essential to driving last mile costs down, but how do shippers know if the technology is helping or hurting? The answer to this question lies in using last mile metrics to track key performance indicators and target levels of service to ensure accountability, visibility and continued reduction of costs in last mile delivery.
A recent survey of customer service experiences, reports DC Velocity, revealed many retailers feel current technologies do not address their customer service needs, and as few as 3 percent of retailers site full support as part of their current systems. Unfortunately, history teaches shippers that reducing costs means cutting customer service, but integrating customer service data into delivery operations and transportation systems is key to increasing a brand’s value. In fact, 72 percent of survey respondents believe it is very important to improve access to data for in-transit shipments, which includes last mile delivery. Essentially, shippers need to track these 11 metrics.
1. On-Time Deliveries Are King of Last Mile Metrics
The number of on-time felt or late deliveries are more important than any other metric tracked in last mile logistics. These metrics provide a quick yes or no analysis of the effectivity of your last mile logistics strategy.
2. Fuel Consumption Rates
Last mile metrics involving fuel consumption rates can vary and depend on the preference of the company, but how fuel consumption rates are calculated can greatly influence whether a driver is saving or wasting fuel.
For example, overall fuel consumption costs may be lower, but interval-based fuel consumption rates could show consistent, stopping and starting patterns that do not coincide with existing routes and drive up fuel costs. As a result, fuel consumption rates should be calculated by averaging the total fuel costs per driver, all drivers, per delivery vehicle and per route.
3. Last Mile Vehicle Capacity Used Versus Available
Last mile logistics should also consider the capacity utilized against the available capacity in all last mile delivery vans. This metric is calculated by dividing the available capacity by the total capacity. Excess available capacity rates allude to poor loading procedures or the need to consolidate routes. The same calculation is used to calculate capacity used, dividing the capacity used by total capacity.
4. Planned Versus Actual Mileage
Planned versus actual mileage last mile metrics are calculated by dividing the actual mileage per vehicle, driver or route by its own planned mileage. Higher actual mileage rates reveal problems with route planning or unforeseen detours to route schedules.
5. Driver Hours In-Motion and Stationary
In-motion and stationary driving hours are expenses in last mile logistics, and unless your company employs a fully autonomous and drone-assisted delivery network, stops are necessary in last mile logistics. However, the amount of stops and hours of both in-motion and stationary position can help measure performance of drivers. Excess stationary hours or excess in-motion hours. These metrics are calculated by dividing the total amount of time drivers spend on a route by the number of hours in motion and the number of hours stationary.
6. Cost Per Item, Per Mile, and Per Vehicle
Last mile metrics should track the cost per item, per mile and vehicle associated with a specific route and the company as a whole. As a result, shippers should average the total costs per item for a given route and for the company’s shipments over a set period. The same average process should apply to both mile and per vehicle metrics too.
7. Number of Stops
Last mile logistics and metrics should also track the number of stops per vehicle. This is important to monitoring fuel costs, but it can also allude to poor route optimization practices. In other words, vehicles with a high number of stops should be reevaluated for ways to improve route schedules.
8. Average Service Time
The average Service time metric can be complicated because it involves different data to calculate, depending on the source of an order. Most commonly, it is calculated by dividing the total service time at the store by the total number of deliveries. In other words, what is the average amount of time spent per order between the store, the warehouse and other pre-shipping processes?
9. Customer Complaints
The need to manage customer service and address customer complaints leads to another metric in last mile logistics, reports Talking Points With Adrian Gonzalez. What is the total number of customer complaints, and how do they stack up against the total number of deliveries. This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deliveries by the total number of complaints received.
10. Order Accuracy
Order accuracy is calculated by comparing the known inaccuracies of orders against all shipped orders. Since some consumers may never report inaccurate orders, it is difficult to track a specific order inaccuracy metric. Instead, shippers should track order accuracy rates by dividing the total number of shipped orders by the number of orders not subject to customer service disputes, calls or complaints.
11. Damage Claims
A final last mile metrics to track is also about problems with orders, damage claims. Shippers should track the number of incoming damage claims against the total number of shipments. This is calculated by dividing the number of damaged claims by the total number of shipments. The resulting value is the percentage of damage claims in decimal form.
Using Metrics, Shippers Can Improve Last Mile Logistics
Metrics allow shippers to understand the ins and outs of last mile logistics, and metrics provide a means of measuring the performance of last mile Logistics plans against actual processes and their associated costs. As a result, shippers can make changes to their operations to improve last mile services through last mile metrics, and knowing more about last mile needs is key to providing more than just the standard last mile delivery options.

The system utilises AI, big data and 5G initiatives to help automated traffic flows and alleviate congestion
Huawei has launched its Intelligent Traffic Management Solution for overseas markets to address the challenges of traffic law enforcement, traffic violation inspection and traffic control with advanced technologies including big data, AI, cloud and 5G.
During the current Covid 19 pandemic, ICT technologies such as cloud computing, big data and artificial intelligence have played an important role in epidemic prevention and control, making governments and enterprises around the world realise that digital transformation is inevitable. With the economy recovering and markets resuming, a safe and operational transportation system is essential.
“Smooth and orderly traffic is a key prerequisite for the next round of economic recovery. Huawei’s Intelligent Traffic Management Solution adopts a variety of new technologies, such as AI and big data, to transform traffic management from experience-based to intelligent, and from “looking for a needle in a haystack” to “precisely guided operations,” said York Yuekun, president of Huawei Global Government Business Unit.
As one of the largest industrial cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Yanbu deployed Huawei’s Intelligent Traffic Management System in 2019.
“Our goal is to build Yanbu into one of the safest cities in the world. To achieve this goal, we need to ensure road safety and provide an efficient and safe traffic environment for our people. After the deployment of Huawei’s Intelligent Traffic Management System in 2019, it achieved remarkable results within a few months,” said Engr. Thamer Anwar Noori, manager of communication & emergency system, industrial security and safety, at the Royal Commission at Yanbu.
Transforming road traffic management & safety digitalisation through Huawei Intelligent Traffic Management Solution
Road traffic management and safety is always among the top priority for many governments around the world as it has a direct impact on life quality. Huawei is working closely with our ecosystem partners to develop the Intelligent Traffic Management Solution (ITMS), supporting system integration upon an open platform.
Among Huawei ITMS partners is Hawkie Shang, vice president of E-Hualu International Technology Co., Ltd.
“Traffic and human resources are inseparable. Intelligent off-site law enforcement reduces human resource requirements in traffic management. In the future, we will use big data to perform in-depth relationship analysis in core business domains and use AI to usher in a new era of urban traffic management,” he said.
Augustine Chiew, APAC & Russia Lead, Government Business, Huawei, elaborated on Huawei’s Intelligent Traffic Management Solution, “The solution consists of three parts, namely ‘Sharp Eyes’, a ‘Powerful Brain’, and ‘Intelligent and Simplified O&M.’ The ‘Sharp Eyes’ module replaces traditional single functionality sensors with intelligent sensors that support deployment of multiple algorithms to better detect violations and collect comprehensive traffic information. The ‘Powerful Brain’ module process and analyses large amount of traffic data in real-time, enhancing traffic managers’ ability to make better and more accurate decisions. The ‘Intelligent and Simplified O&M’ module uses integrated sites and the eSight O&M platform to support fast and seamless deployment, and E2E multi-dimensional management.”

 Cities are getting more crowded. Already, more than half the world’s population lives in urban areas and this number is expected to increase to two thirds by 2050. With pressure increasing on public services and infrastructure, cities have been looking for innovative, future-proofing solutions.  
Driven by rapid advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) technology, cloud computing and network connectivity, smart city projects are setting out to overcome these issues and make cities cleaner, more efficient and better coordinated.
Wealth of benefits
Smart cities offer many benefits to their populations. According to McKinsey, in Paris, the average citizen spends four years of their life trying to find a parking space. In cities like Geneva, smart parking solutions use IoT to alert drivers of free spaces. Chicago is one of many cities replacing its street lights with intelligent controls which respond to the amount of people on the street, allowing governing bodies to save money on lighting empty streets. Meanwhile, smart waste management in the likes of Denmark and Sharjah is harnessing solar power and sensors to enable public bins to send alerts when they are full and to reduce garbage trucks on the street.
Overcoming obstacles
As we look at future development, however, it’s clear there are a number of challenges. Aside from the internal politics and bureaucracy involved in such wide scale collaboration, security remains a major concern. The only way to realise the potential of smart cities is to have a robust system for data sharing between governments, city planners, businesses providing solutions and developers. However, pooling of data from many sources makes it more difficult to ensure water-tight security. In addition, when breaches occur, cyber criminals have access to more sources of data through the interdependent network. Apart from hardwiring security into the design, the most promising solutions on the horizon are AI-based. These solutions act like a digital immune system for the smart city organism. Today’s digital immune system is based on Artificial Intelligence and is not only more sophisticated, but also more preventative by design. Rather than waiting for a virus or an attack to happen, it learns what’s ‘normal’ for the system, in order to detect and fight back against any ‘abnormal’ detections in real time. Anything from an anomalous device, to uncharacteristically large file transfers can issue security warnings and enable attacks to be shut down as, or before, they happen.One of the perceived hurdles to smart city development can be complexity. Historic cities are built upon centuries of legacy infrastructure, but while this poses a challenge to smart platforms, it’s still possible to overcome with government backing and legislation. Transport for London (TFL) in the UK, once a crumbling, Victorian-age transport system, is now one of the most successful open data organisations in the world. The Traffic Management Act of 2004 was instrumental in this, requiring municipalities to work together and share data on traffic flows, planned road works and bus timetables. By pooling this information and making it public, developers were able to create smart tools such as CityMapper, which provides citizens with real-time data on urban transport, including live bus and train timetables and traffic information. Clean air: the smart city driver
TFL is an example of how governmental action can drive forward smart city initiatives, but to date, there hasn’t been impetus which has made smart cities a global priority. In the face of many conflicting priorities, there needs to be a strong enough drive and demonstrable value for governments to invest money into the smart city cause. While one of those drivers we are seeing today is improved traffic management, it’s looking increasingly likely that the cause which will really drive smart city innovation will be air quality.As city populations become increasingly concerned about the side effects of pollution, air quality has become a political issue on the centrestage. Smart cities offer an infrastructure which supports goals to reduce air pollution in numerous ways: from introducing buildings with smarter environmental managements, to enabling drone deliveries which take cars and motorbikes off the road.

On the horizon
So, what does the next generation of smart city innovations look like? Autonomous cars are a vital part of visions for the future. For example, according to KPMG, the UAE has ranked eighth globally for readiness to accommodate driverless vehicles, as a result of Dubai’s Autonomous Transportation Strategy that will help cut costs by 44 per cent, resulting in savings of up to $245 million a year.Drones will also play an important role in the future of the smart city: developers are mimicking the behaviour of insects to develop sophisticated drones which can complete dangerous maintenance work, or act as an autonomic extension of human workers. In addition, drones will increasingly be seen on the consumer market and by 2050 will take over home delivery. Meanwhile, human movement will be used to improve public transport. Using sensors throughout the city, data will be collected about the flow of human traffic moving towards the tubes or trains and request more services to manage it. This will allow cities to react more dynamically to crowding and also save money on dispatching services where there’s no demand.But to achieve these visions for the future, a leap is needed. The sheer volume of connected devices needed to create future smart cities would put unsurmountable pressure on networks available today. The only way to support the vision is to provide more bandwidth, faster speed and lower latency through 5G. 
Conclusion
The evolution of a city is an unstoppable journey; faced with the stark reality of urbanisation, the next chapter is to harness technology to make cities smarter. While today, there are many individual examples of smart initiative success, what is needed is a cause which motivates governments to join the drive for progress. Looking to the near future, it’s likely that citizens, lobbying for cleaner air in increasingly crowded cities, will play a crucial role in driving that change. While the road remains challenging, with a motivated governing body, true collaboration and the rollout of 5G, the door is open to the future of the smart city.

Researchers at The University of Texas at Dallas say drone technology has the potential to be a genuine game changer in the retail industry, with its promise to enable retailers to offer unheard-of delivery lead times and near-perfect delivery-time customization adaptability.
In a new study, recently published online in Production and Operations Management, three faculty members from the Naveen Jindal School of Management explored how drone delivery could change retail logistics networks. The paper focuses on the use of customer-facing delivery centers, also known as last-mile warehouses.
Dr. Milind Dawande, professor of operations management and one of the paper’s co-authors, said last-mile retail delivery via drones is being viewed as a truly disruptive technology. Retailers worldwide are pursuing approaches to enable faster delivery, and drones arguably represent the most encouraging technological innovation toward this goal, he said.
The study found that both the number of last-mile warehouses and the delivery speed of the drones will increase as technology matures. In other words, last-mile delivery networks will become more decentralized, with drones operating at increasingly faster speeds.
The analysis also showed that while perfect customization of delivery-time guarantees is more profitable, retailers can capture a sizeable portion of the profit by partitioning their market into a few zones and offering the best-possible delivery-time guarantee for each zone.
“If a retailer promises each customer a different delivery time based on the customer’s location, that would be perfect customization,” Dawande said. “For example, a retailer could give any customer who is 1 mile away a delivery-time guarantee of five minutes and a customer 1.5 miles away a delivery-time guarantee of seven minutes. While perfect customization is theoretically best for the retailer, it is impractical. Instead, the retailer might offer all customers less than 5 miles away a guaranteed delivery time of 15 minutes.
“In other words, limited customization is good enough.”
“For example, a retailer could give any customer who is 1 mile away a delivery-time guarantee of five minutes and a customer 1.5 miles away a delivery-time guarantee of seven minutes. While perfect customization is theoretically best for the retailer, it is impractical. Instead, the retailer might offer all customers less than 5 miles away a guaranteed delivery time of 15 minutes. In other words, limited customization is good enough.”Dr. Milind Dawande, professor of operations management in the Naveen Jindal School of Management
Faster delivery times are more profitable because it implies more demand, Dawande said. Customers’ needs are time-sensitive. For example, if a retailer promises delivery of a book in 15 minutes, the demand is likely to go up, as compared to a three-day delivery promise.
The researchers note that increasing delivery speed of drones can help improve profitability only if it is accompanied by an increase in the number of last-mile warehouses. Therefore, in congested markets, where the number of warehouses cannot be increased, the retailer may find it best to offer a delivery speed that is lower than the highest-possible speed.  
Before drone technology can become widely adopted, however, privacy and safety issues need to be solved, Dawande said, as well as regulations coordinating drone travel and the public perception of fleets of drones flying overhead. The paper points to pilot programs testing the technology.
“It would be reasonable to assume that drone technology is maturing quickly, and we should see a commercial rollout on a larger scale in the not-too-distant future. The COVID-19 pandemic will perhaps hasten this process,” said Dawande, who is also the Mike Redeker Distinguished Professor in Management.
Drones might be particularly appealing to customers concerned about both delivery safety and delivery speed, he said. Hands-free delivery to one’s doorstep will be an advantage drones can offer in the post-COVID-19 era.
The analysis is also applicable to other dedicated delivery vehicles, such as delivery robots and electric bikes, which many retailers are testing.
The researchers noted that further research is needed into how last-mile delivery capacity might be allocated between drones and traditional approaches such as delivery trucks. On the one hand, drone delivery can enable fast delivery times and minimize the cost of human labor by using dedicated aerial vehicles that fly directly from a delivery center to the customer’s location. On the other hand, delivery trucks have the capability of making multiple stops during a trip. The researchers predict that retailers will use both in order to benefit from their respective strengths.

Last-mile delivery is the most inefficient process for more than half of North American Transportation & Logistics companies, says a new global report commissioned by SOTI in partnership with Arlington Research.
STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER FOR TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS COMPANIES AS CONSUMER HABITS SHIFT 
In an era where e-commerce is exploding and consumers are expecting rapid, often same-day deliveries, the report titled The Last Mile Sprint: State of Mobility in Transportation and Logistics, said 78 percent of companies in Canada in Transportation & Logistics say last-mile delivery is the most inefficient process of the entire supply chain. In comparison, 59 percent of those companies in the U.S. felt that way.
“The stakes have never been higher for transportation and logistics companies in North America as consumers increasingly embrace a delivery culture,” said Shash Anand, Vice President of Product Strategy, SOTI, the world’s most trusted provider of mobile and IoT management solutions, with more than 17,000 enterprise customers and millions of devices managed worldwide.
“By implementing a robust mobile-first strategy, companies will not only be able to provide better customer experiences, but will increase speed, minimize costs, ensure transparency in the delivery channel for the customer and end consumer, and edge out the competition.
“Ensuring your technology is constantly updated and having an integrated mobility and IoT management platform in place is an effective operations strategy that helps minimize disruptions to your business and maintain high levels of customer satisfaction.”
Companies such as ShipperBee have launched in an Uber-like way, though ShipperBee is currently operating in the Greater Toronto Area only though it has plans to expand.
Gary Newbury, a retail supply chain strategist and serial transformation executive, said he agreed with the survey’s main point; the last-mile delivery is the most inefficient process in the retail supply chain. And Canadians tended to be much more aware of the gaps.
“The volume of online versus total retail in Canada has historically been below five percent (up to COVID-19). Much of the approach retailers have taken has been focused on the ‘marketing’ side of the digital business stream. As a result the assumption for many retailers has been ‘it’s just a small change and so we can bolt it onto our existing distribution network’,” he said. “And to a degree, they were able to think this is all they needed to do with relatively low/incidental volumes. Retailers brought in digital marketing experts, but not digital fulfillment experts. To cover for this knowledge gap they tended to either try and ‘skunk work’, a fulfillment process internally (bending process and systems to accommodate), or relied on a third party logistics provider to do the heavy lifting, relying on their tech platform for ‘visibility’ of shipping through to the doorstep. Often, the retailer may have found their tech platform was more geared towards B2B tracking, rather than B2C.
“Approaching a key future line of revenue in this ad hoc way has exposed many retailers to an unprofitable business stream, and as they attempted to scale this, the losses just got worse, the customer service often suffered, through lack of transparency of where their order was in the fulfillment process. For many consumers, up to COVID-19, it has been a hit and miss process.
“The reason why I think they got this wrong is retailers’ distribution networks are designed to move mass merchandising from Point A (a supplier) to Point B (a store) via a distribution centre. Typically, the lowest unit that is shipped in this way is a case. Online is very different, it is all about individual pieces, and often a localized mixed, being ordered electronically, with an expectation of speed, to either the store (for pick up) or to a point of convenience (such as a residential address).”
COVID—19 HAS EXPOSED THE RETAILERS WHO WERE SLEEPING ON INITIATIVES SUCH AS CLICK AND COLLECT 
Newbury said, “the eComm supply chain design, for many retailers, needs a deep rethink. COVID-19 has exposed many retailers — missing the boat by not having a click and collect or home delivery service, or having services which did not scale, and where they did, caused the retailer to lose more money than staying shut”.
“It is the most labour intensive and resource consumptive part of their proposition, but rather than just have small cube, high margin products online with a scheduled service for their delivery (and restricted geographical coverage), many retailers, being under-informed about the cost profile of fulfillment of online orders, unfortunately followed the trend of other retailers and felt it was something they had to do to keep their proposition competitive,” he said.
“The rethink is to look at the stores as potential inventory distribution points, consider automation, and, currently, look into using Micro Fulfillment Centre methodology. This is not the end game, but it’s a start to bring control and predictability to the outrageous costs of manual picking in the DC and the costs of shipping lots of small individually packed orders across Canada, of often low margin products.
“The rethink must return to a re-evaluation of the retailing proposition and what is required to be presented in store and that which is presented online. Often retailers, desperate for extra sales extend the online assortment which serves to compound complexity and drive high costs in serving customers.”
Newbury said there are five or six key areas for retailers to address before they can turn a profit on online orders:
Financial record-keeping can hide the end to end costs of fulfilling online orders – when there is a spike in demand, extra costs are surfaced in fulfilling demand;SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) proliferation – retailers must look carefully at what their overall proposition is and how this is presented “in store” and online. Often online (extended aisles) can cause significant complexity and cost. Consumers are very savvy and, within a click, they can pick off all the low margin items and switch to other retailers (i.e. they will split their baskets to maximize their shopping dollars/value);High customer acquisition costs compared to life-time value (e.g. Wayfair);On demand fulfillment versus scheduled fulfillment – the choice of strategy can have a big impact on capacity, customer satisfaction and costs – retailers need to think carefully how best to structure their fulfillment processes to best optimize their proposition;Free delivery, porch piracy and “hassle free” returns – there’s not such a thing as a free lunch in business, nor is there in the virtual world; and“I mindfully add a sixth component in the sense that retailers know stores, what they know less of is digital. Approaching online as a bolt on is the worst of all worlds. Using a case/pallet distribution network for singles fulfillment will stop retailers growing online business, profitably. It looks good on paper, but the execution can be seriously profit draining.”
Some other key findings from the SOTI research include: 
82 percent of respondents in the U.S. and 88 percent in Canada agreed that it is critical for T&L companies to ensure a mobile-first strategy around last-mile delivery. A mobile-first strategy is defined as viewing smartphones, tablets and task-specific apps as the primary tools for getting work done;Companies know that a mobile-first strategy for last-mile delivery can transform their business operations. 74 percent in the U.S. and 80 percent in Canada agree that their organization would benefit, or have already benefited, from an effective mobile-first strategy for last-mile delivery. 49 percent of respondents in North America with a mobile-first strategy in place for last-mile delivery said that it has effectively reduced their operational costs;In North America, more than half (58 percent) of T&L professionals said a mobile-first strategy has enabled them to gain visibility into critical aspects of their supply chain; and49 percent of T&L companies globally said their technology is outdated. In Canada, nearly 68 percent of T&L companies indicated their technology is outdated, and 41 percent in the U.S.

Cough medicine, snacks, baking ingredients: Kelly Passek has shopping delivered weekly to her yard in Christiansburg, Virginia – by a drone.
The flying vehicle comes with little fuss, hovering briefly over her yard and letting down its package. “It’s very fast – even the noise you hear is no more than 30 seconds,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
The service is a pilot project by Google parent Alphabet Inc’s drone delivery business Wing, which is operating similar projects in Finland and Australia.
In Christiansburg, residents who sign up can get drone delivery from a locally owned businesses, a national pharmacy and FedEx.
As with other autonomous delivery services, both airborne and terrestrial, Wing has seen a major uptick in interest amid the coronavirus pandemic, as emergency regulations keep people at home and complicate many of the simplest tasks.
“For a while, they (Wing) were the only one with toilet paper. It turned from being a novelty to being a service that’s used because it’s necessary,” said Passek, whose first drone delivery was in October.
The pandemic also got Passek, a public school librarian, thinking beyond the confines of her home, as her school system changed to distance learning in March, raising concerns about how students would get required resources – including books.
After talks with Wing, a book delivery service began for county students in June.
“This is a perfect way to get our students the resources they need and also keep with our social distancing,” she said, adding the programme is likely to continue as county officials figure out how to re-open schools in the fall.
More than 140,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, a toll that experts warn will likely surge following recent record spikes in case numbers and an alarming rise in hospitalizations in many states.
The pandemic-era rise in focus on autonomous delivery is also prompting local officials and others to think about how these services use public space in their cities.
“Cities aren’t necessarily built for robots roaming around,” said Christopher Bruno, economic development director with Fairfax City, Virginia, which recently helped start a robot delivery service. “That’s something we’re monitoring.”
RISING DEMAND
Wing was formed in 2012, and last year it became the first drone company to be approved as an air carrier by the federal government.
Within its three-mile Christiansburg delivery area, residents can sign up for the service and get deliveries within about 10 minutes.
The project had been operating for only four months when it became clear that the coronavirus pandemic was accelerating.
In response to customer feedback, the company started to expand its product offerings, said Keith Heyde, head of Virginia operations for the company, including toys and “more food that could be readily prepared”.
They also brought in more local businesses, providing an economic lifeline for some: about a quarter of sales at a local cafe now come from drone delivery, Heyde said, while a coffee shop is selling twice as much cold brew as pre-pandemic.
Heyde confirmed that toilet paper became a major seller, as did sidewalk chalk.
Globally, the company saw demand increase 350% month over month in signups for service from February to April, he said.
ECONOMIC LIFELINE
That prospect of economic stimulus has been a draw for some pandemic-hit cities.
About 250 miles northeast of Christiansburg, Fairfax City officials struck an agreement with an autonomous delivery service of an entirely different kind: small, cube-shaped robots that slowly trundle down sidewalks and across streets.
“All of these businesses were closed and forced to social distance, so none of them could connect with their customers,” Bruno recalled thinking as the pandemic took hold.
Bruno had heard about delivery robots on the campus of a nearby university, operated by a company called Starship Technologies.
Eventually, a tie-up was born: Starship would operate a fleet of delivery robots, while the city provided a $10,000 grant so that local businesses would not initially have to pay commission.
About 15 businesses are participating – restaurants, a grocery store, and even a hair salon – within 1.5 miles of the city’s core, Bruno said.
Demand has been good enough that Starship increased the robot fleet from 15 to 20, he added.
For Jinson Chan, the service not only proved a lifeline but increased his customer base, he said – especially when Chan, whose High Side restaurant focuses on rare craft beers – asked if Starship could deliver alcohol.
“People went crazy,” Chan said. Even the robots’ limited delivery range proved important: “People who would never try us now say, ‘It’s only a mile away, so we could walk there.’ That helps grow our business.”
The pandemic has made for a “very busy” few months, said Ryan Tuohy, Starship’s senior vice president for business development, noting that “people were looking for contactless delivery options while also wanting to support local businesses.”
The company, which operates in five countries, has gained another 180,000 customers this year, he said.
A food-delivery initiative with Starship on the campus of Bowling Green State University, in Ohio, started in March and “really helped students in the early part of the stay-at-home order”, said Jon Zachrich, communications director for the school’s dining programme.
“We were trying to find creative ways for those who didn’t feel comfortable leaving their rooms or had pre-existing (medical) conditions to get access to what they needed.”
Due to popular demand, the service was eventually expanded off campus, covering about four square miles, Zachrich said.
Now, plans for re-opening the school include the robots.
‘START WITH PACKAGES’
The pandemic-era interest in package delivery has drawn attention from another key part of the autonomous industry: those developing self-driving vehicles for human use.
That was what happened with Optimus Ride, which since 2015 had focused on developing self-driving technology to move people, with limited ventures into package delivery, said co-founder and chief executive Ryan Chin.
“When the pandemic hit, what can we do? Flip it around – start with packages, groceries, prepared foods,” Chin said of how he approached a major new project at a Washington, D.C. mixed-use development called the Yards.
Optimus Ride develops large self-driving vehicles capable of seating multiple passengers – or packages.
At a housing estate for senior citizens in Fairfield, California, for instance, the company is delivering three meals a day as well as any packages that arrive via mail to the homes of a “very vulnerable population”, Chin said.
At the Yards, the company operates five days a week, delivering to residents of the development or within a 1.5-mile radius.
Every Wednesday is devoted to philanthropic work farther afield, delivering hot meals to low-income students who no longer have access to their schools, for instance, as well as bringing meal boxes with a week’s worth of food to families in insecure housing.
The programme has been “a lifeline for our most vulnerable neighbors”, said Christy Respress, executive director of the non-profit Pathways to Housing DC, which partners on the initiative.
For Chin, the increased use of autonomous vehicles will show local leaders what may have to change in urban areas to ease use of these services in future – around curb access, for instance.
“These vehicles have the power to change the streetscape in a very fundamental way – it will take some time, though.”

Amazon aims to lower transportation costs and complete the last mile of delivery with autonomous technology. COVID-19 could accelerate its adoption.
While high-profile companies such as Tesla, Uber and Google’s Waymo have hyped their progress toward building autonomous vehicles, Amazon has quietly pieced together an ambitious strategy that could disrupt multiple industries.
The Amazon ecosystem could one day encompass autonomous long-haul trucking and last-mile delivery to its customers. Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant could become the dominant user interface between self-driving cars and a larger app-store ecosystem that extends to smart homes. And the AWS cloud could become the central repository for the storage and processing of all the data that will be generated by the connected car.
Amazon has been largely tightlipped about its plans, but analysts predict that as the company optimizes and automates its delivery systems, it will one day challenge companies like FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service for dominance in the third-party package delivery market.
Add to this the COVID-19 pandemic, which is a wild card that could accelerate the adoption of autonomous technologies in general. This is particularly true for last-mile delivery, as a way of minimizing the potential for transmission of the disease through human-to-human contact, said Oliver Mitchell, founding partner in the venture capital firm Autonomy Ventures.
“Who are the companies that are going to come out and the technologies that are going to come out more valuable to society in the post-COVID world? It’s clear that Amazon is almost like a necessary resource in this world of social distancing,” Mitchell said.
Amazon has tested a variety of technologies aimed at automating the logistics of package delivery, such as the use of pick-and-pack robots in the warehouse, long-haul trucks, last-mile delivery vehicles and drones, Mitchell said. The technology isn’t there yet in terms of a fully automated system, but it’s moving fast, and Amazon has established a leadership position, he said.
What’s in it for Amazon?
Even prior to the worldwide pandemic, Amazon was already highly motivated to reduce its transportation costs, which have risen rapidly due to demand for one-day delivery of goods and two-hour delivery for Amazon Prime customers with the Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service. Amazon’s transportation costs were a whopping $27.7 billion in fiscal 2018 and global shipping costs for the holiday quarter of 2019 soared to $11 billion, according to the company’s earnings report.
According to a recent McKinsey study, deployment of autonomous vehicles for last-mile delivery could reduce transportation costs by as much as 40%. In an attempt to rein in these costs, Amazon has invested in its own cargo jets, freight shipping and trailer trucks. The company cut ties with FedEx and scaled back the number of packages it delivers via the U.S. Postal Service.
Amazon’s autonomous driving moves
On the autonomous driving front, Amazon has a multi-pronged approach that involves almost everything except building its own self-driving vehicles.
Signs of the company’s moves into the autonomous vehicle market started in 2015, when Amazon filed for a patent for autonomous lane-switching technology. The company was granted the patent in 2017.
At the Consumer Electronics Show in 2018, Amazon disclosed a partnership with Toyota and demoed a vehicle called e-Palette, a multifunction, autonomous minivan designed to move goods, people or act as a mobile office or hotel room.
Also in 2018, Amazon filed a patent for software that would personalize the autonomous vehicle experience. Amazon executives explained that drivers have different preferences for how they want an autonomous vehicle to operate and said the patent would enable individualized passenger profiles. The system could detect a passenger’s identity in a number of ways, including voice recognition, facial recognition or biometric data.
In January 2019, Amazon introduced Amazon Scout, a six-wheeled electric-powered delivery robot. The size of a small cooler on wheels, the Amazon Scout navigates along the sidewalk and brings packages from the delivery truck to the door. The device has a top hatch that automatically flips open to allow the customer to retrieve their package. Amazon has already introduced the service to customers in a neighborhood in Snohomish County, Washington.
In February 2019, Amazon said that it has invested in Aurora, a company that develops the underlying hardware and software for autonomous vehicles.
These efforts might seem to be in the early patent and prototype stages, which would put Amazon behind competitors. Companies like Uber, Tesla and Waymo have already put their autonomous vehicles through millions of miles of test drives with a safety driver behind the wheel.
But in 2019, motorists captured photos of a self-driving truck sporting the Amazon Prime logo driving down Interstate 10 in Arizona. Amazon was working with Embark, a company that builds self-driving, long-haul trucks and then partners with shipping companies.
The Embark model currently starts with a human driver, who picks up a load of goods at a warehouse, drives through local traffic onto the highway and pulls into a rest stop. The driver unhitches the trailer and an Embark driver attaches the load to an Embark truck.
The Embark employee acts as a safety driver while the self-driving truck hauls the cargo hundreds of miles to a truck stop just outside of the cargo’s destination, where the transfer back to a local driver takes place. Eventually, the goal is for the entire process to be autonomous.
Putting it all together
So, how do all of these different patents and initiatives, the e-Palette, Amazon Scout, the Embark trials, come together?
Analysts expect Amazon to use Aurora’s technology to retrofit autonomous technology to its existing fleet. Amazon also heavily invested in Rivian, a company that makes electric trucks. Amazon could use a fleet from Rivian as the foundation for its self-driving vehicles of the future.
The result would be a highly integrated and automated supply chain that features robots in the warehouse and autonomous vehicles for long-haul trucking. Autonomous vehicles would cover the last-mile delivery and bring the package those last few feet to the doorstep via a robot.
“We continue to believe the natural step for Amazon is controlling more of its own transportation and logistics, as these are almost a necessity to continue the rapid expansion of Prime and Prime Now,” said Colin Sebastian, a research analyst at Baird.
Amazon already has decent control of its own supply chain. The company is now the largest shipper in the U.S. and delivers nearly half of its own packages, according to market research company Rakuten Intelligence. But analysts like Baird’s Sebastian predict that Amazon will one day take the leap into the third-party logistics business.
“We believe Amazon will offer transportation and logistics services to third parties,” Rakuten said in a research note. “Moreover, we estimate a $400 billion plus market opportunity for Amazon in delivery, freight forwarding and contract logistics, of which even a small slice could prove material for Amazon.”
Another angle to Amazon in the autonomous vehicle market is its work to install the Alexa virtual assistant in new cars from manufacturers including BMW, Ford and Toyota. This is an infotainment play that would connect the vehicle-specific adaptation of Alexa to an app store, but as OEMs add autonomous features to their vehicles, Alexa will become the user interface for all of the functions associated with a modern vehicle cockpit.
You will tell Alexa who you are and it will automatically set the seat to your preferences, turn on your favorite music, activate child-safety locks and try to anticipate where you want to go. You can use Alexa as your interface to a variety of other functions, such as temperature settings, cruise control, real-time traffic and weather conditions and more.
As vehicles become more connected and autonomous, they will generate high volumes of data that need to be stored somewhere. Amazon wants that place to be the AWS cloud, which would enable the company to generate revenue via data analysis and deliver business insight to OEMs. That data could open up a whole new market for predictive maintenance and other types of real-time services to consumers.

Mobility experts are of the opinion that for ensuring optimal use of public transport, especially in Karnataka, the government should follow the Singapore model of hassle-free commuting and digital payment services. 
Silvester Prakasam, head of Fare System, MSI Global Private Limited of Singapore, told The New Indian Express that the Indian government should look into the variety of payment models and link the mobility transaction card with that of bank cards. “It is very difficult for people to carry multiple cards. Incase of one bank cards, there is a method to restrict the transaction limit.
In Singapore, it has been done and it has worked very well,” he said. Addressing the media in Bengaluru on Wednesday, Singapore-based mobility expert Prakasam said, “Today everyone has a smart phone. There are many phone pay app options available in the market. Indian government should be very careful while dealing with unbanked citizens and it should also cooperate with transport and banking sectors.” Prakasam is known to have spearheaded the development of integrated ticketing system in Singapore. 
He also suggested that the government use data of all commuters to address the last mile connectivity issue. Based on commuters’ travel patterns, the last mile connectivity methods should be designed, like using feeder buses everywhere is not a cost-effective method; there should be taxis, autorickshaws, bicycles, scooters and more.

  Everyone is in the race to perfect the autonomous car, developing a self-driving vehicle that is safer, smarter and more efficient. To develop and deploy autonomous cars at scale, the right technology infrastructure is critical as the production of these vehicles requires high-performance computing capacity, along with seamless cybersecurity, and the ability to manage vast data sets. The cloud offers organizations the support they need to realise their dream of building their self-driving vehicle. 
Training and testing
Autonomous cars strive to be safer than vehicles operated by humans. Delivering on this ambition requires extensive modelling and testing. The ability to collect, store, and manage data is critical, as are advanced machine learning techniques.
Toyota Research Institute (TRI) believes that accurately training autonomous cars requires trillions of miles of testing. To deliver on this, it has a fleet of test cars equipped with Light Direction and Ranging (Lidar) Sensors to record data, collecting terabytes of data every day, needing quick retrieval and analyses. TRI uses AWS to manage this data and access the processing power required to train machine learning models quickly. TRI now retrains vehicle models, increases accuracy, and introduces new features faster thanks to the cloud’s infrastructure. By following similar models, more automotive businesses will accelerate the development of safer cars.
Edging forward
Enabling autonomous cars to make rapid, data-driven decisions will make our roads safer. These machines need backing by reliable infrastructure with low latency and high availability. They also need to analyse information in real-time, including data on road conditions, weather, and the behaviour of other vehicles. Applying AI allows the car to react swiftly and safely to road conditions.
When a second of lag can make the difference between a safe or dangerous response, autonomous vehicles do not have the luxury of waiting for data processing in the cloud. Edge computing allows the analysis of critical data in the car and in real-time which reduces the cost of transmitting additional data to the cloud.
Security in the cloud
Cybersecurity is important to protect autonomous cars from hackers and malware to ensure they cannot gain access to driving controls or the data that runs through each vehicle.
It’s the job of the cloud provider to ensure cybersecurity updates and upgrades regularly happen. Additionally, the best cloud providers deliver automated security services which apply machine learning to proactively manage tasks including security assessments, threat detection, and policy management. By having security baked in, manufacturers can be confident that they have the solutions in place to detect new and emerging vulnerabilities and threats which will reduce harm to drivers and lower the risk of a breach.
Connected cars, cloud and security
Autonomous cars are our future; however, to drive adoption, manufacturers must ensure they are secure and supported by robust infrastructure. Using the right cloud vendors is critical, enabling organisations to focus their resources on building differentiated automotive experiences, rather than managing IT infrastructure.
With this in mind, AWS provides a full suite of services including Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Vehicle development and deployment. AWS’ nearly unlimited storage and compute capacity and support for deep learning frameworks such as Apache MXNet, TensorFlow and PyTorch accelerate algorithm training and testing. AWS Greengrass provides edge computing with machine learning inference capabilities for real-time processing of local rules and events in the vehicle while minimizing the cost of transmitting data to the cloud.
A combination of scalable storage and compute capacity and support for deep learning frameworks help accelerate testing and service development. At the same time, our agile platform helps businesses enables greater innovation, improve security posture and lower IT cost structure bringing us all one step closer to a reality where autonomous vehicles are the norm.

 As driverless vehicles and automated-driving technology become increasingly popular, it’s important that smart technology is considered in a holistic sense. 
The automotive industry is changing quickly, and car manufacturers anticipate the road ahead will likely lead toward an increase in driverless vehicles. Over 40 corporations are working on automated technology, with major manufacturers including Tesla, Toyota, BMW, Nissan, Ford, Audi, and GM all announcing that they’ll have driverless vehicles developed within a few years. Still, it’s hard for many people to imagine how driverless, or autonomous, vehicles will move safely and efficiently through our city streets.
As chairman and CEO of Parsons Corporation, I’m constantly thinking about how technology can positively impact infrastructure and our national defense and security, and how in turn it impacts people. As I commute home from the office, I am struck by the divergence between the state-of-the-art technology in my car and home, and a road that’s been largely the same since President Dwight Eisenhower created the interstate highway system.
It’s logical to expect that the same roads and traffic signals that were cutting-edge when we manually rolled down our windows with a crank will not be adequate to manage traffic in a connected future. We also do not have the luxury of time to conduct a series of analyses to figure this out. Cities around the world have already started testing driverless vehicles. Austin and Las Vegas are piloting low-speed automated shuttles to support local circulation in pedestrian-heavy areas, while places like Phoenix and Pittsburgh are allowing automated taxis to test their technology and business on public streets.
Smart city infrastructure will transform streets and intersections into data-sharing hubs for driverless vehicles to get a better vision of the conditions around them.
While these pilots and tests have given cities better insights into the technology, questions remain about how driverless vehicles will deliver the improved safety and increased efficiency that has been promised. The time to act is now. How will driverless vehicles interact with non-self-driving vehicles, pets, pedestrians, cyclists, scooters, and distracted drivers? Will driverless vehicles operate safely in the rain and snow? How will driverless vehicles make my commute faster and safer?
Answers to questions like these aren’t so much about the vehicles as about the streets they will drive on and their associated signals, speed limits, and other infrastructure. While driverless vehicles will have dozens of sensors, radars, and cameras that will provide a vast amount of data about objects and activities directly around them, they’ll need more information from farther away to anticipate traffic conditions throughout city streets, avoid conflicts at intersections, and anticipate human-driver actions.
This will be particularly important in the near term, when driverless vehicles will constitute a lower percentage of total vehicles on the road, minimizing the benefit of being able to share information with other driverless vehicles.
So how will the streets help driverless cars? “Smart city” infrastructure will transform streets and intersections into data-sharing hubs for driverless vehicles to get a better vision of the conditions around them. Sensors embedded in streets and mounted on streetlight poles will provide detailed traffic conditions throughout the city. Intelligent intersections will communicate with approaching driverless vehicles to identify optimal combinations of speed, fuel consumption, and routing. Vehicles and infrastructure will continuously communicate to optimize the operations of signals, streetlights, and other city resources around them.
Although cities already face the issue of too many deserving causes and not enough money, one great aspect about smart city technology is that it’s a good financial decision that pays dividends down the road, literally. Cities will be able to automate complex traffic-management tasks, allowing employees to use their time to work on higher-priority concerns.
Citizens will save time commuting to work, leaving them more refreshed and productive at the office and with more quality time with loved ones. Productivity will increase, and more importantly, so will quality of life. That will attract more businesses and people to live and work in smart cities, boosting the local economy and making the infrastructure-investment worthwhile.
You can’t pack more than 24 hours in a day—but smart-city infrastructure allows people to find extra time in their busy schedules. Cities have started to understand these needs and are advancing smart infrastructure to support driverless vehicles. Denver, Detroit, and New York City are a few of many smart cities that are installing communication devices for connected and automated vehicles.
While cars are getting smarter and more automated, the key to unlocking a driverless-vehicle future lies in smart streets and smart cities. And while the automotive industry continues to advance the vehicle technology, our cities and communities must continue to advance smart infrastructure. Driverless vehicles will not only be driven by the technology inside them, but by the infrastructure around them.

IOT and AI adoption is now being utilised to scale up contactless, affordable, and highly accessible self-drive rental services across cities.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a shift in the priorities and travel patterns of daily commuters has been observed. With safety now a top priority, commuters are expected to move away from public transportation to personal mobility options that do not require being near other commuters/drivers.
Therefore, self-driving two-wheeler rentals are uniquely positioned to address the key concerns of commuters, with a safe, reliable, and affordable service that is not shared with other commuters/drivers.
Technology (IoT) adoption within this space has served as a key enabler for operational efficiency in the past, and is now being utilised to scale up contactless, affordable, and highly accessible self-drive rental services across cities.
Transformation of self-drive two-wheeler rentals
Self-drive scooter rental is a decade-old business in India. It was primarily used in tourist hotspots such as Goa, where hotels would rent out 20-30 scooters per day to customers. However, even at a smaller scale, operators faced problems such as inability to monitor the usage of vehicles, driver behaviour, frequent theft, etc.
Today, scooter rental companies have expanded their fleets to thousands of scooters, and consumer use cases range from daily work commute and chores to food delivery, leisure activities, tourism etc. The key enabler for this rapid expansion has been widespread IoT adoption by two-wheeler fleet operators.


IoT as a key enabler for scale and adoption
A commuter’s journey on a self-drive two-wheeler rental can be broken down in 4 parts – 1) searching for available scooters 2) starting the ride 3) the ride experience, and 4) ending the ride. Each part has been optimised and streamlined using IoT.
Consumers locate available scooters on an app, and can also view features such as fuel level, presence of helmet, sanitisation status etc on the same app. Once they locate the scooter, they can start the ride within 10 seconds by scanning a QR code, which limits physical touchpoints in the overall commute. The ride experience is further optimised by real-time fuel status alerts, geo-fencing alerts, and over-speeding alerts on the app.
Finally, commuters can end the ride virtually using the app. The app also detects if the helmet has been returned to the boot, and if the boot has been locked. The consumer is then accurately charged based on this exact usage of the service.
Therefore, GPS and IoT sensors installed in scooters not only make the commute journey seamless and contactless for the consumer, but also enables the operator to constantly monitor the health of vehicle parts and send alerts to the control room in case of improper usage or theft.
Implementation of tech-enabled business model
As a function of changing priorities/commute patterns due to COVID-19, companies have utilised IoT to change their business models to enhance the safety of their services.
Many players have launched long-term rental packages for consumers, with an option of home delivery of scooters by the fleet executive (FEs). In this scenario, consumers can pick up their scooter at any point post-delivery, and then use it for months before returning.
The key enablers for the launch of this model are IoT-enabled features such as keyless transfer, virtual daily updates on vehicle health, usage during rentals, and timely servicing alerts based on predictive maintenance algorithms etc.
Customers have the flexibility to choose their scooter based on ‘last sanitised’ status now available on scooter rental apps. The app would also send alerts whenever commuters venture near red zones.


The future of IoT in self-drive two-wheeler rental industry
The IoT device is currently installed separately by operators on the scooter. But going forward, many OEMs are considering integrating into the scooter. This will transfer the responsibility of manufacturing and designing these devices to the OEM, and cut costs for the operator significantly.
Many players are also considering a switch to e-scooters to optimise their fuel costs. IoT technology on e-scooters can analyse driving patterns and impose parental controls like limiting max speed and limit.
It can also detect, and report the use of unauthorised spare parts during EV servicing. Remote-controlled delivery of an e-scooter may even be possible, with IoT-enabled cameras and a seamless 4G connection.
Scooters will soon be unlocked without the commuter having to take out his phone- automotive-grade biometric face scans, and fingerprint sensors will be installed on scooters which will ensure smooth customer experience and streamline commuter verification ability on the fleet operator end.
Technology (IOT/AI and others) has the potential to solve problems and unlock opportunities that today can only be imagined.

Traffic management systems will undergo an evolution to become Internet of Things-compliant. As engineers start to add self-driving cars and 5G networks, let’s explore the critical challenges that will arise when merging IoT systems and traffic networks. 
By  Yuvrajsinh Vaghela 
The Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconnection of devices and services that allow a free flow of data. These devices and services can be anything, ranging from home appliances like coffee makers to commercial concerns like traffic management. All you require is integrating software with a means of internet connectivity—and there you go, taking all the benefits of what IoT has to offer.
The idea behind IoT is creating a system that stores all the data on the cloud without having the need of human efforts in collecting it. It is believed that the impact of IoT on the world will be immense in the upcoming years. And, given the current trends, its effect on human life is increasing exponentially and will only continue to rise with the concept of smart cities setting in.
Smart cities rely heavily on IoT. According to Gartner, nearly 60% of all installed IoT devices were used in commercial buildings and transportation in 2017. Yes, IoT is proving highly beneficial in combatting the alarming problem of traffic congestion. Not only it can reduce costs, but also manage the traffic in a significant way by integrating IoT technology in various traffic calming elements like traffic lights and smart parking.
Though the presence of IoT offers a cutting-edge opportunity in traffic management and solutions, it comes with certain limitations that you cannot ignore. This article highlights three critical challenges that you face while integrating IoT in the traffic management system. Tackling each in turn:
1. Security Breaches
As mentioned earlier, IoT is all about interconnected devices and services, which will continue to grow exponentially. This makes it imperative for you to protect the sensitive data and networks. It’s simple: The growing number of devices accessing the central network will increase the probability of malicious attacks by the hackers. Data privacy is of supreme importance and you need to ensure that it is not vulnerable to the public at large.
An added layer of security may help to enable you to create a hack-proof traffic management solution. Ensure that all the IoT devices adhere to your security policies. Other considerations to take into account are data transmission encryption, user access control, and device authentication.

2. High-Tech Network Infrastructure
Remember, all of these high-tech solutions will need high-speed data transfer techniques, as the proliferation of IoT devices will make it necessary for you to work with larger data capacity. Not only this, but you will also need to manage more IP addresses—in short, increasing the workload of IT teams. This means you need a really good network infrastructure in place.
It is best to come up with the network facilities that are able to handle constant communication, as well as the collection of data from the sensors and other IoT devices. As and when the automated workflows and controls will be added to each program, the IoT solutions’ data outputs will also grow simultaneously. So, it is important to have strong networks that have the potential to easily fit into the IoT needs as and when they evolve.
3. Increased investments
Yes, it is totally true that the adoption of IoT technology will reduce costs and lead to operational optimizations. But, on the other hand, it is also true that integrating it will require a significant investment. You will have to incur expenses associated with network infrastructure, retrofitting vehicles or machines to be directly connected to an IoT device, implementation downtime, configuration, customization, training, and security, as well as the cost to plan, implement, and manage the IoT system.
The success of IoT technology in traffic management—or any industry, for that matter—largely depends on the ability to successfully examine, collect, and mine the data, as well as to gather insights from a constantly evolving set of IoT devices. Well, there are many cloud-based solutions that can be used to track IoT assets and further report on their basic features. However, there are fewer solutions that aid in managing and optimizing a significant cost element in the application of IoT technology.
Overcoming the challenges is the key to IoT’s success in traffic management. 
Traffic is definitely a crucial aspect that showcases a city’s efficiency status and livability factor. There are many other limitations that will come to light as IoT increases its potentialities in traffic management.
But, for now, the cities that are planning to integrate IoT in their traffic management systems will have to prevail over basic infrastructure problems. These can be anything from road planning and zoning to construction-related issues. Not solving them will create complexities in implementing IoT technology. So, diverting your efforts toward solving these issues should be your first step in overcoming the IoT challenges.
You can go on to the next level of integrating high-tech solutions, like providing the city with great internet connectivity, as if for any reason connectivity is hampered, the entire smart city could fall apart. Hence, for IoT, it is very crucial to have a high-speed data transfer system in place.
Once smart cities evolve with the aforementioned changes, IoT is sure to play a key role in the development and integration of traffic management as a whole.

 Automobile segment has not seen much innovation in last century after Ford, but this decade would cover up all that shortfall.
By  Deepak Singhal 
So far, cloud computing has been a buzzword for most of the emerging technology trends, across sectors. Internet of Things (IoT) and the surge in connected devices leading to smart homes, smart cities, and AI powered innovations, is all said to be driven by Cloud. The same now holds true for the Automobile Technology segment. 
Automobile segment has not seen much innovation in last century after Ford; but this decade would cover up all that shortfall.  From building stronger, higher capacity engines to now changing focus on creating smarter cars, EVM and even AI powered driverless cars, the segment has been now innovating in real sense, and adopting the best in the emerging technology, at a fast pace. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is a term used for group of technologies powering innovation that is set to transform not only the automobile segment but the very concept of smart travel!
What is V2X or Connected Vehicles?
Simply put, Vehicle-to-everything or V2X is an integrated communication system that allows a smart automobile to be connected to its environment, always. All the communication cannot go via Cloud always because of possible high latency and un-availability of internet. 
 Advent of 5G will reduce this problem to great extent. These are also known as Connected Vehicles and typically comprise of automobiles with Interactive Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS’s) and Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) and are designed to enhance ‘situation awareness’ and to identify and avoid traffic accidents.
In other words, Connected Vehicles deploy intelligent communication that can be useful to solve traffic woes, enhance road safety, and offer seamless in-transit infotainment, advanced parking assistance and roadside assistance. It is also useful for remote diagnostics, and telematics for autonomous self-driving vehicles, and global positioning systems (GPS).
Largely, connected vehicles comprise of Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-Network (V2N), Vehicle -to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle – to- Pedestrian (V2P), Vehicle –to- device (V2D), and Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) connectivity. The DSCR – a WLAN based V2X communication, is the simplest form of connected vehicle network, and is useful to ensure efficient V2V and V2I communication in remote areas. The 3GPP or Cellular V2X, utilises the cellular data connectivity and communication network that offers an advanced, more sophisticated, two-way communication for V2I, V2V, V2D and V2N interactions.
Although nascent right now, the V2X is globally emerging as one of the smartest technology applications that efficiently combines AI, Data Analytics, smart Infrastructure and IoT, with the best in automobile technology. As per a report by Stratistics MRC, the Global Automotive V2X Market was estimated to be USD 341.22 million as of 2018 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 42.1% over the next decade, to reach USD 8060.79 million, by 2028.
 Factors like rising traffic congestion, need to curtail environmental hazards due to emission, need for intelligent navigation and smart transportation facilities powered by access to 5G connectivity, and road safety are some of the key motivators for the growth of the V2X market.
Role of Cloud in the Connected Vehicle Ecosystem:
One of the key features of connected vehicles is the two way communication that translates into a lot of data, exchanged consistently over a seamless network. Connected vehicles not only share information about themselves but also capture lots of sensory information from its surroundings, especially data generated by cameras, and radars, all of which needs to be adequately aggregated, analysed, and shared in real-time to maintain a consistent V2X dynamics. If done singularly or in a disconnected method, it can reduce the efficiency of the network and render the entire technology redundant.
This can be avoided by employing Cloud connectivity, to ensure the data collected is not only effectively stored and utilised but can also be a game changer in designing future technology innovations. Using intelligent insights into the geographical, environmental and consumer usage patterns, over a long period of time, Automotive V2X communication systems connected to cloud can fuel the future innovations in automobile technology.
It also helps deal with cyber-security concerns, while helping automotive manufacturers a real time information feed on varied parameters of vehicle performance, so as to assist efficient technology development.
Apart from these, the cloud-connected V2X has been instrumental in:
1.       The development of ‘software-defined’ vehicles, where ‘isolated automobiles’ are now converted into hyper connected and constantly communicating network of smart transportation
2.       Helping automobile manufacturers to effectively leverage the infinite scalability of the Internet and the potential of IoT to deliver progressive, next gen features to connected vehicles, and
3.       Transforming the autonomous vehicle (AV) value chain, using data driven insights to enhance user experience, safety, and efficiency of connected vehicles and thereby transform the technology space for innovative mobility solutions.
4.       Sending peta bytes of data generated by vehicles to Cloud. This helps us to build complex machine learning models on cloud using this humongous data and then deploy models on Edge inside car. Hence, all heavy loading is done by cloud and models deployed on Edge inside car can take spontaneous decisions.
While the above factors paint a convincing picture, the cloud connectivity and V2X communications technology is yet to address challenges around integrated data collections, seamless network support, and access to high end connectivity bandwidth across terrains. Despite this, however, it would be true to state that the future of smart automotive technology is a dynamic and innovative phase of growth, where the car-to-cloud connectivity is set to redefine the idea of smart mobility, while making road transport in urban and rural areas more safe, energy efficient and effective.

Columbus, Ohio, the winner of the Transportation Department’s 2016 Smart City Challenge, unveiled three Smart Columbus projects that will pilot new mobility technology: smart mobility hubs, connected vehicles and the re-commissioned Linden LEAP.
“Columbus won the Smart City Challenge because we had the vision and ambition to try new mobility technologies in a neighborhood to address the daily challenges residents face,” Mayor Andrew Ginther said in the July 28 announcement. “Today, that vision comes to life. These mobility pilots in Linden will bring food to neighbors in need, connect residents to reliable and affordable mobility options, and help vehicles travel through the neighborhood more safely.”
Smart mobility hubs have been created to aggregate multi-modal first mile/last mile solutions at accessible locations to make traveling easier and more affordable. At the center of each hub is an IKE Smart City interactive digital kiosk that provides free Wi-Fi and access to Pivot, Central Ohio’s multi-modal trip planning application that integrates end-to-end trip planning, booking, electronic ticketing and payment services across public and private modes of transportation. Six hubs are now open.
To improve the performance of connected vehicle infrastructure, the Smart Columbus program is calling for 500 community volunteers to install connected vehicle technology in their personal vehicles to provide real-time safety alerts in the city’s connected vehicle environment and collect non-personally-identifiable data to serve as a secure resource for other interested smart cities and entrepreneurs.
On-board units will allow vehicles to exchange data and receive in-car alerts like blind spot detection or rear end collision warning. The units also allow vehicles to communicate with traffic signals and other roadway infrastructure to provide in-car alerts that give drivers advanced warning of potential hazards or safety concerns ahead. Traffic managers will be able to adjust signal timing to prioritize connected buses and emergency vehicles, and they can mobilize other responses like snow and salt trucks based on real-time information on road conditions relayed by the roadway units.
Private vehicles will be matched by 500-750 public vehicles that will include vehicles from city and county fleets, fire and police department, public transit and freight trucks.
The Linden LEAP, an all-electric self-driving shuttle dedicated to providing first-mile, last-mile mobility challenge in Columbus’ Linden neighborhood, is being recommissioned to transport pre-packaged food boxes to residents experiencing food insecurity.
The pilots will run through March 2021, with reporting published to the U.S. Transportation Department and to the Smart Columbus website in May 2021. Data captured by the pilots will be ingested into the Smart Columbus Operating System to inform future Smart City work locally and beyond, officials said, but it will be free of personally identifiable information.
The Smart Columbus Operating System is an open, dynamic data platform that serves as the backbone to smart city projects and can support machine learning and predictive models to drive better trip optimization.
AI-powered traffic management
Tennessee is adding artificial intelligence to the 28-mile-long I-24 Smart Corridor between Nashville and Murfreesboro. In June, the Federal Highway Administration awarded a $2.6 million grant to the Tennessee Department of Transportation for its Artificial Intelligence-Powered Decision Support Tools for Integrated Corridor Management project, which aims to increase travel time reliability and optimize traffic patterns.
Vanderbilt University, a partner in the project, is developing the DSS tools to coordinate ramp meters (traffic lights before entering a highway), and highway traffic signals and set dynamic speed limits that facilitate less overall traffic. DSS will address traffic incidents and by delivering appropriate lane guidance to drivers near the accident to mitigate secondary collisions. The system will pull data from radar, CCTV and Bluetooth readers along I-24.
Information highway
Arizona is considering running high-capacity fiber-optic cable along I-19 in Southern Arizona and along I-17 and I-40, the state Department of Transportation announced in a request for information. Besides providing communications infrastructure for overhead message boards, traffic cameras, weather stations and wrong-way driving detection technology, the project would also enable development of connected and automated vehicles. Additionally, the project would create more affordable opportunities for wired and wireless broadband connectivity in rural communities near the highways.
Drivers in Phoenix, meanwhile, can now tap into an interactive dashboard created by the City of Phoenix Street Transportation Department the shows the real-time status of roadway maintenance projects, including filling potholes, repaving areas and crack sealing, filterable by district area, status type and project type.

With global warming and environment becoming major concerns, governments across the world are putting increased thrust on the need for phasing out petrol/diesel vehicles. While electric vehicles (EVs) have been in the pipeline for decades, it is only now that these are emerging as a viable alternative to petrol/diesel vehicles.
 Support from governments backed by ambitious targets as well as evolution of battery technology has enabled this shift. In China, 1.1 million electric cars were sold in 2018—more than half the total world sales.
With the ambitious target of shifting a bulk of its vehicles to electric fleet by 2030, India has launched policy measures and incentives to promote electric and hybrid cars. Earlier this year, the government announced `10,000 crore in outlay for the second phase of the FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles) scheme to be invested towards developing charging infrastructure.
Major manufacturers across the world are now investing in electric and related technologies. Ford plans to have 13 EV models by 2020 at an investment of $4.5 billion. Tesla plans to build 1 million EVs by 2020. In India, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors have already launched electric cars, and Maruti Suzuki is fleet testing its first electric car. However, lack of infrastructure is a major concern.
At the same time, while electric cars are clean, they do not solve the problem of congestion and remain outside the economic reach of a large section of population. Electric bicycles, on the other hand, offer both an affordable and a sustainable mobility solution; they can also address traffic woes. And then there is no range anxiety—if one loses battery charge, she can always pedal back easy with gear shifts.
India largely runs on two-wheelers, with about one-third of households owning one. In comparison, just 11% households own a car. E-bikes are also a rapidly emerging global trend—these essentially are an evolved version of bicycles, fitted with an electric motor to enable motorised pedalling along with manual pedalling. Given that two-wheelers account for as much as 75% of vehicular pollution in India, e-bikes can be an eco-friendly alternative to conventional two-wheelers. For this, the government must initiate policies for those people who currently use bicycles and are planning to upgrade to motorcycles or conventional scooters.
According to a report by Persistence Market Research, the global e-bike market is projected to register a CAGR of 4.7% during the 2017-22 period. Here again, China is leading. Also, in Europe, government subsidies and favourable policies are ushering in an impressive growth in e-bikes—France registered 90%-plus growth in the sales of e-bikes in recent years, thanks to a government subsidy on its purchase.
E-scooters are also an attractive option for people who struggle with last-mile transport connectivity issues. California-based start-ups Bird and Lime pioneered an interesting concept of shareable dockless e-scooters, and the success of the idea propelled these start-ups to spread to more than 100 cities. People struggling with traffic congestion, those needing short but costly taxi rides from public transport to work/home, or those walking to work/home have found e-scooters flexible, affordable and enjoyable to use. While this concept is yet to find ground in India, the need for flexible, last-mile transport solutions makes this a prospect.
The Economic Survey 2019 points out the limited availability of charging infrastructure coupled with lack of fast-charging facilities are major impediments to increased adoption of EVs in India. The project to make EVs a functioning reality of Indian roads needs the creation a massive infrastructure of charging stations across cities, residential buildings, parking spots, and community spaces.
While e-bikes have caught the attention of a small group of health-conscious and tech-savvy Indians, the absence of safe biking infrastructure hampers its growth in India. It must be underlined that countries which have provided government support—in the form of subsidy or infrastructure building—and imposed implementation of strict environmental rules have witnessed the steepest growth rates in e-bikes. India not only needs to encourage people to turn to e-bikes through subsidies and incentives, but also build safe cycling lanes across cities.

When Mike Sewell, a civil engineer with Gresham Smith, designed the urban bike network along Sixth Street in 2015, he wanted to connect downtown to more residential areas and encourage more people to bicycle on their commute. As a bike commuter, he said he considered himself “a purist” when Bird scooters first showed up in Louisville in August 2018.
Bike lanes, as their name denoted, should be for bikes, he thought.
Not anymore.
Sewell warmed to the idea of scooters as a form of green mobility after realizing that not everyone can take up the sometimes-sweaty endeavor of cycling to work in a suit.
“For people who are completely car-dependent, it’s a good tweak in the right direction for opening their eyes,” he said.
Since the first electric scooters arrived in Louisville in August 2018, people have taken more than 400,000 rides on Birds and Limes and now Spins, Jumps, HOPRs, Lyfts and Bolts. As tourists and residents alike continue to use them recreationally, cities such as Louisville are also considering how e-scooters could take cars off the road and make public transportation more attractive. At the same time, some urban planners and urbanists wonder if the scooter start-ups really offer a new way to commute or if they are anything more than the latest tech craze.
And, at a time of increased pressure to address climate change, questions are arising about whether these seemingly eco-friendly vehicles are really all that green. On top of that, city officials and planners have to keep public safety on their minds.
Porter Stevens, urban planner and LEO contributor, said he sees great promise in them as urban planning tools. “I hope that appropriate regulation can catch up,” he said, “and they can become another piece of the transportation network for the city.”
A New Way to Commute?
As an avid cyclist, Sewell hasn’t switched over to a scooter commute, and likely won’t. Still, he is far more excited about pedaling past a Bird or a Lime on his daily ride than he was last year. He even thinks bike lanes should be renamed — “light vehicle lanes.” And, yes, that includes scooters but also any other under-15 mph, micro-mobility option that’s yet to hit it big.
“Just like we want to share the space with cars, we should be open to sharing our space with other similar type vehicles,” he said.
Sewell said he believes that, despite the general impressions of e-scooters being used largely for recreation, people really are using them to commute. Observing the data, which he receives as a collaborator with Metro Louisville, a slightly more location-specific version of what Louisville publishes in the open data portal, he noticed that e-scooters are a popular way for West End residents to commute into the Central Business District. 
The numbers seem to bear that out.
The median distance of all scooter trips between August 2018 and July 2019 was .66 miles and the average was 1.19 miles, according to city data.
But can electric scooters really draw people out of their personal vehicles?
Stevens thinks they have the potential to do so, but getting there might not be easy. “The same barriers that face the people who commute by bicycle face scooters as well because so many of Louisville’s streets are completely designed to favor cars over any other type of transportation mode.”
Not all urban planners believe these rides will cut down car use and become a tool for future city design.
Matthew Ruther, assistant professor of urban affairs at the UofL, questioned if the two-wheeled transports are being used as way to commute, or just as a fun pastime for residents and particularly, tourists.
“My personal opinion is that they are a fad,” he said.
He suspects that, in Louisville, many of the rides may have just been alternatives to walking, based on the short distances accumulated in Louisville data.
That was the case for Jeff, who did not want to give his full last name.
Tales of the city
Jeff was visiting from Philadelphia and in town for business meetings. After indulging in a hot brown and walking 20 minutes, he wanted to experience more Louisville landmarks; a Bolt scooter was the answer.
“When you’re new to an area, you really get to take in the sights at your own pace, it’s fun, it’s exciting, and when it’s hot, you get a nice breeze going,” he said.
He was still relying on a rental car to get around Louisville, and the scooter was just for recreation.
Patrick Carrico, a Highlands resident, was working downtown when he looked at his watch and realized he was late for a doctor’s appointment. His doctor’s office, located about three blocks away, typically would have been walkable, but on a time crunch, the Bird e-scooter sitting conveniently in front of his office seemed like an easy solution. “I opened up the app, scanned the barcode and soon, through a couple of green lights, I stopped in front of the doctor’s office right on time,” he said.
Ruther said that, thinking about how the city’s first-ring suburbs connect to downtown, Louisville is less dense than many places. “I would suspect that individuals here would have more trouble getting some places.”
THE LAST MILE
Beyond city center commutes, the short average distances also position e-scooters to be a solution to a core issue for urban planners: the last mile problem.
The last mile refers to that final stretch of a commute from a transportation center such as a bus stop to the final destination.
“It’s definitely a problem in Louisville,” said Jeff O’Brien, director of Develop Louisville, a future-focused metro department connected to the Office of Advanced Planning. “We look at our bus routes, a lot of times they end in parts of the community where we don’t have a good sidewalk network.” He thought e-scooters and other micromobility options could bridge that gap.
Similarly, Sewell said that, based on the location data he sees, people are hitching e-scooter rides to get to popular TARC transfer stations. Unfortunately, scooter riders can’t carry e-scooters onto buses, but TARC’s app follows a platform where users can plan their route connecting bus lines with electric scooters as well as Uber/Lyft and LouVelo bikeshare.
City plans
Scooters conveniently fit into a multimodal transportation plan the Office of Advanced Planning developed in 2016: Move Louisville.
The ambitious transit plan considered how bikes in collaboration with expanded public transit could shift how frequently Louisvillians use cars. According to its research, 82% of Louisville commuters drive to work alone.
The 2016 document was published in the early days of shared scooters, when Bird was probably still pitching to venture capital firms, but, according to O’Brien, electric scooters fit perfectly alongside the goals they set out for the LouVelo bikeshare program.
“We didn’t anticipate that e-scooters were going to show up on our street, but we have a goal that says embrace smart mobility, and we knew that the sharing economy was growing,” he said. Even if urban planners question the readiness of Louisville’s roadways to handle e-scooters, Louisville has been establishing the framework to invite more scooter companies.







In July, the city dockless vehicle policy was revised to allow for eight operators at a time rather than four and to lower the standards for companies to increase and decrease the sizes of their fleets.
A probationary license allows a company to have up to 650 vehicles; whereas a full operational license allows up to 1,050. Louisville regulations prohibit start-ups from sizing up their scooter armies too fast. A company can only add 100 new scooters to its fleet per month in its probationary period and 200 with a full license, and that’s if it is already averaging three rides per day per vehicle. If it drops below an average of two rides per day, Metro will determine how many vehicles it has to remove.
SCOOTER BACKLASH
Not everyone likes these e-vehicles.
LEO reported Nov. 20 that vandalism of e-scooters has been occurring, including the cutting of brake lines. One was thrown into the Ohio River.
Scooter vandalism isn’t uncommon. When they first launched in Los Angeles, annoyed citizens chucked them into the ocean, set them on fire or hung bags of dog poop on their handles. One Instagram, @birdgraveyard, is dedicated to showing all the ways e-scooters have met their match.
Some frustrations are due to the almost constant presence of them on city sidewalks, either zooming past pedestrians or parked.
“It’s a little strange to me that you have private companies that are almost co-opting public space,” Ruther said. He has seen them parked in the middle of sidewalks and even blocking disability ramps.
Carrico, the rider who took a bird to his doctor’s office, uses scooters sparingly, partly because he doesn’t feel entirely safe traveling longer distances on them. He agreed that riders should wear helmets, but said it’s unrealistic to expect them to always have one on hand. He also found them difficult to navigate in areas without bike lanes. “They’re not safe on sidewalks, but I feel exposed on the roadway,” he said.
Some urban planners think developing infrastructure to safely accommodate e-scooters on Louisville streets could encourage more people to use them to get around, but for now, safety still seems to be the biggest scooters‘ biggest source of controversy.
“We can have all the kind of vehicle options for people to use in the world, but if they don’t feel safe using them on streets, then they probably won’t move the needle that much,” Stevens said.
In August, Louisville set speed restrictions and no-ride and no-parking zones in some areas. With geofencing technology, e-scooters automatically slow to 10 mph in the Central Business District, Waterfront Park, UofL, the KFC Yum Center pavilion and the Mid City Mall. They stop working entirely near the Kentucky School for the Blind and American Printing House for the Blind, the downtown skatepark and the Kentucky Exposition Center, which also are no parking zones. The Big Four Bridge is intended to be a no-ride zone, but e-scooter companies have managed to only slow them in that area, a city official said.
At the request of Councilman Brandon Coan, the city is working on addressing the issue of e-scooter parking with a pilot parking program in The Highlands. Metro government has identified nine spots where riders normally leave their e-scooters and where the city could paint parking zones onto public rights of way away from the road.
The city now bans e-scooter use from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., because most accidents in other cities that Louisville researched occurred after dark. (So far, no one has died while riding an e-scooter in Louisville, although it has happened in other areas, including Lexington, Kentucky). Metro government may move up the nighttime ban to an earlier time as the sun begins to set earlier.
To operate in Louisville, there’s a price tag. According to the city’s dockless vehicle policy, the probationary license costs $2,000, and a full-operating license is another $1,000. Then, the start-ups must pay $50 a year and $1 per day for each used, deployed scooter. Group parking zones cost $100 per area, and on top of that companies must pay $10,000 for a performance bond. The policy says these funds support the expansion of the city’s shared mobility infrastructure.
As Green as they Seem?
What has often been touted as the biggest selling point of e-scooters is its sustainability. But some studies indicate that, while greener than cars, they may not be the most sustainable option.
First, Alison Griswold, a reporter for Quartz on the sharing economy, crunched Louisville numbers on Bird scooters using their vehicle ID — a feature that has since been removed from Louisville’s open data portal. What she found was the scooters had an average lifespan of 28.8 days on city streets. A Bird representative suggested that the scooters may have been moved away from Louisville but did not elaborate as to where.
Louisville data officer, Michael Schnuerle didn’t think the Quartz analysis painted an accurate picture. He said the vehicle ID is an unreliable data point because it isn’t consistently tied to one scooter. Still, he wasn’t exactly sure how scooter companies assign vehicle IDs.
With a range of about 25 miles, these scooters also have to regularly be charged, and getting them to the private garages turned charging hubs adds to their lifetime emissions. Typically, gas-powered vehicles are picking them up: commuting to collect the scooters, returning home and setting them back up in a specific location by 7 a.m.
A study from North Carolina State University found that the driving distances for picking up scooters can impact their life cycle CO2 emissions by 27% positively or negatively, depending on how far – or short – cars travel to retrieve them. In addition to considering the charging infrastructure, NCSU researchers also factored in emissions from building and shipping the scooters from China. The study suggested that every mile a passenger rides on a scooter emits an average of 202 grams of CO2, 43% of that impact coming from collection and distribution. The Raleigh-based researchers said that’s about half of what cars emit but significantly more than biking and walking.
Russell Murphy, communications manager for Lime thought it was still too soon for studies to effectively weigh the sustainability of scooters “This is a very young industry and rapidly changing,” he said. “We’re moving in a direction that not only makes our scooters more sustainable, but we’re working with cities so there’s more uptick on micromobility replacing car trips.”
According to Lime data, one out of three scooter trips replaces a car trip. Additionally, Lime and Bird each invest in renewable energy to offset emissions associated with their fleet, including pick-up.
Bike it
Micromobility advocates also point out that scooters represent only one type of shared car-alternatives. Historically, the most popular programs have been docked biking systems. 36.5 million rides were taken on U.S. station-based bikes in 2018 according to the National Association of City Transportation Officials, or NACTO. Louisville’s LouVelo was introduced in 2017, but its scope is limited to around downtown and UofL’s campus.
NACTO also reported that while docked bikeshares had been the stalwarts of the shared transport economy, dockless electric scooters have surpassed station-based bikeshares, with 38.5 million trips in 2018.
Sometimes, it’s just a matter of exercise. Sharon Barrett who was visiting Louisville from Murfreesboro, Tennessee said she didn’t want to take a scooter because its electric boost meant putting in less physical effort. “We rent bikes wherever we go … It’s a good way to see the city,” she said.
Scooters for the people
While in some cities, e-scooters have gotten a reputation as the preferred transit of the tech-bro crowd, most companies have established accessibility programs to appeal to people with limited transportation options. Available for anyone who qualifies for government assistance programs, One Bird, Lime Access and Bolt Forward cut scooter rental prices in half and establish locations where users can pay with cash rather than a card and use phones that aren’t smartphones.
“This technology and transportation is something everyone should have access to,” Phil Jones, senior director of government relations for Lime, said. “The more we break down these barriers for everyone to use micromobility, the better off our cities will be, the better off our community will be, the better off our citizens will be.”
Louisville data officer Schnuerle commended the companies’ accessibility programs, but noted that the current placement of the scooters could be more diverse. He said that there is a high usage in West Louisville, and that there could be even higher numbers if scooters were consistently deployed in those areas.
Louisville’s dockless vehicle policy does mandate that a minimum number of scooters must be placed in certain areas, but only when companies’ fleets number at least 250.
“There’s kind of a bias because the companies are placing them right now where they believe the most activity would occur.”
Still, Schnuerle doesn’t think electric scooters, whether shared or personally owned, will go away, and cities will have to keep up.
“People are looking for alternatives to cars. They’re looking for some way to get around where they don’t have to pay for a car, gas and insurance and parking,” he said. “For me, I would think it’s important for the safety of riders to have an infrastructure in place.” •

Automobile segment has not seen much innovation in last century after Ford, but this decade would cover up all that shortfall.
So far, cloud computing has been a buzzword for most of the emerging technology trends, across sectors. Internet of Things (IoT) and the surge in connected devices leading to smart homes, smart cities, and AI powered innovations, is all said to be driven by Cloud. The same now holds true for the Automobile Technology segment. 
Automobile segment has not seen much innovation in last century after Ford; but this decade would cover up all that shortfall.  From building stronger, higher capacity engines to now changing focus on creating smarter cars, EVM and even AI powered driverless cars, the segment has been now innovating in real sense, and adopting the best in the emerging technology, at a fast pace. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is a term used for group of technologies powering innovation that is set to transform not only the automobile segment but the very concept of smart travel!
What is V2X or Connected Vehicles?
Simply put, Vehicle-to-everything or V2X is an integrated communication system that allows a smart automobile to be connected to its environment, always. All the communication cannot go via Cloud always because of possible high latency and un-availability of internet. 
 Advent of 5G will reduce this problem to great extent. These are also known as Connected Vehicles and typically comprise of automobiles with Interactive Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS’s) and Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) and are designed to enhance ‘situation awareness’ and to identify and avoid traffic accidents. In other words, Connected Vehicles deploy intelligent communication that can be useful to solve traffic woes, enhance road safety, and offer seamless in-transit infotainment, advanced parking assistance and roadside assistance. It is also useful for remote diagnostics, and telematics for autonomous self-driving vehicles, and global positioning systems (GPS).
Largely, connected vehicles comprise of Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-Network (V2N), Vehicle -to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle – to- Pedestrian (V2P), Vehicle –to- device (V2D), and Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) connectivity. The DSCR – a WLAN based V2X communication, is the simplest form of connected vehicle network, and is useful to ensure efficient V2V and V2I communication in remote areas. The 3GPP or Cellular V2X, utilises the cellular data connectivity and communication network that offers an advanced, more sophisticated, two-way communication for V2I, V2V, V2D and V2N interactions.
Although nascent right now, the V2X is globally emerging as one of the smartest technology applications that efficiently combines AI, Data Analytics, smart Infrastructure and IoT, with the best in automobile technology. As per a report by Stratistics MRC, the Global Automotive V2X Market was estimated to be USD 341.22 million as of 2018 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 42.1% over the next decade, to reach USD 8060.79 million, by 2028. Factors like rising traffic congestion, need to curtail environmental hazards due to emission, need for intelligent navigation and smart transportation facilities powered by access to 5G connectivity, and road safety are some of the key motivators for the growth of the V2X market.
Role of Cloud in the Connected Vehicle Ecosystem:
One of the key features of connected vehicles is the two way communication that translates into a lot of data, exchanged consistently over a seamless network. Connected vehicles not only share information about themselves but also capture lots of sensory information from its surroundings, especially data generated by cameras, and radars, all of which needs to be adequately aggregated, analysed, and shared in real-time to maintain a consistent V2X dynamics. If done singularly or in a disconnected method, it can reduce the efficiency of the network and render the entire technology redundant.
This can be avoided by employing Cloud connectivity, to ensure the data collected is not only effectively stored and utilised but can also be a game changer in designing future technology innovations. Using intelligent insights into the geographical, environmental and consumer usage patterns, over a long period of time, Automotive V2X communication systems connected to cloud can fuel the future innovations in automobile technology. It also helps deal with cyber-security concerns, while helping automotive manufacturers a real time information feed on varied parameters of vehicle performance, so as to assist efficient technology development.
Apart from these, the cloud-connected V2X has been instrumental in:
1.       The development of ‘software-defined’ vehicles, where ‘isolated automobiles’ are now converted into hyper connected and constantly communicating network of smart transportation
2.       Helping automobile manufacturers to effectively leverage the infinite scalability of the Internet and the potential of IoT to deliver progressive, next gen features to connected vehicles, and
3.       Transforming the autonomous vehicle (AV) value chain, using data driven insights to enhance user experience, safety, and efficiency of connected vehicles and thereby transform the technology space for innovative mobility solutions.
4.       Sending peta bytes of data generated by vehicles to Cloud. This helps us to build complex machine learning models on cloud using this humongous data and then deploy models on Edge inside car. Hence, all heavy loading is done by cloud and models deployed on Edge inside car can take spontaneous decisions.
While the above factors paint a convincing picture, the cloud connectivity and V2X communications technology is yet to address challenges around integrated data collections, seamless network support, and access to high end connectivity bandwidth across terrains. Despite this, however, it would be true to state that the future of smart automotive technology is a dynamic and innovative phase of growth, where the car-to-cloud connectivity is set to redefine the idea of smart mobility, while making road transport in urban and rural areas more safe, energy efficient and effective.

The Covid-19 pandemic has laid bare a number of reckonings for our urban spaces and how we interact with them. A notably striking one has been with our carbon footprint. Global lockdowns in movement correlated with the single largest drop in carbon emissions since World War II—and reopening has seen a return to “business as usual” so fast that even climate scientists are startled. Now, cities worldwide are wondering how they can lock in the environmental gains made during the pandemic before they disappear.
So it appears more timely than ever to ask this question of Rio. How can the Cidade Maravilhosa—a city that has held a statured role in the sustainability debate, home to the first-ever global conference on the topic—craft a low-carbon future? Specifically, let’s focus on the transportation sector, which is now one of the largest contributors of CO2 emissions globally (and steadily increasing). In the end, it was the drop in mobility, namely from air, freight and automobile travel, that led cities to see the cleanest air in a generation.
Using the backcasting approach to scenario analysis—where we project a future scenario and work back through the steps necessary to attain that scenario—this article will frame alternative futures for Rio, sustainable and unsustainable, examining both the key drivers of change and the uncertainties affecting transport here over the next 30 years. Ultimately, it will propose a future vision for low-carbon transport in the city by 2050 and discuss the potential policy routes available to achieve those goals.
Definitions and Considerations
According the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) definition, “sustainable” refers to a stabilization of the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere at 450 parts per million (ppm), or lower than 1,000 Gigagram (Gg) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). Given relatively stable trends, let us assume that the city’s population grows from around 6.5 million in 2020 to approximately 7 million by 2050. According to the United Nations, Rio’s metropolitan region will climb faster, from 13 million in 2020 to 14 million in 2030, and perhaps to over 16 million by 2050—holding significant implications for transport. 
Rio’s transport here is defined as all transport generated by the city’s residents, including journeys made both domestically and internationally, and freight transport. Nearly half of Brazil’s carbon emissions are caused by land use, which, after years of decline, are poised to rise due to increased deforestation. But in Rio, energy consumption made up 79% of the 20.56 million tons of carbon released into the atmosphere in 2017; of that, transport contributes nearly 36%, or 7,371 Gg of CO2e. “On road” traffic makes up about three-quarters of transport emissions, with aviation contributing around a quarter. Therefore, reducing passenger transport emissions is critical.
Using forecasts deployed by Jonas Åkerman and Mattias Höjer, our analysis acknowledges technology’s potential in reducing vehicular fuel intensity 35-80% by 2050, 40% in aviation, and 20-60% for freight. We have to distinguish also between the travel needed to reach a desired destination (derived), and the travel necessary to complete certain functions, like employment or groceries (structurally enforced). The latter is, of course, more difficult to change, but is by far the most significant: in Rio’s favelas, 49% of all trips are taken for work, 39% for study. In order to shape this travel, one has to look at geographic and functional accessibility, or the distances of the trips made; in Rio, the average trip to work is 17.74km, which takes about 52 minutes. The private car owner travels the farthest (22.1 km), and almost the longest (51 minutes), second only to bus riders (63 minutes). The highest potential for fuel efficiency is projected for short-distance car travel, but with growth expected in population and automobile sales (which we’ll get to below), it can be concluded that technology alone will not guarantee sustainability.
It is also worth providing context for transport in Latin America. In Rio, the automobile is the mode used for only 22% of transportation that occurs in the city. Yet Rio’s built form is still heavily car-centric, clustered around major urban highways, hillside-bored tunnels, and trafficked thoroughfares. Bus journeys, which make up 37% of modal share, can be arduous or unsafe; walking journeys, a quarter of trips made, involve crossing dangerous roads with little sidewalk space. As Brazilian transport planner Eduardo Alcântara Vasconcellos explains, for years, resources were predominantly dedicated to a car-driving minority rather than to public transport users. This is due to a range of historic factors in Latin America, he writes, including lack of political representation, scarcity of data, centralized power, economic constraints, and conservative transportation planning. As a result, services once available locally are now located farther apart, most conveniently accessed by car.
Transportation and Urban Inequality
Urban transport in Rio entails underlying issues of equity that may not exist to the same extent in a Western context. This distinction is crucial in whatever planning or policy prescriptions are made going forward. Under the technocratic administration of Mayor Eduardo Paes, the city marketed itself as addressing these inequities through several major transportation investments, including the introduction of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) network; an expansion of the cycling and cycle-hire network; new light rail services; and a fourth subway line with larger cars. However, commute times actually increased, the increase in modes being more of a marketing ploy than assurance of access (since numerous bus lines were cut, including direct access from lower-income areas to higher-income areas of the city). 
The investments appeared to pay off in ridership: in 2010, the city had 2.3 million bus riders, 588,000 metro riders, and 499,000 tram riders; in 2018, there were 2.9 million, 661,000, and 598,000, respectively. However, it is unclear how much of this is an increase in individuals, since rather than taking a direct bus now multiple modes are required (hence why commute times increased).
The city’s 450 km of cycle lanes accumulated over the years (up from two in 1990), are an improvement, though the patchwork nature of those paths leads to significant gaps that cause many injuries and fatalities. For decades Avenida Atlântica and four other important roads are closed to car traffic on Sundays. Micro-mobility devices, like scooters, are now being deployed by private companies with city regulation. Today, in yet another generation of marketing ploys, conservative mayor Marcelo Crivella has pledged “fossil-fuel-free streets” with electric buses by 2030 and other traffic calming measures—but as with other pledges of his first administration, now coming to an end, little has been done, kicking responsibility once again to the next administration.
While the city’s overall transport emissions declined from 8.7 million tons in 2012 to 7.3 million in 2017, this may be due primarily to economic recession. Furthermore, the city government said that “the growth in the number of private cars” was a key driver behind a spike in overall energy consumption, without a major population change, from 8.7 million tons in 2005 to 17.9 million tons in 2012. Car ownership has grown from 1.3 million automobiles in 2001 to 2.2 million in 2019, encouraged by a burgeoning middle class and relatively low gasoline costs, according to the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Although still less than 1% of modal share, ownership of two-wheel mopeds is growing even faster, from 75,755 in 2001 to over 330,000 in 2019. An outsized ethanol-based “flex-fuel fleet” has helped offset emissions, but the rate of automobile growth still poses the most significant obstacle affecting transport over the next 30 years.
This key driver of change is, again, underlined by the structural enforcements of travel in Rio itself. Geographically, the city is difficult to cross, lying at the intersection of mountains, rainforest, and the Atlantic coast; its vastness is divided in four zones: North, South, West, and its downtown Centro, where half of the city’s jobs are concentrated. Unlike industrialized countries, where wealthier residents often live far away from city centers, Rio’s well-off are concentrated in the beachside South Zone, while low-income residents are increasingly pushed to the urban periphery. This segregation means that each day, millions trek to Centro for work, and more are expected with Greater Rio’s projected growth in the years ahead. Currently, at 52 minutes, Greater Rio has the highest home-to-work transit time of any metropolitan region in Brazil.
Assuming no interventions surface, the “Unsustainable Rio 2050” scenario projects that transport emissions will stay around 7,000 Gg of CO2e by 2030. Should the vehicular modal share hover near 25%, and 1 million people join the region’s population, 250,000 new cars and motorcycles on the road as well as continued air travel will largely offset fuel efficiencies of 35% to 40%, and 20%, respectively. Maintaining the current transport investments, as seen, will not have a significant impact. Greater Rio’s growth will raise automobile sales even higher by 2050, but new technology may limit emissions further to 5,000 to 6,000 Gg. Regardless, “business as usual” will continue.
The Road to Sustainability
Here’s the “Sustainable Rio 2050” scenario. To reiterate, Rio’s transport in 2020 makes up 35.9% of its emissions (7,371 Gg), with a modal share of 47.3% public transport users, including bus, subway, train, and light rail; walking, 27.24%; cars, 22.74%; and cycling, 1%. To arrive at a sustainable level, by 2050, Rio’s transport must equal only 0-5% of the city’s emissions (1,000 Gg or below; the IPCC-level sustainability). To reach this level, we need to arrive at a modal share of public transport users at 60%; walking, 30%; cycling, 5%; and cars, 5%. In the meantime, on path to this goal, by 2040, transport must make up 15% of emissions, with public transport at 57%; walking, 29%; cars, 10%; and cycling, 4%. And by 2030, Rio’s transport must make up 25% of emissions, with public transport at 55%; walking, 28%; cars, 15%; and cycling, 3%. 
This progression would bring a low-carbon transport future within reach by 2050. So how can this happen?
At the national level: investing in renewable energy, creating an intercity train network, installing eco-efficient freight networks, and implementing an air fuel tax should be explored to lower emissions from domestic and international transport. Rio itself already has a number of effective strategies available to boost non-vehicular modal shares within city limits. Shifting the BRT system to rail and improving bus service would help lessen travel time for riders. Expanding the BRT system could help too. But planners cannot repeat the same mistakes made in the lead-up to the 2016 Summer Olympics, when the BRT system was developed into to lower-need areas of the West Zone, displacing many in its wake and leading them to live further, not closer, to employment (and thus ultimately spending more time in traffic). Rather, BRT would be more impactful in the populous North Zone, where commuting times can reach up to three hours due to backlogged roads.
Robust, continuous, cycling infrastructure and rental networks should extend to the North Zone as well, helping to connect commuters to a large and safe network, along with affordable “last mile” solutions. Further efforts should increase sidewalk space, and make streets safer to walk. Additional train, light rail, and metro lines should also be developed, with greater seamless integration between the systems fundamental. Only if wide-reaching transport improvements are made can the city consider a minimal congestion surcharge to enter the South Zone or Centro; otherwise, charging car owners in this context encroaches upon aforementioned issues of equity. Assuming streets are safe enough, a citywide push for low- or zero-emission mopeds—increasingly an optimal choice of getting around—could offset expected growth.
The growth in automobile ownership, however, cannot be tackled without accounting for travel purposes, destinations, and the modes available. Average trips, as seen, are longest by car, at 22.1 km. A prerequisite of “Sustainable Rio 2050” is a reduction in structured travel to 50% or lower by 2050. One area for guidance is employment: researchers found notable disparities in commutes exist between informal and formal jobs. In Rio, 55% of residents are informally employed, meaning they work without employment papers, or are self-employed. This population is more likely to live closer to work, and not drive, with a mean commuting distance of 6.4km; thus, 23.2% walk. Formal employees, meanwhile, have a mean commuting distance of 10.6km, with only 16% of journeys made on foot. While shifting economic headwinds can be difficult, maintaining helpful facets of informal employment—e.g. incentives for working near home; stimulus for self-entrepreneurship—should be implemented.
As shown, however, where wealth and opportunity are concentrated, spatial inequities result. The city must do more to address this imbalance in access, by creating local and regional nodes for employment, shopping, and leisure in the North and West Zones, such as are promoted in the “15-minute city” trend in urban planning. Residents should not need to travel three hours to obtain a well-paying job; 50% of public transport trips should not be for educational or health services. Vital community infrastructure, like parks and cultural amenities, should be widely dispersed, not only available to upper strata. The need for a car to access the most basic of resources should be minimized at all costs. 
A case study can be found in Rio’s favelas, where residents travel significantly more by non-motorized modes than the rest of the city, according to a report from the Lincoln Institute. Most trips within the community are for leisure, shopping, and work, and only 3% of said trips are done by cars; when residents leave the favela, 50% of trips are for work. Recognizing that these neighborhoods have historically been marginalized, and steep slopes in some favelas discourage car use, the temporal nature of hyper-local services is worth mentioning here.
A sustainable future in Rio hinges on a dramatic rethinking of how the city functions for its residents and who the city is built for in the first place. Acknowledging trends in modal share and emissions, this article laid out the targets necessary to achieve a low-carbon transport future by 2050—as well as the realities of what would happen should inaction take hold—utilizing backcasting as its scenario analysis approach. The future, however, is not hopeless: Rio’s mobility has made inroads, and vehicular modal share remains lower than in many developed cities. But ‘pledges’ are threatened by rising car sales, population growth and haphazard transportation planning, which will hinder progress unless spatial inequities are addressed and comprehensive transportation planning undertaken. 
Rio, like any great city, is unique, but characteristics applicable in developing contexts upend typical transport planning assumptions. Planners must recognize area-specific dynamics at play; too often, ideas imported from Asian or European contexts have failed, or exacerbated existing tensions. In the words of Vasconcellos, policies for low-carbon transport must be both environmentally conscious and equitable to realize a green future for Rio. 
The world in quarantine offers a short glimpse of what that could look like, albeit under tragic pretences. Now comes the hard part

In
this new digital era, in which consumers demand everything to be faster and
more accessible, public and private transportation industries have suffered a
revolution due to the introduction of new shared mobility companies that are
changing the way people move from one place to another, either long or short
distances, and above all, focusing on time efficiency.  
In
this article, we will analyze particularly the electric scooter as a means of
transportation that has triggered several points of view, specifically since
its arrival to the Spanish market, and some of the reasons why these companies
have had trouble offering their services. 
Their
success around the world has been remarkable and, with a positive evolution,
they have managed to increase their users and have beaten their income records. Nevertheless, since the
first electric scooter company, Lime, set foot in Spain in 2018, companies have
faced several entry barriers trying to succeed in this market. 
Sociopolitical context 
The
misconception for shared mobility results from the idea of having junk lying on
the streets given that there are no assigned parking spaces for the equipment. 
The
government disapproves the lack of organization of scooter placement, but they
are not willing to fully cooperate in order to assign parking spots. This brings
a constant disagreement in which the companies present a business model and the
Town Hall constantly rejects or partially approves it. 
Since
every city in Spain is independent and makes its own decisions about public
transportation management, electric scooter firms are facing situations in
which some cities establish over-regulations on companies’ operations and, on
the other hand, they encounter no regulations at all. 
The
regulation policies based on over-occupation of electric scooters in public
spaces has led to consumers having the impression that they do not care neither
about them nor the people that do not need to use this service, but equally get
affected by it.

In
2019, in the city of Madrid, 25 applications were received from different
electric scooter companies requesting authorization to introduce their brands
to the market, only 18 were accepted and could only deploy 8% from the total
number of requested units. From these 18 different brands, only 16 are fighting
to acquire new clients since there were two important merges between Flash and
Koko, and Mobo and Wheels. 
Among
the established regulations in this community, one stands out: the every
morning task they have to perform of arranging each scooter to its assigned
parking area in different neighborhoods across the city, making it impossible
for companies to strategically locate their units in convenient areas that
could make it easier for the user to find them and use them.
As
a result of these policies, the customer effort score shows high levels as the
customer has to use several Apps from different brands in order to move around
the city causing a lack of interest to use this service and turning to another
one. 
Despite the fact that Barcelona is considered
one of the most bike-friendly cities in the World, the main focus of city
regulations for shared electric scooters is the tourism industry as it has been
stipulated that “the personal mobility vehicles can be used only when they
perform a commercial activity, of tourism or leisure with profit purposes and
with a guide.” Also, they must follow specific circulation rules, otherwise
they could receive fines from 100 to 500 euros, depending on the gravity of the
misconduct. 
Reby is an example of how the electric scooter
companies are adapting to these regulations; they have installed locks in the
scooters to park them and avoid the public inconvenience.

At the same time, companies and some cities face
the lack of regulation of shared scooters (e.g. Málaga) where citizens have
filed constant complains about the massive occupation of the equipment in
public spaces because they block the sidewalk making it very difficult for
pedestrians to move freely and also they occupy exclusive parking spaces
originally designed for motorcycles and bicycles. 
Sociocultural context 
The overprotection of public transport over the
shared mobility models in Spain, has caused that electric scooters are considered
direct competitors for public transportation and not a complement service for
the users. 
A recent study, conducted by the company Wind,
shows that 30% of the journeys in Milan, Paris and Bordeaux started and
finished in a subway, bus, or train station. This company thinks that this
shows an interest of the client to complement the public service instead of
replacing it whit electric scooters. 
Added to the city regulations in Spain, the
scooter companies find a lack of interest from these government branches as
there are very few public contests compared to other countries in Europe such
as Germany, France, or Italy. 
The lack of available tools for the electric
scooter companies in Spain is causing that they face much more barriers for
unit deployment and efficient service performance as a complement for public
transportation providing that all the shared mobility elements work together in
perfect harmony as they do in other European markets. 

Technological Context
In many cities it is common that urban planning
is a constant challenge because of the increasing populations and the new
transportation methods. People are growing to be more cautious about the risk
that represents that the bicycle lanes are few, of bad quality and that they
are not properly connected to each other. 
Driven by the interest for providing a good
service and achieving profitability, companies have offered their help for
planning and management of shared mobility through the analysis of gathered
data by their units, as they are 100% technological. 
They have proved that team effort along with
cities that show interest to potentialize this service can help to plan and correctly
execute the stablished regulations based on current data; for example, the
proper establishment of parking zones that do not interfere with pedestrians or
other services and their placement in strategic areas. 
Demographic
Context
Shared mobility is a density business, that
means that it requires a specific quantity of deployed electric scooters on the
streets to get the service to work properly.
One of the biggest challenges for electric
scooters companies is the fact that they can assure that the customer will find
any scooter on a comfortable and useful distance, in this way, it represents
the possibility of building a habit of using this service every day.
The success of public transportation and shared
bicycles is due to the security they give the user to be able to find these
services at any place and constant times that are previously determined. They
are part of the user’s daily mobility routine, and this is something that
scooters cannot offer since the balance between the density of equipment
deployed and its use is not optimal.
“If there are no electric
scooters near de user, they probably would not pick one up because they are not
willing to walk around 15 minutes just to get to use one.”(Gerard,
Sellarès, responsible of Wind Mobility South Europe) 
Post-Covid Challenge
During the sanitary crisis in Spain, companies
faced heavy losses around March and have continued in this way until recent
months. This caused some of them to re-evaluate the product supply strategy,
adapting it to the necessary sanitary measures.
According to the results of the surveys carried
out by Statista Global Consumer Service 2020, the most used means of
transportation in Spain are those in which a large number of users are
transported. This list is headed by the subway and the bus, followed by smaller
means of transport such as the taxi or the car, which continue to be
transportations that suppose a risk of contagion since they transport more than
2 people.
That is why in the new normality, the commitment
in the shared mobility sector is focused on the exponential growth of the use
of individual means, such as electric scooters so that, in this way, the
statistics of the most common means of transportation in this country can be
reversed. 
According to Business Insider,
in New York the use of bicycles increased 52% in mid-March, as a result of the
distrust of the use of public transport with large capacities, increasing the
risk of contagion.

Conclusions  
The launch of shared electric scooters around
the world has been a different challenge in every city. Spain has proved that
in order to introduce a product and or service in any market, a complete
strategic context analysis is required, since scooters have come to
revolutionize the way we go from point “a” to point “b”. 
The different regulations for unit deployment
and for the use of these equipment that the cities have established are a
particular way to allow companies to compete almost freely, as they work
under similar “ground rules” and those than can continue working, will thrive;
without adequate regulations these companies will not achieve the ideal profit
in order to stay on Spain. 
The disadvantages of electric scooter use can decrease
and be controlled if there are appropriate measures and rules to stablish
limits to a service that was introduced suddenly, as it is important for
inhabitants and scooter users that the integrity and security of everyone is
being looked after. 
One solution that has been proposed for this
subject in order to satisfy city hall, users and pedestrians is the
implementation of A/B tests in different environments in order to locate
different needs and suitability for each city. 

There have been proposals of tests in which
certain companies with a certain number of units in streets, can test free
markets, where the service these companies are offering is simply based on
supply and demand, that is to say that there are no limitations; on the other
hand, there are companies that regulate and control the market where they
spread the units. 
“Each city is a world, but inside each city, a
different zone is a world” (Gerard Sellarès)
Nevertheless, the upsides of electric scooter
use are many. They come to complete a public transportation service and they
pose a benefit that goes beyond direct profit for these companies, as they look
for a cleaner environment, a decrease in traffic, and faster and more efficient
mobility. 
Finally, the most important challenge that
electric scooter companies are facing (in short and medium terms) is to search
for the correct strategy and “play well their cards” in order to compete
against the massive use of public transportation and the growing tendency that
has been observed in which people are buying their own scooter or bike. 
Companies have focused their communications towards projecting security, trust, convenience and to show their clients that the good reasons to keep using their service as a complement to public transport are many and to encourage them to build a new responsible and safe habit.

By Rich Miller
The road to the self-driving car of the future is paved with hardware and data centers. Autonomous vehicles promise to be one of the transformational technologies of the 21st century, with the potential to remake much of our urban and economic landscape.
But many questions remain about how the connected car of 2019 will evolve to meet the vision for the autonomous vehicles of the future, and tough issues to be resolved on multiple fronts – including technology, regulation and infrastructure.
The long-term vision is to create networks of connected vehicles that “talk” to one another using vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications over low-latency wireless connections, which can also allow vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) that enable robot cars to connect with traffic lights and parking meters. At present, there are dueling visions for the wireless technologiy that will allow autonomous vehicles to communicate.
The transition to autonomous cars will be gradual, occurring in phases and at a variable pace in different geographies, based on local regulation and the availability of connectivity and data storage to support these services. One thing is certain: The cars of the future will create huge volumes of data, and that will create demand for digital infrastructure to support the industry’s growth.
Lots of Data in Lots of Places
The progress of autonomous vehicle projects has been uneven, as seen in recent headlines. Last week Google’s Waymo division said it would begun using fully driverless minivans – with no support driver – in a ride-sharing service it operates in the Phoenix area. Meanwhile, startup Optimus Ride launched a shuttle service in Reston, Va. featuring low-speed autonomous vehicles.
At the other end of the spectrum was Tesla’s rollout of  a “smart summon” feature of its self-driving software, which quickly became the star of viral videos suggesting the beta technology (and maybe some of its users) may not be smart enough just yet.
Autonomous vehicles are the equivalent of supercomputers rolling down the highway, generating and transmitting a mind-boggling amount of data – up to 4 terabytes per day, per car. Most analysts expect the data requirements of self-driving vehicles will be split, with some duties managed by powerful on-board computers, and others offloaded to external facilities for additional data-crunching and storage.
As driverless vehicles take to the roads, they will require low-latency wireless connections to fiber networks and data centers. This connectivity, storage and data-crunching infrastructure may need to extend to almost everywhere cars can drive.
The data center impact of connected cars can already be seen in the compute needs of leading ride-sharing and logistics services.
Ride-sharing service Lyft has run on Amazon Web Services since its launch in 2012, and plans to spend more than $300 million to run IT infrastructure on AWS through 2021, the company said in recent SEC filings. Lyft uses AWS’ auto-scaling feature to ramp its capacity up and down, matching its infrastructure to the volume of its business. Lyft says its Saturday night peak volume is 8 times higher than activity just hours later on Sunday morning.
Uber has charted a different course, working with wholesale data center providers to lease space for its rapid global expansion. The company’s data center team has defined a 5-megawatt  deployment that will serve as the building block for the company’s network. Each zone features 10,000 to 15,000 square feet of data center space, leased on a five-year term, with a right of first refusal on 5 megawatts of adjacent space. A zone contains 576 racks, which are divided among standardized groupings of hardware for base compute, storage and machine learning.
Creating The Automotive Edge
The automotive sector is shaping up as a potential game-changer for edge computing. To meet this challenge, the Automotive Edge Computing Consortium (AECC) was formed in 2018 to develop strategies for moving big data between vehicles, edge data centers and the cloud. AECC founding members include AT&T, Intel, Ericsson, NTT, KDDI and Sumitomo Electric.
The AECC estimates that data traffic from autonomous vehicles could surpass 10 exabytes per month by 2025 – about 1,000 times the present volume.
“The present network deployments and business models do not yet support the future needs of connected vehicles,” the group said in a white paper. “There will be a need for new network architectures and computing infrastructure to support massive computing resources and topology-aware storage capacity in terms of balancing quality and cost.
“Our aim is to deploy this redesigned system architecture on a global scale, which will require collaboration among worldwide partners and the system architecture to comply with the relevant standards.”
Startups like Vapor IO and EdgeMicro are deploying the early phases of edge computing networks incorporating micro-data centers, enclosures offering between 48 kW and 300 kW of compute capacity. These modules are designed to be deployed on rooftops and cell tower sites.
Another connection point will be charging stations deployed by electric vehicle manufacturers. Tesla and other electric vehicles are equipped with wireless connectivity to enable “over the air” updates to software.
Charging stations offer the opportunity for batch uploads over fast Wi-Fi connections to offload trip data, and download video, audio, map updates and other data-intensive digital services.
In April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company would soon add free WiFi at all of its 12,700 Supercharger stations that offer rapid charging on popular routes. The company also operates a global network of 22,000 “destination chargers” at hotels, malls and movie theaters. There are also public party charging options like EVgo, whose network of more than 1,000 fast chargers is used by BMW, Nissan and GM owners.
Designed and built by Tesla, Supercharger stations charge Model S, Model X and Model 3 in minutes rather than hours.  They will also soon offer free WiFi. (Image: Tesla)
Competing Standards for Future V2V, V2I Traffic
V2V technology is crucial to hopes that autonomous vehicles can dramatically reduce traffic congestion in major cities, integrating location-aware cars, traffic lights and toll gates to enable seamless merging at speed, easing the backups seen at intersections and toll plazas.
DSRC (Dedicated Short-Range Communications) is based on the 802.11p WiFi standard, and can support very low-latency, secure transmissions, and the ability to handle rapid and frequent handovers seen in a V2V environment. DSRC is also highly robust in poor weather conditions.Cellular V2X (C-V2X) uses the existing cellular long-term evolution (LTE) network and eventually the new 5G wireless standard. Its backers say it can also support reliable, real-time communication at high speeds in high-density traffic.
DSRC has been eyed for automotive use since 2004, when the FCC dedicated 75 MHz of bandwidth at 5.9 GHz to be used for vehicle safety and other mobility applications. It has had strong support from General Motors and Toyota, who have installed DSRC equipment in some of their newer vehicles.
But the competing C-V2X technology has gained momentum, with strong support from mobile operators and equipment makers, including Intel, Ericsson, Nokia and Qualcomm. Automakers BMW, Audi and Daimler also support C-V2X. Backers of C-V2X point to limited real-world adoption of DSRC.
In January, Ford announced plans to install C-V2X support in all new U.S. models by 2022. ““Our hope is that this would spur others to potentially reassess and, in other cases, decide on this direction,” said Don Butler, who heads Ford’s connected vehicle platform, in an interview with Bloomberg. “We’ve been looking at DSRC for a number of years along with Toyota, GM and Honda, so this is not a step that we take lightly in the sense of dismissing DSRC. But we think this is the right step to make given where we see the technology headed.”
Ford’s move seems to have indeed shifted the landscape. In April, Toyota said it was halting plans to install DSRC in its new vehicles, citing “the need for greater automotive industry commitment as well as federal government support to preserve the 5.9 GHz spectrum band for DSRC.”
Changes in Washington are a factor. The Obama administration supported DSRC and backed a mandate that would force automakers to standardize on DSRC, but the Trump administration has been vocal in its support of 5G, and FCC chair Ajit Pai has advocated opening up the spectrum reserved for DSRC to other uses, including C-V2X.
Mobile Micro Clouds
At the DataCloud Edge conference last fall in Austin, Toyota researcher Onur Altintas laid out a vision for “vehicular micro-clouds” that coordinate their movement through low-latency communications.
Altintas, a fellow at the Toyota InfoTechnology Center in Mountain View, Calif., noted that the industry has yet to standardize how to handle data moving between vehicles from competing automakers. He said automotive OEMs are working to define what data will be shared with other vehicles in “micro clouds” and what data will be kept private.
Micro-clouds can be organized in two models:
Stationary Micro-Cloud: This approach anchors the cloud to a geographic region, in which cars join the micro-cloud when entering the region and hand-off data & tasks when exiting. Parked cars can also be part of the micro-cloud.Mobile Micro-Cloud: This approach features an ad-hoc formation, with one vehicle serving as a “cloud leader” that recruits cloud members and distributes sub-tasks for collaborative task execution. The micro cloud moves along roads with the motion of the cloud leader.
The micro-cloud approach supports more efficient data flow because data moves across low-latency connections between physically adjacent cars, rather than a longer route across the network to a regional edge data center or even a distant core data center.

An interview with Matt Cole, conducted before his departure as the President of Cubic Transportation Systems. Interviewed by Gordon Feller, Founder of Meeting of the Minds.
Gordon Feller: One question that’s often asked by public sector executives who’re responsible for their city’s transport services: ‘how should city leaders be thinking about the future of urban transit?’
Matt Cole: We’re in an exciting period of history; it’s now possible to see the potential for truly unlocking the multi-modal journey as a competitor to single occupancy vehicles. This is being caused partly by increased investment in public transit, at least in some locations. Some breakthroughs are possible now because of the arrival of new forms of mobility, whether it’s bike-share, scooter-share, ridesharing, carsharing, and more. There are so many different options available now for people to use in their urban journey. This means connecting to public transit has become a more viable option because people can take these other services from their first mile, or their last mile, to transit. Therefore, promoting transit is a genuinely viable option for many more in the city, relative to driving their cars from point A to point B.
How should elected and appointed officials think about these new urban mobility options?
Matt Cole: I think that it’s time for public officials to be promoting transit as the most efficient form of travel. And it’s also time for them to build partnerships with the ecosystem of other mobility providers, in order to enable easy access to public transit.  Working together, these stakeholders can lead in two ways: designing what mobility network they want in the future in their locality, and building the necessary partnerships to tie into that platform.
There are many different dimensions of the 360-degree viewpoint which you’re putting forward here. You’ve personally spent a lot of time pioneering, and developing, a new approach that’s sometimes called ‘Mobility-as-a-Service’ (MaaS) What exactly is MaaS, and where does Cubic fit in all of that.
There are multiple definitions out there of “mobility-as-a-service.” These range from some of the early-stage approaches, which focused on subscription plans and pricing, and not necessarily the outcomes. But, in my own view, that approach to “MaaS” was trying to promote all sorts of things that needed to exist in order to enable mobility. My own view is this: we’re working to enable mobility networks in cities and regions that promote journey choices. The emphasis is on journey choices that can range from the most affordable to the most efficient, or the most environmentally sustainable. But the aim is to enable all of the possible journey choices for all of the possible travelers. That means addressing the needs of every customer segment that needs to travel within a given city or region. We’re trying to enable those choices for everyone.
How are you and Cubic doing this?
We do this by delivering three primary elements. First: An integrated user experience allows you to plan, book, and pay for all of your journeys in one place.
Second: A single account system that enables that booking and payment component. This allows you to have all of your payment transactions in one place which are related to how you move on the ground. Should governments and public officials want to do so, they can take an integrated approach. This means that a single fair price exists for a single journey – even one that might consist of a scooter-share, a transit-ride, and a bike-share, for example. That single account system underpins the user’s integrated account information, but equally crucial is integrated policy for public officials in government.
Third: An integrated network management tool which allows cities and regions to optimize how individual operators collectively respond to incidents and anomalies. This is focused on the many varied ways that the transportation system is performing on any given day.
It sounds like Cubic’s new approach, and the new type of services that you offer, are not about simply doing a better job with fare collecting, or doing a better job with tracking asset flows or revenue flows through the transit system. Now you’re providing solutions that touch on many of the other local priorities, things like public safety.
Yes, absolutely.
In the hundreds of cities where you operate, Cubic is not known by many as a comprehensive services provider. Can you talk a little bit about how that’s manifesting in some of the places where you have a very large footprint, such as London and New York?
For eight years we’ve had a mobility-as-a-service strategy that we call NextCity. Some people haven’t necessarily seen Cubic’s transformation during that eight-year period, but the fact is that our business significantly broadened from what it used to be. We have the benefit of a phenomenal legacy in leading the transit payments industry for nearly five decades. But in the last decade, particularly in the last eight years since we launched NextCity, we filled out many other business elements. Within our payments business, for example, we’ve developed a tolling business, which enables us to provide the tolling system for such complex places as the U.S. State of New Hampshire.
We’ve filled out a suite of APIs that enable integration of first-mile and last-mile transport modes. We have a mobile applications and mobile payments business. In terms of the application that transit riders will use to pay for their journeys, this business has 61 percent of the U.S. transit market committed to it. And aligned to that, but separately, we’ve formed a business called Cubic Interactive, which is a mobile advertising offers and loyalty business.
Would you describe one key example?
We’ve diversified the business, especially in terms of transportation network operations management and optimization. We’ve made a series of acquisitions and organic investments. For example, we acquired NextBus in 2013 because they’re a leader in predicting when buses are going to arrive at their stop. Their technologies make that information available for both agencies and travelling public.
Would you describe one more example?
In 2013 we acquired a U.K. traffic management business that mostly focuses on small highways and motorways, which, in the American phraseology, means freeways. Their technologies detect something that’s happening on a road, such as a disabled vehicle, through the use of various kinds of sensors. They bring that information back to a control room, where software programs analyze the incident and provide operators with options and roles. The aim is simple: to enable corrective actions which they could take in order to deal with the situation. Since that acquisition was first made, we’ve invested new resources into that business.
In what ways are the pieces of the puzzle being put together by the organizations that operate complex transportation networks?
We recently won a really exciting contract in Sydney, Australia. This one is probably closest to what we’ve been talking about here. It’s an intelligent congestion management program which has a truly multimodal control room and a multimodal response platform. The platform allows Transport New South Wales, which is the lead agency down there, to predict 30 minutes into the future what’s going to happen on their transportation network, and then to act within five minutes.
We also founded Urban Insights in 2014, an analytics team created to deliver data-driven insights that will shape the urban transportation network of the future, enable greater mobility, and make cities more efficient in the provisioning of transportation services. In the past year, we also acquired two businesses that are associated with intersection management and optimization of the flow of traffic through an intersection. They do so by using sensor technology to determine demand from north, south, east, and west – and then prioritize red and green, in directions that enable the most flow through the intersection. We built out quite a suite of businesses that can deal with both safety and network optimization challenges which cities have, all related to transportation.
How does a public sector executive help his agency to pay for some or all of those interesting services? Is it sufficient to look at the farebox in the public transit system, or is there a need to do public-private-partnerships? Or, is there some other model that you have in mind when you talk with public agencies about these new kinds of services?
No doubt about it: there are going to be different funding sources available for many of these projects. In general, the majority of our contracts come from a combination of capital and operating dollars that the agencies have, on the operating side. Obviously, a portion of that comes from the farebox. But, in the case of both capital and operating budgets, it’s to differing extents. Funding streams from local, state/provincial, and federal government do play a key role. The majority of our projects are financed that way. Some recent large capital raises have been noteworthy, such as the very recent one by the New York MTA, with their new capital plan to fund initiatives like this, as well as much bigger ones. In general, that’s what we’re seeing with regard to the sourcing of funds.
Are there some useful alternatives?
Yes. We’re building a system right now in the City of Boston which is a true “P3contract” A public-private partnership (PPP or P3) is a contract between a public sector entity and a private sector entity that outlines the provision of assets and the delivery of services. … It facilitates and, in some cases, manages partnerships on behalf of public sector agencies. We’ve partnered with the John Laing Company who’ve formed a joint venture with Cubic to raise the financing needed to build systems. That’s certainly an option which is available for much bigger technology projects like that one.
There are other options. For example, when we built the Chicago Ventra system, Cubic actually financed that from its balance sheet. Chicago Transit Agency was the primary customer that repays the system build over an operational services term. We did something similar with LA Metro for their new mobile app: they’re paying Cubic nothing upfront, and all of our payment stream is based on transaction fees that will come to us once we’ve launched the application. Thus, there are different funding models out there, but the most prevalent one is agencies using a combination of farebox and government funding to pay for new services.
Funding is certainly one big challenge lurking in the minds of public sector executives who want to do this. Can you talk about one or two other big obstacles that you and your team have seen? Since you’ve described some funding strategies, and how to blow up those obstacles, maybe there are one or two other obstacles that can be overcome which you’d want to highlight here?
One obstacle which is particularly related to MaaS is the complexity of the environment. Look at places like Los Angeles or San Francisco Bay Area or Frankfurt or Brisbane or Sydney. Setting aside mobility-as-a-service for a moment, just look at the transit network. Those cities which I just mentioned have integrated complex transit networks through a single payment system. It’s a combination of private and public bus and rail operators, plus ferry operators in some of them. In some cases you have a convening organization, such as the Bay Area’s Metropolitan Transportation Commission, but often times you don’t.
LA ‘s lead agency is LA Metro, yet more than 20 regional partner operators there don’t have any kind of hierarchical relationship to LA Metro, and these operators are participating in that same network.
It’s no small feat to address the relationship management challenges, and to work through the various and different contractual agreements which need to be put in place in order to integrate those services. Obviously, that situation gets more complex once you start bringing in other public agencies (such as a tolling agency or a congestion charging agency), as well as private operators (such as ride-share, scooter-share, bike-share).
Setting aside the funding and the business model challenges, what is the major obstacle?
It is this: who’s going to be lead coordinator? Who brings together the combination of private and public sector organizations that really need to partner in order to make MaaS work. As in the case just highlighted with L.A. and San Francisco, a public agency needs to take that lead. I believe that needs to be done in a way where the public interest, meaning the welfare and the needs of every individual in the region, is considered. I don’t know how you do that unless it’s public agency that takes the lead.
We’re talking here about the challenges created by digital innovation for transit and transport in the city. The privacy and security of personally identifiable digital content has become top-of-mind for many public sector executives. Whether it be a rider on the transit system purchasing a fare, or downloading an app, or navigating the city using that app, public agencies increasingly hear distress from the public about data security and data sanctity. The pushback which Sidewalk Labs has seen in Toronto was very much one part of that story. Can you talk about Cubic’s thinking on the digital security of personally identifiable data?
We must give people a choice. We need to give people a promise of value flowing back to them. We need to make a commitment that their information is safe. We live in a world where people want to share their information in varying amounts of detail. Some people are prepared to share a lot about themselves, in some cases on social media, while other people are quite private in the ways they conduct their lives, wanting to share as little as they possibly can. I think that needs to be respected; technology platforms need to be architected and built to give people that choice. How much information do you want to share, and yet still be able to enjoy the core benefits of the city mobility system?
One example here: in all of our SmartCloud systems, transit riders can choose whether they register their card, or not. If they would rather their card not be linked to their identity, they can use the card anonymously, and they still enjoy the majority of the benefits of the system. Whereas, those who choose to register their card and link it to their identity enjoy incremental benefits. These include card protection (if they lose their cards), or they can do a balance transfer, for instance. But, fundamentally, whether you register the card or not, you still get most of the benefits of the system. For those who do choose to share their information, we’ve got to make a promise to them: we’re going to use that information, but in a way that makes their lives better.
Helping commuters to proactively and predictively manage their journey is possible because you know a bit more about them?
Yes, and Cubic Interactive is designed to give the commuters a direct economic benefit. Given the complex cyber environment we’re all living within, systems that do hold private information need to adhere to the very best data protection standards.
What you’re doing with MTA in New York or with Transport for London is not your traditional contract for services. Since cities essentially are partnering with Cubic, it’s not in the form of a traditional vendor relationship. You’re jointly solving problems. after the local agencies sign a contract, these solutions aren’t just being handed to them on a silver platter. How do you think about your partnerships with public agencies?
It’s certainly an aspiration for us to have all of our customer relationships reach such a partnership standard. For me, the definition of a partnership is that it’s not an arms-length relationship where one party procures a defined thing from another party. Instead, we strive for jointly working together as partners towards a common outcome. Obviously, in the end you are two separate organizations and each organization has its own priorities, its own measurements, and its own needs. When you find a way to align those things, such that you create partnership behavior, that’s when you really see phenomenal results. And certainly, in places like London and Brisbane and New York, we’ve achieved those things because we have great working partnerships there.
Can you share your big picture view of what can be expected in 2020 and beyond, by way of progress? For instance, how will Cubic intersect with AV solutions that are coming soon to a street near you?
There are connected vehicles, and then there’s autonomous vehicles (AVs). I do think that the potential for AVs is incredible, especially in terms of the new mobility services which become available. Also, we can expect the ability with AVs to more completely optimize the flow of traffic. But AVs are still quite some time away from being prevalent in our cities. Thinking now about near-term use cases that we will see in 2020, look to Trafficware and GRIDSMART. These are the intersection optimization businesses which we acquired, and they’re making some exciting progress with connected vehicles. They enable cars to talk to infrastructure, and to other cars, as they approach intersections. In 2020 this will make it possible for traffic signals to tell the car how many seconds it’s going to be until they turn red, or what average speed they need to maintain so they arrive at the intersection perfectly, as the light turns green.

By 2050, the UN predicts the world will have 10 billion citizens and three billion additional cars. With a strain already visible on UK cities trying to manage significant automobile numbers, city parking planning and infrastructure need to be reimagined to cope with the expected growth.
The alternative will mean three billion people cannot each have a vehicle, and social mobility will suffer.
How can advancements in smart parking technology better manage vehicle growth and reduce it without unjustly limiting public mobility?
The Trouble With Traffic
While increased traffic flow can be beneficial for areas looking to boost visitors and tourism revenues, busier roadways pose significant challenges for local councils trying to manage driver behavior and satisfy public opinion.
Today, 55 percent of the world’s population lives in urban areas, and England is amongst the world’s worst countries for traffic jams.  It has been estimated the average British motorist lost 31 hours and nearly £1,200 from being stuck in traffic jams in 2018 alone. A shortfall in parking availability has been noted as a significant contributor to this type of congestion in cities.  Incredibly, research suggests drivers looking for parking spaces now make up 30 percent of all urban traffic.
In most UK cities, demand for parking far outstrips supply. This presents authorities with the challenge of balancing the needs of visitors with those of residents so parking is available when needed at a fair price.
Destressing With Data
Parking authorities can now deploy digital technologies to help reduce daily stresses for city drivers. For example, mobile parking and permit solutions can help cities operate more efficiently and manage demand. Something as simple as removing the hassle of coins and improving online or on-the-phone communication between local authorities and users will help to increase customer satisfaction. Data from virtual payment systemscan also be seamlessly supplied to enforcement teams to ensure accurate operations.
Connected digital parking and permitting services can also be deployed to generate insightful big data that will help solve mobility challenges. Local authorities can combine large datasets, such as analysis of traffic flows, with real-time on-street parking demand. This can then enable the setting of demand-led parking tariffs and inform decisions around traffic management policies, the building of new parking facilities, and the development of new resident parking schemes.
Emissions Management in Busy Cities
However, the need for innovative methods for managing congestion and public demand is not the only bi-product of population growth. While agricultural and industrial sectors are significant contributors to global warming, transport causes more greenhouse gas pollution than any other sector.
Evidence suggests public transport has the potential to replace 21 percent of existing car journeys in urban areas around the UK. Constituents are often encouraged to ditch the cars and take public transport or ride-share to reduce transport’s impact on greenhouse gas increases,  but while buses are the most used form of public transport when it comes to local journeys, their use has declined by 11 percent in the last ten years. If predictions of three billion extra cars by 2050 ring true, transport emissions will multiply.
Local authorities may have to consider introducing dynamic pricing to nudge drivers to go to other car parks or routes where their vehicles will not tip pollution levels over safe legal limits or targets. “Dirty” vehicles have the potential to trip cities over pollution limits that could degrade air quality and even increase calls to the NHS.
Communicating this information through a smart driving app, or directly through a car’s inboard computer system, could revolutionize the way cities, their visitors and residents share the responsibility to meet zero-emissions targets.
From parking to safety, pollution to social inclusion, by collecting, sharing and analyzing big data, cities can ensure they’re fit for the future. Connected public services have the potential to dramatically improve residents’ quality of life

American runs on trucking, from 18-wheelers to light trucks that can navigate impossible urban streets.
Trucking is the lifeline by which food appears overnight in our supermarkets, and a host of other products that use the highways as a circulatory system to supply a nation’s needs.
Those lofty platitudes aside, much of trucking and logistics is stuck in another decade and, in rare cases, the last century. Andrew Leone, CEO of logistics startup Dispatch, just couldn’t stand the inefficiency anymore. So, he did something about it. Just don’t call him a disruptor.
“Disruptor is a term that’s thrown around a lot these days,” Leone told PYMNTS. “I’d say absolutely we’re an innovator. What we’re doing is bringing a very antiquated space up to current standards and beyond.”
“When I think of a true disruption,” he joked, “that’d be like inventing teleportation logistics. I think we’re probably somewhere in between true innovation and maybe some disruption.”
Pointing to shrinking delivery windows that have gone from seven days to two days to next-day to same-day in about five years, Leone, like others, is focusing on “last mile” logistics for companies that don’t have the investment clout to build their own systems.
Noting that final-mile delivery has undergone major change after having historically required tons of capital, Leone told PYMNTS that “Most organizations aren’t doing tens of billions of dollars where they can invest in that level of infrastructure. But they still have to compete.”
That’s where Dispatch tech comes into play.
“Regardless of whether they’re [a small- to medium-sized business (SMB)] or an enterprise, companies have the ability to tap into a fleet of vehicles or capacity to be able to deliver not [just] same-day, but within an hour.”
Dispatch has combined the Grubhub-style aggregator model with the Uber-like rideshare method for a gig-based approach to logistics. Dispatch recruits drivers who, after being thoroughly vetted, use their own vehicles in an update of same-day courier service.
“Automate The Entire Piece”
Leone has plans to be operating in 50 U.S. markets by the fall; the company is currently in over 40.
To help make this happen, Dispatch plans to debut its own delivery management platform in the fall, where orders for auto parts or printed retail signage will be routed by the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) so that use of truck inventory and opportunity can better align.
“Our goal is to completely cover the nation, so this is available in every single market,” he said. “That’s the delivery piece of our business. The idea is that [companies] don’t have to manage a fleet. They don’t have to manage outsourcing. That is all handled through our software holistically so that a distributor or a business can tie us into their eCommerce environment, into their ERP system, and then we facilitate that final mile delivery, whether it’s with their existing assets on our outsourced network. It doesn’t really matter. We automate that entire piece.”
The majority of Dispatch’s business is B2B — think of an auto parts store supplying nearby repair shops, paper goods going to restaurants, signage to retail stores — that kind of thing. It’s smaller parcels delivered quickly, with total app-based trackability.
Distribution A “Massive” Opportunity
Dispatch is a reminder how FedEx and UPS went from dull to dazzling as they became more a feature — and a valuable service — in everyday life. Leone is reticent to compare his startup with those giants of enterprise, but he’s not afraid of fighting for his share of their market.
“In the U.S. alone, distribution is a $6 trillion business,” he said. “It’s a third of U.S. GDP. It’s a massive, massive space.”
Leone’s sites are set on a nice slice of that action, as are others.
This is why, as the nation hunkered down at home, Leone and his team stayed busy expanding into nine more U.S. markets during the depths of the pandemic lockdowns. Since cratering in April, Leone has seen month-over-month volume improvements.
“Supply chain, final-mile innovation and strategy are things that a lot of businesses know they need to do, but when you’re gobbling up market share, operational expenses and some of that other stuff seems less important,” he told PYMNTS.
Having raised $22 million from investors to date, Leone said the money is going into system investments that increase driver earnings and put an end to logistical inefficiencies like a truck dropping off its freight and returning to the depot empty.
Here’s the point: Margins on that trip could be improved with an AI-powered platform that matches trucks to loads, maximizing utilization, Leone said. And he means to do it.

Billions of dollars have gone into the development of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology, with some manufacturers slowly introducing more sophisticated cruise control, braking and stability systems, driver alerts and other features, and others who are “going the extra mile” with full-on automation of vehicles including delivery trucks and shuttles within confined geographies (college campuses for example).
The forecasts for truly autonomous vehicles interacting on public roads and highways range greatly, and public opinion varies; while drivers understand the benefits, they are also wary of letting go of the wheel, or others letting go of the wheel. Stories in the media, including those about fatal collisions, are not helping.
There are no fully autonomous cars and trucks on public roads without at least a human overseer on board, which is prudent given the early nature of the evolution of AVs. Despite what some may perceive as constraints to innovation, an enormous amount of energy, attention and investment is underway in the United States of America, and where public agencies work with the AV “ecosystem,” we can expect to see real progress as we head into 2020 making the next decade spurred along by the roll out of 5G networks, more lit fiber and other infrastructure improvements.
We spoke with Christopher Bonanti, an expert in autonomous driving research, regulation and innovation, who served as a senior executive at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and in leadership roles at several other governmental agencies.
With a background including management, engineering and regulatory and compliance consulting, Bonanti has led significant projects in transportation, environmental planning, traffic safety and is a pioneer in moving Vehicle to Vehicle communication research. He has drafted autonomous vehicle policy and guidance for the United States and has served his country through work at the NHTSA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and as a staffer at both the U.S. Congress and Senate.
He was recently recruited to establish a Strategic Advisory Services arm of Rocket Wagon Venture Studios, based in Chicago, as VP and General Manager of the practice.
Bonanti, who is based in the Washington DC Metro area, is bringing his experience and insights to enterprises and organizations challenged with how they can create value in the IoT and Industrial IoT domains.
“Compared to other countries, the United States is taking an admirably comprehensive approach to ensuring that autonomous vehicles are safe, practical, environmentally friendly and otherwise poised to grow over the long term, which has the potential to drive economic growth while making transportation substantially better,” Bonanti said.
“We’ve been using cruise control for decades, and cars today are rich with computerized systems with basic driver functions. We’ve also learned that partial automation of a feature like automatic emergency braking has moved off the whiteboards and onto the streets, with great acceptance by consumers,” Bonanti said. “It’s been exciting to see lane keeping taking off, but despite the buzz on fully automated vehicles, using AI and other software and connectivity systems to work without human intervention, it’s going to take time to reach this milestone, but perhaps less time than some think. Drones, for example, will mature at a different pace than vehicles on busy urban streets. A fully computer-controlled Level V vehicle, ready to roll under any conditions with no steering wheel in sight is a few years away, even though testbeds are proving these vehicles can work.”
Whether using lidar projectors, machine learning, cameras, radar or ultrasonic sensors, for fully automated vehicles to work and become fail safe, contextual, dimensional, and/or real-time data-drive mapping systems must be in place. Bonanti believes we’ll continue to watch the debates on what will truly work, but says the same basic foundations apply regardless of the equipment, software or protocols.  
“After so many years working in this arena,” Bonanti said, “it’s exciting to see start-ups investing and innovating in Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communications, which goes beyond Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) to vehicles to interact with static things, including traffic lights, motion detection systems, and more. There will be big winners in the V2X market, once ‘silicon economics’ kicks in and the prices for the technology required across multiple public and private projects goes way down. With enough money, humans can build practically anything – but practically speaking, nothing this expensive and unproven will scale without mass production.”
The Role of Government and the Potential of Ongoing Public-Private Partnerships
As a former member of the U.S. Senior Executive Service (SES) and the Associate Administrator for Rulemaking at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Bonanti was the senior executive responsible for developing, writing and implementing rules, regulations, and standards for all ground transportation vehicles sold within the U.S., including the auto, trucking, motor coach, and motorcycle industries.
These regulations included all Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), and the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) standard regulations for automobiles and light trucks, as well as, fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy-duty trucks.
Bonanti was responsible for moving the Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication research and agency’s regulations forward as well as co-authored the agency’s original autonomous vehicle policy and guidance for the United States.  He also served as Head of the U.S. Delegation to United Nations World Forum for the Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations.
“The U.S. government is not standing still when it comes to the AV industry,” Bonanti said. “There is an enormous amount of information available on NHTSA’s website. NHTSA’s mission is safety, the reduction of lives lost on America’s highways, and the reduction of costs associated with roadway crashes through education, research and standards. While automobile manufacturers, distributers, retailers, and rental companies are excited about the commercial opportunities, NHTSA’s focus is on how advanced vehicle technologies change the way we drive to save lives and prevent injuries.” 
The NHTSA supports laboratory testing, simulations, and testing on tracks before AVs can be deployed on public roads and sponsor initiatives including the ADS pilot, a preliminary step that seeks public comment on a national pilot research program to help safely test and deploy ADS-equipped vehicles.
“NHTSA’s collaboration with automotive industry leaders and their interactions with the general public is accelerating and streamlining the research and development of safety standards for advanced vehicle safety technologies in a way that could not happen without a non-commercial agency in place,” Bonanti said.
Public and Private Innovation & Collaboration
Bonanti is also a true believer in alliances and consortiums to bring people with passion and ideas together, while also ensuring non-technical issues, like privacy, data protection and security, data integrity and sharing can be hashed out collectively. This extends to privacy issues as well.
“As part of our American principles and values, protecting freedom and personal privacy is fundamental to anything we do,” Bonanti said. “It’s encouraging to see individuals and companies coming together to think through the extraordinary issues associated with connected cars, as the data that will be generated by connected moving vehicles, including contextual and location-based data, will be of great value.”
Bonanti has great respect for the non-profit Auto Alliance, which has collected pledges from 20 automakers  to meet or exceed commitments contained in the Automotive Consumer Privacy Protection Principles established to protect personal information collected through in-car technologies.
“It’s important to provide consumers choices and tools to opt in or opt out of personal information and preference tracking,” Bonanti said. “This is not a black and white issue; many individuals and businesses appreciate the benefits of a high degree of personalization, where systems capture and store preferences, in order to serve up the right information and to literally guide people to the destination on the route of their choice – for example scenic and slow, vs. streamlined and fast. We need to inform people about how we are collecting data, de-identifying it and retaining it and how it will be used and shared.”
Bonanti holds an MBA from the Kellogg School of Business at Northwestern University, which complements his experience in technology and engineering; he is passionate about the positive impact the AV industry can have in terms of job creation and economic development. One area where he sees big opportunities in this regard is the automation of semi-tractor-trailer trucks.
“We’ve all heard stories of drivers pushing the boundaries of hours of service limits, and the accidents, injuries and deaths this has caused,” Bonanti said.  “Automated transportation in the commercial vehicle sector will drive massive competitive advantages for those fleets that can afford to invest or retrofit the technology onto their current fleet. Labor is a high cost for trucking companies, as is insurance on those drivers and fleets. Reduce costs, and shipping gets cheaper. With cheaper shipping, a gallon of milk can cost less. But the over 3 million truckers in the US will need to find new jobs, better jobs over the next decade or two.”
Bonanti believes with public and private partnership and taking this time to really think the consequences through, the U.S. can lead and grow. “Why not train drivers in technology? Why not invest more in innovation now to support those jobs? Look at TuSimple, which has over 50 trucks delivering cargo to and from loading docks in the south. Just last month, they announced an oversubscribed round of Series D investment at $215 million. With strategic investors including UPS, TuSimple achieved unicorn status with a valuation of $1 billion, and the new investment brings TuSimple’s total funding to nearly $300 million.”
Bonanti was intrigued by the Rocket Wagon Venture Studios model, given its benefit of bringing experts in to create IoT innovations, while also enabling studio members to share in equity, either as single company “captive” studios, or as vertical industry studios, with several members participating.
“There are so many challenges to be surfaced and solved,” Bonanti said in summing up. “This is why collaboration is so important, and why public and private partnerships are working. Think about it this way – airplanes have flown more safely on autopilot for decades. That would never have worked without satellites, positioning systems, and the FAA. Planes still have pilots, and many automobiles may always have drivers. But there will come a time when our roads, like our skies, will be much safer, protected from recent threats including distracted driving. This is a sea change worth fighting for, and I couldn’t be more excited to be in the center of this creative and challenging time.”

Autonomous vehicles could soon lead us down the road so efficiently that they reduce traffic gridlock and air pollution while saving lives and money on infrastructure projects.
On the other hand, people could be attracted to riding in self-driving cars more often, making our highways even more crowded. Autonomous vehicles could also generate more trips in the process of driving themselves between dropping people off and their next pick-up. And it should be a major concern that transit systems could lose ridership and put all those people onto the road in autonomous vehicles.
Weighing both sides, there may be two keys to having autonomous vehicles enhance and possibly improve the country’s current flawed transportation network. Without them, AVs stand a good chance of making roads a lot worse.
At TU-Automotive, a major AV conference in Detroit this month, Sam Schwartz, CEO of Gridlock Sam and former traffic commissioner of New York City, noted that vehicle miles traveled decreased between 2003 and 2014 in the United States.
“It wasn’t caused by the recession. It was millennials. They weren’t driving 1 or 2 percent less. They were driving 20 to 25 percent fewer miles. That was extraordinary, and the trend was that driving and parking [for millennials] was a hassle,” said Schwartz, referencing a new report on the younger generation’s transportation preferences. “The majority of 16-year-old millennials were still getting their driver’s licenses during this time, but those doing so went from somewhere in the 90s [percentage-wise] to somewhere in the 70s. It was dramatic. Meanwhile, transit ridership was going up the whole time.”
Those are the kinds of trends needed to keep in place as carmakers add autonomous vehicles to an already-complex mix of cars, trains, subways, bikes, pedestrians, buses, and much more.
The first key: Sharing needs to become a more mainstream behavior
To see VMT stay on that downward trend for millennials, and perhaps creep down for other generations, Schwartz claimed fleet-based autonomous vehicles will be key.
“We could be in a lot of trouble – congestion wise – if people want to own their autonomous vehicles. Most of the studies I’ve seen have shown there will be an increase in VMT if we stay the course.”
Schwartz added, “It gets a bit different with a fleet model. Fleets could keep us from adding lanes and use thinner lanes and could allow us to add things like sidewalks and bike lanes.”
For a fleet model to happen, it’s crucial that automakers get into this new mindset, but equally important for the many carsharing companies step up as well. Kaye Ceille, president of Zipcar, said, “AVs are possibly the biggest of all car technology disruptions. With autonomous cars, cars won’t be parked on the street.”
Ceille added that cities can be transformed by turning all that parking space into green space, parks, and sidewalks. Zipcar is already testing how it would integrate AVs to its fleet and its rental model.
If people broadly embrace a sharing-based model, Dr. Kara Kockelman of the University of Texas estimates that seven of every eight cars can be taken off the highway, with corresponding reductions in demand for parking space.
The assumption that people will let go of personal ownership is a mountain to climb. One study by the University of Leeds predicts that, with autonomous vehicles, VMT will increase by as much as 60 percent because AVs will help productivity rise, reduce the cost of sitting in traffic, and allow people who rarely take a car now to start doing it much more.
And, as Jason Plautz notes in The Atlantic:
A study by the Atlanta Regional Commission predicted that in the year 2040, the number of daily trips and the average trip length will increase due to the better commuting experience. The commission also predicted a decrease in public-transit trips by as much as 42 percent over the baseline in the most extreme projection, which projected total market penetration of autonomous vehicles and myriad benefits, such as reduction in parking cost and lower travel time.
The second key: Prepping cities for AVs
At the Detroit conference, Eric Paul Dennis of the Center for Automotive Research questioned why would should think autonomous cars are the panacea to traffic congestion problems at all. He said there are lots of little common-sense fixes that need to be made before unleashing AVs.
“I Googled ‘smart-city success stories’ and one of the most widely-used technologies I found in smart cities is this thing called [ShotSpotter]. It allows you to put microphones around the city and pinpoint the locations of gunfire, which has become so common in some cities that it doesn’t even get reported,” Dennis said. “These cities have concluded that their city is so violent that it needs [the ShotSpotter]. Why not get a couple of beat cops and a social worker instead?”
His point is well taken in that, in the transportation space, it is common to see agencies choosing the short-term technology patches to long-term holistic thinking about how to make the entire system more effective.
Most of the companies at TU-Detroit were focused on getting the technology right, and they seem determined to give the public AVs whether they want them or not. But another consistent theme was that the problem of traffic can never be solved as long as the entire transportation system is so disjointed.
However, emerging technologies and data can be the connecting pieces that begin to glue it all back together. Susan Zielinski, managing director at the University of Michigan’s SMART project, said, “In every different city, there are different legacies and ecosystems. We have to create open data systems that work across places; local people can customize and personalize it to make it work for them.”
Nathan Potance, vice president of business development at INRIX, replied to her, “We haven’t figured out who the major player is. The uber Uber who controls all the transportation [data].”
Zielinski added, “Technologies can now positively enable cross-sector discussions. It’s really exciting that national and local governments are seeing this as a technology and innovation opportunity rather than just putting transportation in.”
Vijitha Chekuri, senior director of the Internet of Things at Lochbridge said, “If we can get standardization of data set up, then automated vehicles can more easily follow. One way that government can help is to not interfere. All they have to do is let private companies innovate and make smart cities happen.”
For the end game, the public sector and transit have to come along for the ride
And while that all may be mostly pretty wise, there are many issues that cities are better positioned for than the private sector (which, in Detroit, seemed laser focused on making money and refining vehicle performance), including traffic control, pollution, equity, livability, and rulemaking itself.
Transit needs to be a big part of the thinking for becoming an AV society, and that too falls under the public sector’s purview. When you’re going to have more bandwidth of cloud data running into cars than what exists in many homes, how can transit possibly compete with the user experience of autonomous vehicles?
A bright spot is that local transportation departments may finally be trying to out-compete each other with the U.S. DOT’s Smart City Challenge. No matter the winner, that competition needs to continue beyond this particular event. While Atlanta is not a Smart City finalist, Keith Parker, CEO of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, has predicted his agency will be one of the first to “go all-in on autonomous vehicles” as part of the system’s fleet. And simulations in New Jersey support the last-mile complement to transit, finding that AV fleets potentially increase commuter rail ridership by five times its current levels.
Likewise, Kockelman’s University of Texas study found that one self-driving taxi can replace around 10 private cars and boost carpooling. Advocates say the cars will be able to drive more closely together, as well as avoid the accidents that can snarl traffic for miles.
When asked at the Detroit conference whether AVs are part of the solution, Xavier Mosquet of Boston Consulting Group said, “With two people in a driverless cab, it could be the same price point as mass transit. It becomes affordable. You could then replace a lot of owned vehicles. And it’s a tremendous benefit if [AVs] are used for a last-mile solution.”
If AVs can come to market following these models, as carsharing and transit partners work to shift cultural preferences about ownership, it’s certainly possible that the new technologies will begin to create more efficiently flowing highways and streets.

262,"
Mobility as a Service (MaaS) represents a new way of thinking about about transport. It has the potential to be the most significant innovation in transport since the advent of the automobile.
In a move away from dependence on privately owned cars or multiple transport apps, MaaS combines mobility services from public transport, taxis, car rental and car/bicycle sharing under a single platform that’s accessible from a smart phone. Not only will a MaaS platform plan your journey, it will also allow you to buy tickets from a range of service providers.
While autonomous vehicles have garnered much of the recent media attention on transport, MaaS is gaining ground. A Google search now returns more than 400,000 hits on “mobility as a service”. Many private and public transport providers, along with many state governments, are looking at the impacts of MaaS and how they can capitalise on the idea.
Why the growing interest in MaaS?
In part, the motivation is due to changing demographics. The world continues to urbanise with 55% of the global population living in urban areas today. By 2050, projections suggest that will increase to 68%. This increasing urbanisation will add to existing problems of traffic congestion.
A growing body of evidence suggests that providing more infrastructure won’t solve the problem. It’s too costly and this type of “solution” will provide only temporary relief. MaaS has been promoted as a better way to manage traffic congestion by making more efficient use of existing private and public transport infrastructure.
And MaaS has many other appealing aspects. It could shorten commuting times and make travelling more convenient. It could help shift commuter trips from peak times to low demand times (through demand-responsive pricing of the services).
Finally, MaaS could improve air quality by shifting travellers from cars to more sustainable modes, such as public and active transport, through reward systems. For example, in a trial in Gothenburg, customers were rewarded with points for every ton of CO2 emissions they avoided by using more sustainable travel modes. The points were redeemable for a range of goods and services.
The other motivating factor is the estimated value of the MaaS market. Projections suggest a market worth $US600 billion in the United States, European Union and China by 2025. Others have projected that the global market for MaaS will exceed $US1 trillion by 2030.
Lessons from early trials
UbiGo first trialled MaaS in Gothenburg, Sweden, for six months between November 2013 and April 2014. This involved 83 subscriptions by 195 people.
Most of the customers (80%) wanted to continue after the trial ended. Based on an evaluation of the Gothenburg trial, the following were important considerations for MaaS:
competitive cost relative to owning a carflexibility and conveniencesufficient mobility infrastructure to reach most potential usersease of use.
The first commercial application of the concept was by MaaS Global in Helsinki, Finland. The Whim app was launched in 2016. It covers public transport, taxis, car rentals, car-share and bike-share modes. Customers can use the service on a pay-as-you-go plan or by monthly subscription.
Governance the key to scaling up MaaS
MaaS Global is looking to expand elsewhere soon. The key question is whether it can work beyond Helsinki. The challenge is not about the technology — it is about governance.
It’s no coincidence that Whim was born in Finland, a small country with well-functioning institutions and well-designed cities. MaaS will continue to be successful here, in part due to support from the national government.
For example, in 2018 Finland was the first country in the world to create an open market for mobility services. As of January 2018, all mobility partners must provide open data and associated computer programs (APIs) to third parties.
By contrast, the Gothenburg trial, while successful, has not yet resulted in regular services. Based on learnings from the trial, UbiGo has refined their business model to better integrate public and commercial transport services and will be relaunching in Stockholm with a trial followed by a full roll-out by the end of 2018.
MaaS requires a willingness by private and public transport providers to work with the creators of MaaS platforms. Transport providers must agree to allow the MaaS operator to sell their services and collect a “reasonable” and “fair” commission for each ticket sold.
Another challenge is getting private operators to participate despite losing customers in the short term.
Advocates suggest that, if the concept is successful, the pool of customers will grow as cars are abandoned in favour of MaaS. Hence most companies will want to participate in one or more MaaS platforms.
However, for its potential to be realised, MaaS needs governments to ensure a playing field that is fair for existing and new mobility service providers, and one that encourages cooperation rather than competition. It may be the case that the most efficient MaaS platforms will take the form of regulated monopolies, much like existing utility companies.

These developments will be green and user-friendly, but the use of AI in their creation and operation worries some
 By RINA CHANDRAN 
Chinese tech giant Tencent is creating a “smart city” that utilises technology to put people and the environment first, a model that could be applied to other urban developments after the coronavirus, the project’s architect said on Wednesday.
Net City will be a 2-million square metre neighbourhood in the southeastern city of Shenzhen, comprising Tencent offices and residences for its employees, as well as public amenities such as parks and a waterfront area.
Naspers has a 31.2% stake in Tencent.
With fewer streets for cars, “green” garden roofs on buildings and the use of artificial intelligence (AI), Net City is a model for the “future of city building”, said Jonathan Ward, a design partner at NBBJ, a US-based architecture firm.
“This moment reinforces the need to think about designing spaces, buildings and cities that are restorative … plentiful indoor-outdoor spaces that are good for overall human health, perhaps even more so during a pandemic,” Ward said.
Construction of Net City is scheduled to begin later this year.
It will prioritise sustainability by “reducing car use, increasing planning strategies around the needs of people, allowing greater public access, and with increased environmental conservation”, Ward said.
More than 500 smart cities are being built across China, according to government data, equipped with sensors, cameras, and other gadgets that can crunch data on everything from traffic and pollution, to public health and security.
Net City will use technologies such AI and autonomous vehicles, said Ward. Mangroves and other nature-based features will help mitigate the impacts of climate change.
Smart cities are a part of China’s plan to spur growth amid a global economic downturn, authorities said in March. But the use of technologies such as AI in China and elsewhere have also raised concerns about data privacy and surveillance, including during the pandemic.
Last month, Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs canned its Toronto smart city project that had envisioned sensors feeding data to AI-enabled computers to manage traffic and drainage systems. Alphabet is the parent company of Google.
The project had long faced opposition over issues including data privacy and the influence of big technology companies in city planning.
However, in China, where smart cities rely on the government’s dominant role in urban planning and budgeting, the general public has less say, said Xu Chengwei, a public-policy researcher at the Singapore Management University.
“China’s smart city initiatives are not driven primarily by market demand, but by political and technological ambition,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Smart cities will continue to be the core of city planning, and tech giants’ involvement will continue,” he said.
In China and elsewhere, given the need to track and monitor the coronavirus pandemic, technology will not be “any less ubiquitous or any more democratised”, said Kris Hartley, an assistant professor at the Education University of Hong Kong.
“The narrative around Covid-19 recovery and resilience is likely to be shaped around urbanism in some way. So there may well be an increase in purpose-built towns as demonstration projects or test-bed experiments,” he said. “Technology will shape the post-coronavirus world.”

Technology can help to manage supply and demand more effectively; to avoid queues and overcrowding, says Royal HaskoningDHV South Africa strategic transport and planning business development manager Gideon Treurnich.ADVERTISEMENT
Using mobile phone WiFi signals, smart cameras and open-source data, city planners and transport managers can assess the level of crowding and, when necessary, re-route pedestrians or vehicles away from these areas, he explains.
With smartphone penetration escalating each year, it is plausible to use this to give transporters the power to anticipate load and manage capacity, while empowering commuters to be certain of their position on a particular mode of transport, reducing time spent in queues and sparing all parties from exposure to the virus through overcrowding.ADVERTISEMENT
“This evolution in transport management is part of mobility as a service (Maas) and also gives service providers the security of being able to anticipate their income, while passengers can be confident that they will be able to complete their trip as planned,” he says.
Such a platform would be of value to the minibus taxi industry, which would allow vehicle owners to know where their vehicles are and how they are being used, via a dashboard on the mobile device of their choice.
This would help them manage which vehicles were sent to which ranks and to meet specific levels of demand at different times of the day, making it possible to balance drivers’ opportunities to earn with passenger demand and avoid queues during peak hours and crowding at parking areas in down times.
Work has already been completed on a pilot project along these lines, working with a taxi association in Durban. Taxis were fitted with trackers and communication devices as part of an integrated transport plan for the city, helping manage traffic, and demand for vehicles, Treurnich adds.
“Royal HaskoningDHV‘s human-centric design harnesses data to organise space and processes to adapt to the changing needs of pedestrians and commuters, while complying with the policies set by each city. This allows continued access to public spaces, improved safety, enhanced comfort and better control of populations on the go,” he says.
“While other steps and procedures, like personal disinfection, ongoing vehicle cleaning and sterilisation, and open windows to allow the free flow of air will be essential to ensuring safe transport, using technology and harnessing the potential of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the best way to get South Africans moving again – safely, efficiently, and cost-effectively.”
Bus or train operators can also optimise their fleets, managing a rotation of vehicles off the grid for sanitising or servicing at any time, without impacting commuters’ ability to get to where they need to be – on time.
“Cities across the world are planning or taking measures to ensure that 1.5 metre distancing guidelines are met so that people can move around in a comfortable and safe way. The key to achieving this in limited public space – like in South Africa’s taxi ranks – lies in the ability to have an ongoing and real-time view of how busy hotspots are so that appropriate steps can be taken when an area gets too busy,” he says.
This can be achieved through crowd management systems, which aim to optimise the flows of people and support mobility as a service.
“While State of Disaster regulations stipulate that minibus taxis can only carry 70% of their legal load, and that passengers must sanitise their hands on entering in addition to wearing masks, this lesser load is only plausible while only sections of the workforce have returned to work.
“How will the sector balance safety and profitability once the majority of lockdown conditions are relaxed? The key to an effective approach lies in connecting data infrastructure throughout the passenger journey by creating and embracing data platforms that enable interoperability,” concludes Treurnich

 Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley analysts told their clients that Morgan Stanley had grossly underestimated its previous valuation of Google’s driverless car division, Waymo.
“Our previous work has shown how Waymo’s autonomous robotaxi taxi business could be worth (approximately) $75 billion,” a team of analysts led by Brian Nowak noted to investors. “But that is likely just the beginning, as there are two other business models — logistics/delivery and licensing — now coming into view … which we see leading to a total (approximately) $175 billion potential Waymo valuation.”
The $175 billion valuation puts Waymo ahead of GM, Ford and Tesla combined.
In Vail, the Town Council wants to make a priority of thoughtful and thorough discussion of emerging technologies. As reports were coming out about Morgan Stanley’s valuation on Tuesday, Aug. 7, the council listened to a presentation from Rutt Bridges, author of “Our Driverless Future: Heaven or Hell?”
Bridges made some predictions that will affect the United States as a whole, but also localized his presentation to Vail a bit, with insights as to how driverless cars might help affordable housing, cost of living and traffic on Interstate 70.
CAR-TO-CAR COMMUNICATION
Our area will not be among the first to see the driverless car revolution take place. Areas such as Phoenix, San Fransisco and Atlanta have both the predictable weather and high concentrations of people to help reduce the variables in this new experiment.
But while cold and slippery conditions will complicate the driverless scene, it will also offer a chance for companies to employ the car-to-car communication technology that could make these cars so revolutionary, Bridges told the council.
Recounting a conversation he had with a vice president from Volvo, Bridges told the Vail Town Council that a cloud-based “ice map” might make things safer in areas such as ours.
“Whenever their tires slip a little, they’re mapping the areas that are icy, and they’re creating a map in the cloud, so you know where those icy patches are,” Bridges said. “These cars will automatically slow down as they get near them. If that data is shared with everyone, as cars get smarter and smarter, other cars will be able to do that, too.”
Another car-to-car communication breakthrough that could reduce headaches in our area is the idea of vehicles doing something Bridges calls “platooning,” where lines of cars headed in the same direction tailgate one another with very little space between.
“They travel like a school of fish,” Bridges said. “Because these vehicles are all connected electronically by radio waves, when the front vehicle slows down or speeds up, every other one does within a thousandth of a second … you can get the equivalent use of five conventional lanes, if you platoon.”
Bridges sees I-70 as a highway where platooning could reduce traffic immensely.
“I believe this is coming, but there’s a lot more research that needs to be done before it’s really delivered,” he said.
REDUCED COST OF LIVING
Based on projections going out to the year 2027, buying miles from mobility services and ride-share programs currently costs between one fourth and one eighth of what it costs to own a sedan, Bridges estimates.
“The lower your income is, the bigger a difference that makes in your life,” Bridges told the Vail Town Council.
In areas where more housing is being constructed, if parking isn’t taking up a large amount of real estate that could be used for additional units, it’s being done in a way that’s extremely expensive through the use of multi-level parking structures.
“The average parking ratios for a two-bedroom apartment is about 1 1/2 parking spaces,” Bridges said. “A little over half the space that you actually use for the apartment.”
With mobility on demand, cars won’t use conventional parking spaces.
“You park them nose to nose, one behind the other like a Pez dispenser,” Bridges said. “When one is needed, the one in the front pulls off and everybody else moves up.”
Bridges estimates the cost of rent dropping by as much as $375 per month over the course of the next decade if the need for parking is dramatically reduced through the advent of mobility-on-demand and ride-share services.
“The average American car spends 95 percent of its life in park,” he said.

Catching up with the man himself, just a few months into his new role, we discussed why he returned to Avis Budget Group, the impact of ride-sharing apps on traditional car rental, the future of mobility and a whole lot more…
 
TD: You have had a long history with Avis Budget Group, going back to 1998, and had experience in key roles — what brings you back to Avis Budget Group? 
Keith Rankin (KR): My background with the company has given me the opportunity to experience different areas of the business first-hand, and I am delighted to be back at a time when we are experiencing one of the most significant shifts in the mobility landscape around the world.

“We are in a great position to lead this mobility revolution”

My most recent position was the chief executive for the automotive division at Barloworld in South Africa, which is a licensee partner of Avis Budget Group. However, my journey with the company started over 20 years ago, in 1998 within the financial planning department.
I believe we are in a great position to lead this mobility revolution and become one of the leading voices shaping the future of mobility.
TD: How has the company changed in the time that you were away?
KR: Avis Budget Group has been constantly innovating and evolving to meet the new expectations of its customers.
It has formed a range of new partnerships and developed its services to ensure that it remains at the forefront and delivers mobility services to the high standard its customers expect. The Group has been building new platforms, developing technologies and capabilities to further revolutionise the rental experience, and evolving our business to meet the present and future needs of our customers. 
TD: How have ride-sharing apps like Uber, and specifically in Asia, Grab – affected Avis Budget Group?
KR: For our core business, our average rental globally is four days and 450 miles. These distances and timeframes are different from what a ride-sharing customer is looking for. Therefore, I would say there is a different need, customer and opportunity for traditional car rental and ride-sharing apps. However, ride-sharing apps like Uber and Grab do highlight how consumers are increasingly viewing transport as an on-demand and personalised service. This is consistent with what we see as the future of mobility, namely a fully integrated, connected, on-demand and personalised mobility landscape.

“The future of mobility is dependent on a fully connected travel ecosystem”

A recent report from Avis Budget Group ‘The Road Ahead: The Future of Mobility’, revealed 82% of consumers across 16 markets in Europe and Asia said owning a car is still important, but more than half (54%) are prepared to give up car ownership and rely on on-demand, long-term rental subscription services within the next decade. 
When looking at this trend in Asia, it’s interesting to see the uptake of Zipcar, the world’s leading car-sharing network that is owned and operated by Avis Budget Group. In Taiwan, Zipcar currently has 10,000 members with approximately 100 cars in the fleet to provide convenience to our customers. This demonstrates the change in consumer mobility behaviours as drivers become open to using alternative mobility services to access a vehicle.
Furthermore, the report highlights the importance of mobility partnerships to improve the overall travel experience. The future of mobility is dependent on a fully connected travel ecosystem where different modes of transport work together to provide a streamlined and on-demand service. We are already demonstrating the success of this, for example in America we have partnered with Lyft, the fastest-growing ride-sharing company.
TD: You are responsible for Europe, the Middle East, Africa (EMEA), Asia, Australia and New Zealand. How important is Asia to the global success of Avis Budget Group?
KR: Asia remains a key part of Avis Budget Group’s global success, and we are currently present in over 20 Asian markets. The car rental market in this region is expected to grow exponentially in the next five years as levels of disposable income continue to increase, as well as the number of people obtaining driving licenses. For instance, in 2018 nearly 370 million people in China held a driver’s license.
TD: How does the Asian market differ from the rest of the world?
KR: Avis Budget Group is present in more than 11,000 locations and over 180 countries around the world, we do not believe in a one-size-fits-all approach, but instead combine a sense of consistency for our customers, with individual market needs. The Asian markets are nuanced, and the trends for customer groups in each market are diverse. To ensure we are meeting these trends effectively, we work closely with local businesses in the Asian markets to demonstrate our commitment to shaping the mobility industry.

“Technology, and the future of mobility, is where the real opportunity lies for us”

For the region as a whole, there is a lot of potential for growth and, given our successful track record in the mobility industry, Avis Budget Group is well-positioned to continue building on our momentum and drive growth for years to come.
TD: The travel industry (in fact most industries) has an obsession with digitalisation, what does this do for Avis Budget Group and how will benefit the customer?
KR: Technology, and the future of mobility, is where the real opportunity lies for us. We have a global fleet which we are working towards fully connecting. This will allow us to provide a data-driven intelligent mobility service meeting the mobility needs of both individuals and businesses. 
Our access to technology and data has allowed us to acquire deep expertise in global fleet management, and having a connected fleet means that critical data such as mileage, fuel level, and vehicle condition can be shared in real-time. This results in better-maintained vehicles and overall better customer experience. Through digital innovation, from connected cars to cloud-based platforms and mobile apps, we have been continually reinventing the rental experience.
TD: What other trends do you think will impact car rentals in Asia over the next few years?
KR: Asia Pacific destinations such as Australia, New Zealand and Japan are becoming increasingly popular as road trip destinations by Asian travellers and travellers around the world. As more people choose to go on self-drive holidays in Asia to discover hidden gems by car, and as more people access their driving licenses, we can expect demand for car rental in Asia to increase as well.

“It is critical that we are constantly innovating”

Undertourism or less-frequented destinations is another trend that might potentially increase the demand for car rental in Asia. As awareness of overtourism increases, more travellers are seeking undiscovered and eco-friendly destinations for their holidays. As such places tend to lack a well-developed public transport system, cars would be the most convenient mode of transport, indirectly increasing the demand for car rental.
TD: Avis Budget Group has a record of forging practical but forward-thinking partnerships, such as Amazon and Arrive – what impact have these relationships have on the business and how important are they to the company’s future?
KR: As the first car rental company to host its platform on Amazon Web Services, Avis Budget Group has demonstrated its commitment to revolutionise and lead the way in the future of mobility. With the rapid pace of technological advancements, it is critical that we are constantly innovating and forging forward-thinking partnerships that will help us to be a step ahead of competitors.

“We are always on a lookout for new partnerships”

Our partnerships are just the start of the future of mobility and they demonstrate how industry specialists need to work together to provide the best mobility services for consumers. We are proud to be leading the way in showcasing the success and importance of all travel services working together. We are excited about what the future holds for new and current partnerships.
TD: What partnerships have you made in this part of the world and what are you looking for in a partner?
KR: Avis Budget Group for the Asia region has been focusing on outbound self-drive holidays from Asia to the world for both the Avis and Budget brands. This is due to a growing demand for self-drive holidays among Asian travellers looking for new and unique travel experiences to undiscovered and lesser-known locations by road.
In 2019, Avis partnered with Mediterranean Luxe on a tourism campaign for the second year running to inspire Asian travellers to explore some of Mediterranean Europe’s most scenic spots by road, covering France, Monaco, Spain, Catalonia and Croatia.

“There is a thirst… to deliver more on-demand, connected and personalised mobility solutions”

Partnerships with travel and mobility service providers are an important part of our business and we are always on a lookout for new partnerships to improve the overall travel experience for our customers. We believe that all travel and transport services must become fully integrated and connected, whether this is a new or existing service, to ensure the industry is meeting the requirements of its customers.
TD: What excites you most about the future of Avis Budget Group?
KR: For today and the future, the shifting mobility landscape is our biggest and most exciting opportunity.
The technology revolution, coupled with changing consumer needs, means there is a thirst and opportunity to deliver more on-demand, connected and personalised mobility solutions to businesses and consumers. With this opportunity, there is a need to innovate existing services and be willing to take risks to move forward. With over 70 years’ experience and 11,000 locations around the world, Avis Budget Group is in a great position to not only be part of this mobility revolution – but also to help lead the way.

 Leading transport consultant believes more must be done to encourage people onto public transport 
 By Gavin Gibbon 
Dubai needs to improve its first and last mile transport options in order to encourage people out of their cars and enhance the emirate’s status as a smart city, according to a leading mobility expert.
Scott Fennelly, director of transportation and ITS Services at Surface Mobility Consultants, was speaking at a webinar organised by international real estate outfit Savills, looking at transport and innovations and whether real estate in the Middle East is future-proof to technological changes in transport.
Fennelly said that while the UAE and Saudi Arabia are leading the way in terms of the adoption of autonomous vehicles and self-drive transport, Dubai, in particular, is lagging behind cities such as London and Singapore when it comes to providing mobility as a service.
While Dubai boasts hugely popular metro and tram systems, he pointed out that the links between these need to be improved.
He said: “The extension of the metro line here in Dubai, that requires further work in the first and last mile areas. Other regions do a lot better on the first and last mile, with cycle schemes and e-scooters. Unfortunately the infrastructure needs to be developed more in a planning perspective and on an urban design.
“I myself wouldn’t cycle many roads in Dubai, but that needs to be increased substantially to be able to have those first-mile links. And how that interacts with infrastructure and development is really to look at the infrastructure to have the facilities that if somebody wants to cycle to work, they can maybe shower. The heat here in Dubai and the UAE, KSA will put you off cycling.”
In March 2014, Sheikh Mohammed launched the strategy to transform Dubai into a ‘smart city’, which features six key pillars and 100 initiatives on transport, communications, infrastructure, electricity, economic services, urban planning.
“You have Dubai which is a smart city and it has implemented a number of intelligent transport systems or smart mobility systems within the city as a whole, but it needs to increase on existing infrastructure,” said Fennelly.
Smart solutions are already being incorporated into new developments, while work has begun to link up with transportation networks, an example being the launch last year of bicycles for hire from Careem, which are available in various spots across the city.
However, Fennelly stressed more must be done if citizens and residents are to give up their cars and switch to public transport instead.
He said: “It’s that first and last mile that stops us getting public transport because we don’t want to be walking in the heat.”

In my conversations with members of the HPC community worldwide, I’m constantly inspired by new, novel HPC applications, including the need for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and high-performance data analytics to run the most complex workloads and process the mass amounts of data. These examples reemphasize the need for serious computing capabilities for modern and future AI/HPC applications that can harness this wealth of data to address societal issues. This is particularly clear in the case of Internet of Things (IoT) enabled smart cities, which could derive major benefit from HPC and HPC-like capabilities.
Data Opportunities and Challenges
I recently spoke with my colleague Sameer Sharma, Intel’s Global General Manager for IoT (New Markets, Smart Cities, and Intelligent Transportation), about his organization’s efforts to enable the future of smart cities — those which are incorporating insights derived from IoT devices and other sensors into the governance of shared spaces such as roads, waterways, airports, seaports, sporting venues, and universities. To guide their work, Sameer’s team took a step back and talked to people around the globe about challenges for urban life. Three key areas emerged:
Safety—People want to be safe and also feel safe.Mobility—People need to get from point A to point B expediently and efficiently.Sustainability—People want to manage the city’s environmental impact.
Sameer’s team worked with Harbor Research, a well-known research firm in the smart cities space, to better understand the data generation aspects of smart cities—in other words, what data is generated and how it is generated. The results were staggering. The analysis found that smart cities will produce a total of approximately 16.5 zettabytes of data in 2020 alone. To put this in context, a zettabyte is one trillion gigabytes, or roughly as many gigabytes of data as 11oz cups of coffee would fit in The Great Wall of China.
While each individual city’s data footprint depends on the unique mix of smart applications deployed, you could guess that each smart city still has a lot of data to contend with. In the future, many cities may turn to AI algorithms to tap into this data to manage city operations. However, the scale of the data and need for rapid insights will make HPC-level computing resources a requirement to make the most of this opportunity.
Federated Data Platforms for Urban Mobility and Safety
Projects throughout the world are revealing the potential of integrating highly-capable compute into urban spaces. In one example, the city of Bangkok, Thailand, installed smart cameras in three traffic intersections. Real-time tracking algorithms fed by these cameras and run atop Intel® Core™ processor based systems optimized traffic signal timing to improve traffic flow. This solution reduced queue length in these intersections by 30.5%, saving more than 50,000 vehicle commuter hours.
However, the value of the data from cameras like these shouldn’t end at the individual intersection. Results from the edge could be used to optimize traffic at the macro level as well. City-level traffic analysis via deep learning algorithms would require a more capable converged AI/HPC system in a data center, but could have big benefits to commuter safety and mobility, as well as city planning. The more cameras and sensors involved, the greater the potential, but also the greater the need for HPC resources for analysis.
In another example, the city of Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, deployed 1,800 HD video cameras to ensure the safety of the estimated 500,000 people visiting for the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. This solution used Intel Atom® and Intel Core processors for analysis at the edge and a higher-performance Intel® Xeon® processor based system for further analysis in the data center.
This system processed about 1.5 million pieces of video data each day to help staff detect and respond to abandoned objects and prevent unauthorized access to off-limits areas. Sameer noted in our conversation that similar systems deployed today can use energy-efficient purpose-built AI accelerators like the Intel® Movidius™ Myriad™ X Visual Processing Unit (VPU) for analysis at the edge that just a few years ago would have required analysis in a traditional data center. 
Additionally, today’s HPC systems benefit from 2nd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors with built-in AI acceleration (Intel® Deep Learning Boost). The HPC capabilities of Intel architecture become all the more important as the number of IoT sensors scales up, increasing the overhead of data analysis. Future HPC deployments will enable new opportunities for converged AI/HPC applications to derive maximum value from data like those in Rio De Jeneiro’s solution.
A Future of Widespread Smart Cities and Transportation
The market and demand for HPC capabilities continues to expand as more organizations turn towards AI/HPC converged solutions to turn data into social benefit. With more than 1,100 cities with population greater than 500,000 people worldwide in 2018 and many thousand more with population greater than 100,000 IoT-enabled smart cities could be a big new user group for HPC in the near future.
IoT’s drive for HPC compute doesn’t stop there. Industrial and healthcare IoT systems, to name just two other verticals, will also generate huge amounts of data and thus demand for compute to analyze that data. It is an exciting time for those of us at Intel continuing to work to enable a diversifying customer base.

 The COVID-19 pandemic could be the catalyst for widespread adoption 
By  Craig Guillot NRF Contributor 

As consumers demand more convenient fulfillment while technology improves and costs fall, the prospect for autonomous delivery is growing. The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic could create a perfect storm of factors that finally make things like drones and delivery robots ripe for adoption.
“The pandemic has increased the viability of autonomous delivery,” says Michael Ramsey, vice president and analyst who covers the automotive industry and smart mobility at Gartner. “It’s one more box that they can check for in saying ‘this makes sense.’”
No one is certain what the “new normal” will look like, but many agree that greater social distancing could be a part of our future. Fewer people in stores, more use of online ordering and the desire to increase contactless fulfillment will increase the viability of autonomous robots. While many retailers have been looking to robots to address what they see as a temporary issue, many analysts believe long-term behavioral changes in consumers could make autonomous delivery a permanent fixture in the retail world.
Retail use cases
A recent report by Research and Markets found the global autonomous last-mile delivery industry is projected to grow to $76 billion by 2030, due to technological advancements in delivery vehicles and the surging demand for fast delivery.
Many large retailers are testing some form of autonomous delivery. Walmart and The Kroger Co. are both testing the Nuro self-driving robot to deliver groceries. The compact vehicle operates like a small, driverless car with four cargo holds and can transport everything from groceries and food to retail products and dry cleaning.
Retailers are testing drones and aerial robots as well. Walgreens announced last fall it was testing on-demand delivery service with Alphabet’s drone concept Wing in Christiansburg, Va. The retailer could be well-positioned to use drone delivery service because nearly 80 percent of the U.S. population lives within five miles of a Walgreens, the same range of Wing’s drone.
CVS, with UPS, plans to begin offering prescription drug delivery via drone to a retirement community in Florida. UPS also announced a partnership with drone startup Wingcopter to develop a new fleet of drones that could transport a variety of goods over long distances. And, in late March, Amazon hired a former Boeing executive to manage the Prime Air drone business, a sign many analysts take as a big step toward making the idea a reality.
“Autonomous delivery technology is rapidly developing,” says Gary Silberg, partner and head of automotive at KPMG. “Many of these technologies use underlying deep learning software and lidar, radar, cameras, ultrasonic and sensor fusion to gather data, know where they are going and when to turn left, right or stop. They’re getting better and smarter.”
As the technologies and AI algorithms have been improving, costs have been declining, Silberg says. For example, while lidar units used to cost $85,000, they can now be found for well under $10,000. As that trend continues, the return on investment is growing more attractive, especially for retailers such as grocers where continuous and repetitive deliveries could help them achieve economies of scale on their investments.
“If you are delivering the same groceries day after day and the number of these routes, you can amortize all these costs over a vehicle and it can become profitable,” Silbert says.
No-contact fulfillment
The COVID-19 pandemic could more quickly lead the retail industry to autonomous deliveries. Due to stay-at-home restrictions, consumers increased their use of online and delivery channels in March and April 2020. Many retailers like Best Buy and Target have expanded curbside pickup features that enable consumers to order and retrieve purchases without exiting their vehicles. The trends are all paving the way for fulfillment concepts that distance humans from the equation.
“It’s a massive area and massive economic opportunity,” Silberg says. “COVID-19 has just accelerated it.”
Chinese ecommerce giant JD is also exploring the potential to expand drone deliveries in the wake of the pandemic. The company said in a blog post that its drones have played an important role in the fight against the virus, delivering necessities to Chinese consumers and helping several major cities provide protective measures. JD noted that drones and autonomous delivery robots cannot only drive results without the risk of human contact but also help enterprises improve efficiency and reduce cost.
Starship Technologies, which offers small robot delivery services in more than 100 cities around the world, has seen a large rise in demand since the pandemic started, says Vice President of Marketing Henry Harris-Burland. While the robots were a convenience for many retailers and consumers, they have now become a necessity in many neighborhoods.
Since its founding in 2014, the vehicles have made over 100,000 deliveries. “Many people now don’t even have many options to get groceries right now. They’re self-isolating and can’t go out if they’re vulnerable, elderly or have health conditions,” Harris-Burland says. “We’re proud we can be part of the solution providing contactless delivery to people.”
Long-term behavioral changes
Despite the promise of new deployments and further adoption of autonomous delivery vehicles, challenges remain. While most states have put in place some kind of regulations to test autonomous vehicles, few have formalized regulations for widespread deployment in real-world applications, making it difficult for the technologies to be rolled out nationwide.
“There are no federal guidelines, so each state has been making their own rules, which creates a lot of ambiguity and cost,” Silberg says. “I think we ultimately need at least some level of regulation or guidelines on that, but the devil is in the details.”
Ramsey notes there are still ROI issues with many small delivery vehicles; the presumption is they cannot move as quickly as humans, nor can they always deal with things like uneven sidewalks, obstructions or odd entrances to doorsteps or apartments. A bigger issue is that many robots in use still require consumers to physically retrieve deliveries. So, while grocery and small food deliveries can work now, there remains a big gap in how many other deliveries can be made, especially when the person isn’t at home. “How do we solve the last 50 feet of delivery? They’re in sort of this middle area,” Ramsey says.
More promising applications are in the “middle mile” where the autonomous technology works hand-in-hand with a human, Ramsey says. The United States Postal Service has investigated whether its next generation vehicles might employ this kind of technology, where the vehicle drives around and the person jumps out and makes deliveries. As the need for such services grow, companies are trying to refine how these robots work in the real world and how they can overcome remaining obstacles, address regulations and make the ROI work.
Looking at health care, where some robots are already being deployed in hospitals and might soon be used to provide COVID-19 tests, could provide some guidance. “The COVIC pandemic actually adds a new purpose to the autonomous which hadn’t been there before,” Ramsey says, “and it actually might give us some reason to move forward.”

Transit system operators were already thinking about making at least a partial switch to contactless payments long before a global pandemic disrupted any and every element of how people moved between Point A and Point B.
Mary Kay Bowman, Visa’s global head of buyer and seller solutions, told Karen Webster in a recent conversation that some operators had contactless payments already partially available in segments of the public transportation system, while others had it earmarked for a project several years in the future. But overall, there was a collective consensus on the part of transit operators worldwide that tap to pay was essential to making the daily commute easier and more convenient.
Then a funny thing happened in late February/early March. The global pandemic moved contactless up the priority list — with an additional incentive to accelerate systems’ plans.
Transit operators now view contactless payments as a way to align their operations to make the post-pandemic experience on public transportation not only convenient but safer. Bowman said that what she hears now from operators is: “We need to do this now.”
“Transit systems took this as an opportunity to say: ‘We cannot slow down, these are essential services,’” Bowman said. “They saw that their work servicing the essential workers made them essential as well —  and that they have to be part of the recovery.”
She said transit operators aren’t only thinking about contactless as it relates to their piece of the consumer’s transit journey, but rather across the customer’s entire journey away and then back home.
Making any part of the journey safe, Bowman told Webster, means making every part of it safe — from the trains to the buses to the subway systems and beyond. It also means modernizing the transportation-payment ecosystem’s entire infrastructure, a project that transit operators are increasingly committed to.
Visa’s announced Thursday (July 16) an expansion in its efforts with Cubic Transportation Systems to not only accelerate contactless deployments but create infrastructure to grow, scale and make systems interoperable across an entire public-transportation journey. That will build on work the company is already doing with more than 500 transit authorities around the world.
“We wanted to do something that is more standard [and] a little more scalable so that transit operators don’t have to build their own customized solutions,” Bowman said.
Why Contactless Payments Are The First Part Of That Journey
The general surge in contactless payments since coronavirus isn’t surprising, as COVID-wary consumers would prefer not to physically interact with anything that others have also touched. But the advantages of touchless when it comes to transit go much, much deeper, Bowman said.
“Contactless also means there are fewer queues at the ticketing terminal,” she said. “There aren’t as many people in the line swiping to get in, because it’s faster. There are actually a whole collection of benefits that come with touchless. [It] creates a multiplying effect.”
Consider a pilot program Visa is currently working on to create a contactless-transit program in Central  California. Working in conjunction with the California Department of Transportation, Visa aims to make bus operator Monterey-Salinas Transit the first California transit agency to have contactless payments. More broadly, the project aims to establish a solution and set of contactless standards that can scale to create consistency across hundreds of Golden State transit agencies as part of the California Integrated Travel Project.
“In the world of the mass-transit transaction models, [there] weren’t really standards before now,” Bowman said. “We took it as a high priority to create a standard model, something that we’re very good at — standards and practices, interoperability and ubiquity. Those are all key to the Visa network, and what transit payments need.”
Bowman said she hopes such a template will help other transit authorities that want to do the same thing do so in a much more efficient, faster way.
A Remaking Picking Up Speed 
While the future isn’t easy to predict these days, the transformation of transit payments toward contactless systems is gaining speed worldwide. Bowman said that’s partly because many transit operators know and regularly interact with each other. As more and more systems add contactless options, operators are looking to one another and feeling inspired to move forward.
Bowman said Visa’s partnership with Cubic is an important piece of building that momentum. Together, the two firms are integrating payments with a rigorously standardized operating procedure compatible with transit systems worldwide. For operators, that means making contactless payments seamless, familiar and scalable.
“Operators have been committed to protecting the safety of their riders and employees — and we want to be critical in helping that effort,” Bowman said.

Cities are constantly looking to improve the quality of life for their citizens. New mobility (technology-enabled, on-demand and shared transportation options) has the potential to help cities reduce both carbon emissions and traffic congestion, thus improving the livability of cities.
However, without the right smart city planning in place, new mobility could just as easily have the polar opposite effect, increasing carbon emissions and traffic.
The right strategy touches on all aspects of public policy, which is, in and of itself, a significant hurdle for cities hoping to improve livability through new mobility.
While working with cities like Hannover, Almere, Varberg and Rotterdam, it became clear that there are two prevailing success factors in the process:

The first is a high-quality public-private collaboration so that the private market can effectively implement new mobility modes.
Secondly, a solid understanding of the cascading impacts of new mobility deployment with accompanying city policy is crucial. It can guide deployment to help achieve community goals and ensure future-proof investments for public authorities.

Luckily, there are already several successful examples of such collaborations in the US from which European cities can learn. As it stands, the first implementations are happening in cities all over the world.
But without the right smart city planning in place, European cities are finding it difficult to manage their role as both incubator and regulator. Without the proper parameters, even the most promising mobility initiatives can fail before they even have a chance to get off the ground.
Recent examples in Amsterdam and Paris showed potential drawbacks of the open market for private undocked shared bike or electric scooter companies. The open market access increased pressure on public spaces and bike-sharing companies to be cost-competitive, leading to several bankrupt companies abandoning bikes throughout the city and ultimately the cities closing free market access for new players by introducing a permit-based system.
Interacting With Private Solution Providers
Many of the concepts (from e-scooters to shared mopeds) being tested in cities across Europe certainly have a lot of potential, but they also leave policymakers facing new challenges when it comes to guaranteeing low costs, road safety and distribution of liabilities and responsibilities.
This is especially true for the interaction with private solution providers as the private market is able to be nimbler, test models more quickly, take more risk and more effectively implement mobility solutions than cities. To successfully implement market-driven innovative solutions in urban environments, cities need to set the right framework in which solution providers can deploy their shared vehicles.
This means both cities and private solution providers are aligned in terms of operating models, service areas, pricing, legal requirements, etc., and they have a clear understanding of each other’s motivations and overall goals.
As cities are increasingly thinking proactively about their priorities, Seattle is just one example of how public authorities might approach mobility. The Seattle Department of Transportation has produced a playbook on new mobility that outlines many of the key considerations policymakers should bear in mind when collaborating with the private market.
Meanwhile, public authorities in Europe are only now starting to test different collaboration models with private suppliers to implement shared mobility solutions (e.g. Milan, outcome-oriented contracting models; RATP-Paris, set-up of new governance model – creating holding structure).
To regulate and steer the deployment of the private market, cities have a number of instruments at their disposal from permit structures to incentive systems that are currently being developed and tested.

The “smart” movement has gained traction and generated buzz over the last decade, but despite all of the hype, what even is a smart city? The dogma behind its loose definition and goals has been rather elusive, and while some claim that it relies on digitization of all urban aspects, others argue an increase in personal data collection is the sole method for improving urban lifestyles. One person’s digital paradise is perhaps another person’s technophobic doomsday. 
Extending beyond the mere definition of these cities, what role do designers and researchers play in creating this loosely identified futuristic landscape? As Corbusier once defined a home as a machine for living, it’s time to redefine how our buildings shed their passive exteriors and become the true machines for working that they were always meant to be.
What makes a smart city successful is established by perfecting the secret sauce that captures the lifeblood of a place and integrating it with impactful technology. It’s where the dynamic neighborhoods that Jane Jacobs once described meet at the intersection of sustainability, and a more cost-effective way of living.
 Smart cities and their ideals are not going anywhere, and we may see them play out in our future sooner than we expect. A report released in 2018 estimated that the smart city market will grow to $2.57 trillion in the next five years. What comes next between now and then, is the refinement of the definition of a successful city that helps researchers and architects create more humanized urban centers. Will these cities tip the scale towards dystopia or lean towards the creation of the highly sought after utopia? 
Although very few smart buildings and smart cities have been realized, those that have, are often criticized as falling short of their ambitious goals. Consider the popular case studies of Songdo, South Korea and Masdar City in the United Arab Emirates- two self-defined smart cities that are seen as too tech-centric and lacking many human experience factors. 
The result produced two cities that widely expanded internet broadband infrastructure and literacy, but only saw minimal success in other aspects of improving the quality of urban life. Barcelona is one of the more successful examples of creating a balance between technology and humanism, as the city is setting the bar high with its Smart City 3.0 strategy. The idea is to place emphasis on citizen empowerment, rather than the highly controversial data collection methods that some other municipalities around the globe promote.
The Research Team at Gensler, the largest global architecture, design, and planning firm, also has a stake in promoting these ideologies, and is heavily involved in developing guidelines for designing smart cities. Their focus has been on the advancement of technologies with an emphasis on bettering urban centers for those who inhabit them at the scale of an individual. The team’s investigations have drawn several conclusions about the elements needed to integrate technology with city management in a way that respects human rights, civic nature, and the public’s pocket.
Courtesy of Gensler
In a recent publication by the firm, Hans Neubert, Gensler’s Global Creative Lead of Digital Experiences weighed in on the topic by saying, “Smart city technologies are not going anywhere anytime soon. If early experiments have taught us anything, it’s that these technologies need to be directed toward pre-identified and necessary purposes, and that the urban citizen receives a tangible benefit from them. In other words, smart cities need to be humanized.” He goes on to describe four strategies that can be implemented to ensure that smart cities benefit those who inhabit them:
Reducing 15-30 minutes a day on commute time through the implementation of smart parking and intelligent traffic signalsReducing disease by 8-15% through increasing telemedicine abilities and providing real-time air quality informationReduce crime by 30-40% through real-time crime mapping and predictive policing strategiesReducing emissions by 10-15% with building automation and dynamic electricity pricing
According to Neubert, “When done right, smart city technologies can provide a platform for a two-way dialogue between citizen and city, and architects are in the unique position of demonstrating how this can work in practice at a limited scale.” In this age, considering the majority of the world’s population lives in urban areas, architects must answer the call and work to develop this model for generations to come. And with all of the speculation and excitement around these smart cities, the future may be coming sooner than we think.

The trucking industry has always been a vital link to helping populations across the globe thrive, but the current COVID-19 pandemic has shown the world just how critical fleets and drivers are to our survival. Transporting essential goods to grocery stores, hospitals and medical facilities in particular, fleets are operating round the clock, with drivers on the front lines alongside healthcare professionals. Recognizing that protecting both cargo and driver are essential to the supply chain, fleet operators have never been more dependent on telematics. Providing invaluable insight into nearly every aspect of their fleets—from vehicle location to driver health—securing the lines of communication and data transfer has taken top priority.
Because telematics generates a vast amount of data, it is important to understand how the data is handled and protected. Expansive and multi-tiered, these systems are a combination of physical hardware and software that can be complemented by an ever-expanding list of third-party integration options such as Bluetooth beacons, temperature and tire pressure sensors, collision avoidance systems, in-vehicle cameras and verbal feedback to name a few. With so many components involved, protecting telematics data requires a comprehensive, proactive approach that is defined by strong policies and processes, as well as a company culture not only dedicated to following best practices but also ensuring security at every stage. Key considerations and questions include:
1). Security in Design and Manufacturing – Platform providers with full control of design, manufacturing, assembly and testing offer a competitive advantage in ensuring security has been prioritized from the start. Without the need to rely on any other party, they can quickly and efficiently respond to manufacturing defects or potential hardware vulnerabilities internally. The important question to ask: Who manufacturers the telematics hardware, and will the device be the same across my entire fleet?
2). Firmware Security – A telematics device will receive many updates to its firmware over the course of its life, with these updates introducing new features or resolving issues after it has been installed in a vehicle. Because the device automatically receives over-the-air (OTA) updates and performs them without disrupting the user, hackers have a potential opening enabling them to replace the firmware on a telematics device with malicious firmware of their own. To prevent an attack like this, the device can be secured by controlling firmware installation at the manufacturing stage and requiring digital signing to OTA updates that verify they have come from a trusted, authentic source. Without both steps, it is impossible to know if the device is under the control of a malicious party. The important question to ask: Is the firmware signed to prevent outside parties from changing the code on the device?
3). Secure Data Transfer – The telematics device sends and receives data to and from the storage and processing servers, over a cellular connection. Although varying by territory, provider and infrastructure, cellular communication is commonly done over 2G, 3G and 4/5G networks, whichresearchers report each have their own unique vulnerabilities to hackers. By using strong, end-to-end encryption, the security of data between a telematics device and the destination server is ensured. The important question to ask: Do you encrypt the data as it is sent over the cellular network?
4). Security in the Cloud – Telematics devices relay their data to storage and processing servers. While physical servers can be protected by restricting access to authorized personnel, and the data by securing the cloud environment through industry-standard firewalls, access control and activity monitoring, even the most secure systems are not perfect. In the event of a security breach, it is critical to have effective incident response and business continuity plans. Responding effectively and efficiently to a breach event helps reduce data manipulation or theft and increase recovery times and will ensure valuable customer information or internal information is kept safe and secure. The important question to ask: In the event that your servers are compromised, what sort of response and mitigation strategies do you use to protect the data?
5). Corporate Culture of Security – An organization that is serious about security will protect against security issues by continuously monitoring and regularly updating their systems, training employees, refining processes and proactively searching for and identifying potential vulnerabilities. At the very core of the telematics system is a team of engineers and technical staff that keep everything running smoothly. It is essential that an organization maintain vigilance at all levels, especially at an employee level. This can be accomplished by controlling and monitoring access privileges, creating and monitoring log records of important operations and making sure all employees are aware of the risks related to their actions. A strong culture of security should instill confidence in employees and their ability to respond to security threats without creating anxiety about attacks that may or may not come. The important question to ask: Do you have security documentation that covers your hardware, your servers, the transmission of data, as well as policies for employees?
Building Security Confidence
A great way of building security confidence and safely exposing a telematics system to threats is by performing penetration tests, which are sanctioned hacking attempts performed either in house or by a company specializing in computer security. In a penetration test, attempts are made to find vulnerabilities in hardware and software. The attack methodology will then be documented, with a detailed report that provides the following actionable steps and recommendations to bolster security:
Implement secure data transferDigitally sign updatesEnable hardware code protectionAssume your code is public so you do not rely on secretsUse cryptographically strong hashing algorithms that cannot be reverse engineeredIndividualize security critical dataUse different keys for different rolesMonitor metadata to detect hacksDo not forget to disable debug featuresPerform third-party auditingLimit server accessApply secure design practicesImplement support for software/firmware updatesVerify and testDevelop a security culture
Finally, and perhaps most important, while driving a truck can be stressful in the best of times, drivers have reported an increasing sense of isolation on the road as the coronavirus unfolds. Subject to long hours, closures on their routes (rest stops, restaurants and more) and strict health and safety regulations, they need support more than ever. In addition to a brief video check-in from operations and fleet administrators, knowing emergency services can be reached in real time goes a long way when the miles between destination and home seem endless. Secure telematics platforms not only keep the lines of communication open for drivers but also the data that keeps them moving forward.

GM still committed to rapid BEV roll-out and will have first driverless model ready within 5 years.
 by Paul A. Eisenstein 
The coming year will see a flood of new battery-electric vehicles rolling into U.S. showrooms, including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Volkswagen ID.4 and the Cadillac Lyriq.
The latter is one of 20 new BEVs General Motors plans to roll out by 2023, but despite the automaker’s goal of reaching “an all-electric future,” CEO and Chairman Mary Barra said it will take decades for that to happen.
“We believe the transition will happen over time,” Barra said during an appearance on Bloomberg Television, cautioning that even by 2040 not every new vehicle will be all-electric “It will happen in a little bit longer period,” she told interviewer David Rubenstein, “but it will happen.”
Among major automakers, GM has announced one of the most aggressive electrification programs. Earlier this year, it showed the automotive news media nearly a dozen different products, ranging from a stretched version of its first long-range model, the Chevrolet Bolt, to an all-electric supercar, the Cadillac Celestiq. There will be battery-powered sedans and both SUV and pickup versions of the GMC Hummer.
GM teased the GMC Hummer during the Super Bowl and later confirmed there will be both pickup and SUV.
“We want to put everyone in an EV,” Barra said.
Despite Barra’s caution about how soon the transition will occur, GM is maintaining plans for 20 separate BEVs by 2023, with a target of reaching 1 million global sales by 2025.
The word, global, is critical, because the GM CEO – like many industry experts – anticipates the U.S. will be relatively slow to embrace electrification, especially when compared to the Chinese and European markets where regulators are pushing hard for the transition to “new-energy vehicles.” Significantly, both China and Germany have taken steps to incentivize such products as they push to revive vehicle demand after the coronavirus pandemic.
If anything, U.S. incentives are set to start phasing out. Tesla lost its tax credits for BEV buyers entirely at the beginning of the year and GM and Nissan’s incentives are phasing out as a result of hitting sales thresholds. The same will happen to numerous other automakers over the next few years as they add models and boost sales.
GM has, nonetheless, remained at least cautiously bullish, betting it can overcome consumer reluctance with new technologies, such as its Ultium batteries, that will lower EV costs and deliver longer range, improved performance and shorter charging times.
GM now plans to focus on its own driverless ride-sharing shuttle operation through San Francisco-based Cruise.
The largest of the U.S. automakers is betting big on new technologies that include not only EVs but AVs, or autonomous vehicles.
Earlier this year, GM’s San Francisco-based subsidiary, Cruise LLC, showed off a prototype of what is expected to be its first driverless model, the Origin. The toaster-shaped shuttle was expected to soon go into a ride-share test program in the Bay Area. What’s unclear is how that project will proceed considering the pandemic which has not only resulted in government restrictions but also raised concerns by consumers about the safety of using ride-sharing and mass transit.
Despite such concerns, Barra said she “clearly” sees GM putting its first autonomous vehicle in production by mid-decade.
“I definitely think it will happen within the next five years,” she said during her Tuesday TV appearance. “Our Cruise team is continuing to develop technology so it’s safer than a human driver. I think you’ll see it clearly within five years.”

Google Maps may be working on a feature that will give users the most accessible transport options.
Wong stated that users will get multiple options to use their modes of transport for the first mile of transport.
These connections to public transit route options would cover first-mile transportation right from bikes, cars, motorcycles, and auto-rickshaws as well.



Google Maps has been introducing features to make things convenient for its users. The 15-year-old app recently rolled out tools so that users can spot grocery stores and COVID 19 testing centres on the app.
Jane Manchun Wong who keeps track of the developments happening in Facebook, Twitter, and other apps has noted that Google may be working on a feature that will connect users to multiple transport options with public transit.
In a series of tweets, Wong stated that users will get multiple options to use their modes of transport for the first mile which is a little over 1 kilometer.
These connections to public transit route options would cover first-mile transportation right from bikes, cars, motorcycles, and auto-rickshaws as well. The options will also include ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, a report by 9to5 Google stated.
The development, if it materialises, will be quite a big one as it will come in handy for users post lockdown period. Moreover, there will not be a need to switch between multiple apps if this happens.
The report also stated that the new Maps filter would allow users to pick and choose the types of transportation users would opt for in the first mile as well as the last mile on a daily commute.
Google will also inform commuters about the fares of the transport they would use. Google would link through the ride-sharing app to get an estimate of the user’s distance and inform about the fares from Google Maps itself.ADVERTISEMENT
Where UI developments are concerned, the Search bar is likely to get a profile picture on the right-hand side and a Google Maps logo on the far-left hand side. The change is likely to be more visually appealing. It is not clear when these developments will be rolled out or if they will be rolled out in the same way as spotted as per reports.
However, since many ride-hailing apps have the option of multiple transport options, Google may collaborate for these developments.
Google Maps recently rolled out features to avoid crowds when using public transits in the backdrop of COVID 19. The aim was to keep users informed about areas affected by Coronavirus. Google Maps would do so by providing users with alerts. These alerts would be from local transit agencies.
Through this feature, users will be able to see if a public transit station is historically more or less busy.

A new congestion pricing policy that begins in Chicago this month is aimed not only at reducing traffic but also moving toward a more equitable, and lower-carbon, transportation system.
In her first State of the City address in August 2019, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she was “exploring revenue options to address rampant congestion that solves the problems of traffic, pollution and other issues.” New fees imposed on ride-hailing services, such as Uber and Lyft, are a part of that strategy.
The new fee structure, which began on Jan. 6, increases fees for trips in the downtown core while lowering rates for shared rides elsewhere in the city and for wheelchair users. Revenues from the fees are projected at $40 million, with $2 million going toward transit projects.
The new fees are based on findings in an October 2019 study produced by the city. The study found that between 2015 and 2018, the number of trips by ride-hailing services more than tripled, with half of rides either beginning or ending downtown, and nearly one-third of rides taking place entirely within the downtown area. The report also found that ride-hailing services had adversely affected transit ridership.
While Chicago’s new fees differ from a London-type congestion pricing scheme — in which drivers must pay a daily fee to drive within a designated charge zone — they do fall under the broad umbrella of congestion pricing, according to Audrey Wennink, transportation director for the Metropolitan Planning Council. Other options include managed lanes, which employ tolls or other restrictions on a specific lane of a road to control the flow of traffic. Parking can also be considered congestion pricing, she added, “depending on how it’s done.”
“It’s kind of like a suite of tools,” she said. “It doesn’t mean one thing.”
Both Lyft and Uber strongly opposed the fees. Each service issued statements claiming that the fees would have a disproportionate effect on low-income residents on the city’s South and West Sides. In its statement, Lyft claimed that the new fees “reduce affordability and reliability while doing nothing to improve mobility.” Uber was even more explicit, stating that the new fees “will take money out of the pockets of riders, who rely on apps to get around, and of drivers — half of whom live in the south and west sides of the city” and “who do not contribute to congestion and lack reliable access to transportation.”
A coalition called Moving Illinois Forward published results of a survey in September 2019 urging a repeal of the new fees. The survey claimed that for a majority of Chicagoans, particularly among the African American and Latinx communities, ride-hailing filled a gap in service created by taxicab drivers who discriminate against riders of color.
However, this claim has been widely disputed. The Center for Neighborhood Technology found that the new fees were more equitable than the previous flat fee structure. Under the new varied fee structure, the cost of trips between neighborhoods would actually decrease.
Lightfoot also received support from a group of transportation and sustainability organizations including the Metropolitan Planning Council, the Center for Neighborhood Technology, the Active Transportation Alliance, the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, the Shared-Use Mobility Center, the University of Illinois at Chicago Department of Urban Planning and Policy, and the Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University. Ride-hailing service Via was also a signatory to an open letter addressed to the mayor.
A legacy of segregation
The South and West Sides of Chicago are geographically larger, yet more sparsely populated than the North Side. These neighborhoods are primarily populated by low-income residents and people of color. There is also less access to public transit, especially rail transit, than in the city’s North Side, which is predominantly white and more affluent.
For example, the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) rail system extends north past the city limits through Evanston to Wilmette, and as far west as Forest Park and Oak Park, both western suburbs. By contrast, the system only extends as far south as 95th Street, miles short of the city limit, which borders with Indiana.
As a result, many residents on the city’s South Side and West Side primarily rely either on buses or cars — including rideshare — to get around. But approximately $2 million of the $40 million projected to be raised by the new fees will be devoted to expanding transit in the region, through projects like the bus priority zone and the proposed Gray Line.
The Bus Priority Zone Program, a joint project by the transit agency and the Chicago Department of Transportation, is designed to relieve congestion and improve service on seven bus lines throughout the city. The first project of the program is the introduction of two bus-only lanes, improved signage and other enhancements along 79th Street — served by one of the highest bus ridership routes in the city.
The Gray Line has been promoted since 1996 by transit advocate Mike Payne. The Gray Line would introduce CTA pricing and service frequency to the existing Metra Electric line, a commuter rail service that runs from downtown Chicago southward.
In recent years, the idea of coordinating Metra and CTA service to provide a service like the Gray Line has gained traction. A coalition of nonprofit and business groups support the idea. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle recently backed a pilot program to introduce lower fares and expanded service on the Metra Electric and Rock Island lines that service the city’s South Side and in the southern suburbs. Lightfoot has expressed reservations about the plan, claiming it would adversely affect CTA ridership. However, the mayor’s office reports that discussions are ongoing.
Thoughtful implementation of congestion pricing, along with devoting at least a portion of revenues raised to enhance transit programs like the bus priority zone and the Gray Line could conceivably create an equitable congestion pricing system in Chicago, according to Wennink.
“The overall goal for all of transportation should be having the most sustainable modes of transportation be attractive choices and work well for people,” she said. “And that’s transit, biking and walking. It’s environmentally sustainable. It’s good for the region, and it’s good for everyone. But you have to make it attractive. You have to make it worthwhile for people. You have to make it available. You have to make the fares reasonable. Policies that we’ve had have favored cars and favored roads, and we need to work in the other direction.”

 In a webinar hosted by Partners for Automated Vehicle Education, leaders from self-driving tech companies Aurora and Zoox candidly debunked consumers’ top AV misconceptions. 

In a webinar this week, former National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) head Mark Rosekind shared a stark statistic: Approximately 36,120 people died in motor vehicle accidents on U.S. roadways in 2019, with 94% of the crashes related to human choice or error.
The statistic set the stage for a conversation around autonomous vehicles (AV) and their potential to drastically reduce roadway accidents. The conversation, hosted by Partners for Automated Vehicle Education (PAVE), featured Rosekind — now the chief safety innovation officer at AV startup Zoox — and Chris Urmson, CEO of AV startup Aurora.
At the core of the conversation was an understanding that the success of self-driving vehicles will rely largely on consumer education and comprehension of the technology. In this respect, Rosekind and Urmson spoke candidly on the topics of technical development, cybersecurity, regulation and even the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to dispel common misconceptions regarding AVs.
Smart Cities Dive identified five key myths debunked by these self-driving startup leaders:
Myth 1: Safety is a feature built into AV tech
While safety is the key focus of self-driving technology among all companies and regulators, it will require years of research and an internal adoption of safety practices to truly develop, Urmson said.
“Safety is not one of these things you kind of bolt on at the end. It’s not one of these things where you have a team that’s building a technology and saying, ‘Ok now we need to make it safe,’ … It starts with building a safety culture in your organization,” he said. This includes encouraging employees to speak up when they have concerns and weaving safety practices into the way technology is developed, Urmson said.
Rosekind said this can be a challenge as the automotive industry has operated by using reactive safety practices for a century.
“There’s been a crash, somebody’s hurt, somebody’s died. [Then we] figure out how we fix it, maybe for the next one,” he said. The AV industry must move toward a proactive safety culture, as seen in the aviation industry, to prevent crashes from happening in the first place, he said.
“That’s what this new technology offers more than anything before,” Rosekind said.
Myth 2: Regulators are stalling AV development
Since the onset of self-driving systems, tech developers have scrambled through an evolving regulatory landscape. While many state governments have enacted varying degrees of AV regulation, federal legislation has stalled in Congress amid concerns about the adequacy of safety provisions.  
The U.S. Department of Transportation is aware of a need for guidelines, however. In January, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao unveiled the department’s newest autonomous vehicle (AV) guidelines, AV 4.0, which intend to foster collaboration in deploying advanced driving systems.
Therefore, when asked if regulators are to blame for developmental roadblocks in self-driving technology, Rosekind promptly said “no.” He pointed to complications around having three varying regulatory bodies — federal, state and local governments — but said challenges arise more when developers push the limits of compliance in their jurisdictions.
“We need innovation, we need data-driven best practices, then we’ll eventually get the regulation we need,” he said. “It’s absolutely in our future.”
Myth 3: All AVs will eventually face the ‘trolley problem’
For decades, the “trolley problem” has been used as a thought experiment to discuss ethics and moral dilemmas. The problem presents a trolley heading down railroad tracks toward a group of people, with an option to redirect the trolley onto a track where there’s only one person. The situation poses the question: Which path should the trolley driver take? Is there even a right answer?
The classic experiment has been referenced repeatedly when discussing self-driving technology: If a child runs into the street, would an AV hit that child or swerve and hit another car? According to Rosekind, no AV should ever have to make such decisions.
“A really good engineer should never put you in that situation,” he said.
Urmson explained the trolley problem is “much more of a tool for having a conversation around our societal values,” as opposed to a situation that developers worry about.
“The trolley problem is not new, we didn’t come up with it … It’s really a question of, how do we value life and what’s our expectation on that?” he said.
Myth 4: AV systems are at high risk of cyberattacks
With the development of such high-tech driving systems, many researchers have questioned if AVs are at an increased risk of cyberattacks. And while cybersecurity definitely matters in AV development, Urmson said it’s not as big of a concern as consumers or researchers may think.
“The thing that is overlooked sometimes is that our vehicles today are already very connected,” he said, pointing to existing developments like cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) technologies already widely used on U.S. roads. The inherent nature of AVs to be equipped with more electronics does not necessarily make them more susceptible to risks, he said.
“Most cyber crime is about making money, and there isn’t that much money to be made in taking control of a vehicle on the road,” Urmson said. “While we need to be thoughtful about the long-term kinetic risk and the injury risk that’s there, it’s important, but it’s not the most important risk that we have to be working against.”
Myth 5: AVs are the magic bullet to solve safety and mobility problems
AV advocates have long touted the many potential benefits of AVs: increased safety, lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, more productivity on commutes. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, AVs have been used by some agencies to safely transport goods and reduce the kinds of human interaction that’s typically experienced with traditional human-driven vehicles.
Despite these benefits, however, Rosekind made clear that self-driving cars are not a magic bullet. While he believes the industry is currently in a “moonshot moment” to transform societal systems, AVs won’t serve as a solution to all safety and mobility problems currently seen today.
“They are not a panacea,” Rosekind said. “As much as we could say, ‘If they were here today what a difference they could make,’ let’s not think for a moment that we’re going to get to zero fatalities in the next week or that we’re going to solve all of our social problems.”

Carmakers and components producers globally have heavily invested in self-driving technology for years, but face a difficult continuing reality:
Consumers are uncomfortable with autonomous driving technology today and expect to remain leery about it in years to come.
 Only 15% of U.S. residents in a recent survey said they would feel comfortable interacting with autonomous driving technology currently. In a separate response, only 15% said they would eventually feel comfortable interacting with autonomous driving tech.
The survey, conducted by software interface design firm Myplanet, questioned 1,000 adults of all ages from all regions of the United States.  They were shown a photo of a man seated in car behind the steering wheel with his legs crossed and reading a book, obviously not engaged in actively driving.  Then they were asked whether they agreed with this statement: “I would feel comfortable interacting with this technology,” to which 6.3% said they strongly agreed and 8.5% said they agreed, a total of 14.8%.   
Also, 50.9% said they strongly disagreed with the statement, while 19.1% merely disagreed, for a total of 70% who would not feel comfortable interacting with the technology.
The results confirm earlier separate surveys going back several years on the subject and reinforce the difficult task that autonomous vehicle (AV) designers and robo-taxi service providers face in getting the public interested in the technology.
“The presentation challenge for the industry is to get people comfortable with the technology, but that’s not a comfort level that will be achieved in two years or five years,” said Myplanet CEO Jason Cottrell in a telephone interview with FierceElectronics.
“Autonomous driving is not a selling feature right now and it’s actually a detriment,” Cottrell said. “There’s going to be a need for society to get comfortable with components of the concept and hear use cases. Successful operators of autonomous services are going to need to think how to get consumers into the concept.”
Interest and investments in AVs by carmakers and robo-taxi service providers as well as companies that make chips for components could be coming from technology-focused early adopters who live in a bubble apart from mainstream consumers, he said.  The questions raised in the survey look at AV readiness for the mainstream public, not early adopters.
Cottrell said the survey results were convincing in that they detected a very low comfort level with autonomous driving by respondents (just 15%), but also a very high discomfort level, with 70% saying they would  not feel comfortable interacting with the technology.  As with earlier independent studies, the biggest fans of autonomous driving are males age 18 to 34 and the biggest discomfort levels come from women age 65 and older. The strongest support comes from people living in the west and the least support from people in the south.
“The thing that was so striking was that autonomous driving was at the bottom of 35 autonomous technologies we surveyed,” for comfort levels, he noted.  Survey respondents were most comfortable with hotel check-in kiosks, passport control kiosks, home automation, shelving and inventory robots and food delivery robots. 
By contrast, they were most uncomfortable with autonomous driving, ranked at the very bottom of 35 technologies. Robot nurse was close behind, followed by an interactive therapeutic robot, an AI targeted smart ad and and a helper robot.
“People would much rather have a wearable mechanical exoskeleton in the workplace”  than ride in a self-driving car, Cottrell added. Also, he noted that autonomous driving has been subject to heavy investment for years, yet still ranks below robot nurses that are not well understood or popular. 
In a future survey, Myplanet intends to ask about the public’s comfort level with autonomous flying drones.  There actually might be a higher comfort level with flying drones, partly because people know so little about them, he said.
“Our hypothesis is that there’s a bit of a trough of disillusionment with autonomous driving, since there relatively few proven examples,” Cottrell said. “That’s not uncommon with new tech and that may be true here.”
It hasn’t helped that there have been press reports of crashes with cars equipped with driver assistance technology, he added.
A general trend Mypilot’s survey found regarding comfort levels across all 35 autonomous technologies  is there’s greater discomfort with technologies “that hit to the core of the personal and things innately human and trust-oriented where there’s likely to be social hesistancy,” Cottrell said.
 “We believe in autonomous driving technology as a company, but we need to see the presentation of it shift and to tread carefully,” he added.  “There will be levels of autonomous driving. It might start with, ‘would you like to get in my Tesla and see the auto pilot?’
Myplanet envisions consulting with companies on the control interfaces such as touch or voice used in robo-taxis by the passengers. 
The survey’s finding of a relatively high degree of comfort with food delivery robots was bolstered by research from the Consumer Technology Association released on Wednesday. Sixty percent of respondents in a CTA survey view robotic delivery vehicles and self-driving vehicles more favorably than they did in the past.  Part of the reason for the improvement is seeing such technology used to deliver food and other essentials in San Francisco and Fairfax City, Virginia, during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, said Steve Koening, vice president of market research at CTA during a webinar.

CITIES are for people. How they are planned and designed should simultaneously adapt to the existing and forthcoming shifts and challenges, while creating a safe environment that enhances people’s quality of life. Smart city solutions help solve urban challenges and problems. Conscious urban planning elevates and transforms cities to be smart and future-proof — to be resilient, well-connected, self-sufficient, socially inclusive and compact.
Above all, smart cities are citizen-centric, utilizing information and communications technology to rationalize and support development planning to deliver more efficient and high-quality urban services that ultimately improve people’s lives. Smart cities are driven by big data collected by various technologies. The data is transformed into smart programs and systems that are tailored to address our needs.
According to the IESE Cities in Motion Index 2019, London is the smartest city in the world followed by New York, Amsterdam, Paris, Reykjavik, Tokyo, Singapore, Copenhagen, Berlin and Vienna. London, the No. 1 city in the index, has released a road map that will guide its objective to be the world’s smartest city. The road map is known as London’s “flexible digital master plan.” It lays out how the city government can work with the tech community, Londoners, the academe and even other cities to enhance public services, strengthen and expand data sharing and cybersecurity, and boost public Wi-Fi and fiber connections in homes, among others.

Smart cities consist of several components, namely smart government, smart economy, smart living, smart people, smart mobility and transportation, smart environment, smart communications, and smart security. Each one has an integral role in making a smart city effective. Smart government refers to transparency, availability of open data, ease of doing business, no red tape and no corruption. We hope more government transactions and services can be decentralized, expedited and completed online, so customers do not need to show up in government offices to accomplish their transactions. A great example is the DubaiNow portal where customers can seamlessly and efficiently access more than 55 government services provided by 24 of Dubai’s government agencies in just one portal. DubaiNow allows customers to receive personalized and secure government-to-consumer services like bills payment, visa tracking, car registration, and renewal of trade licenses, among others.
Smart economy supports and strengthens entrepreneurship, innovation and interconnectivity — allowing small and medium enterprises, and big companies to prosper. With its thriving digital business ecosystem, Seoul has become an example of a successful smart economy. Meanwhile, smart living promotes the security, health and vitality of communities. In Kashiwanoha Smart City in Japan, improving health and well-being has been a focal point of its smart city initiatives. Kashiwanoha promotes systematic and extensive application of wearables that monitor health and the development of virtual communication between patients and health care professionals, among others.
Smart mobility encourages faster, environment-friendly and more affordable transportation options. Adults need to take at least 10,000 steps or walk 7 kilometers per day to stay healthy. Smart mobility lessens our dependability on private vehicles by making cities more walkable and bikable, and developing transportation systems to be safe, equitable and with clean technology.
 Hong Kong is known for its world-class public transportation system. It is one of the world’s most densely populated cities, yet it competently meets the mobility needs of its commuters. In fact, Hong Kong’s public transportation system that includes, among others, high-speed rail or mass underground train systems, is famous in the world for being modern and highly organized. Its Mass Transit Railway can accommodate 12.6 million passenger journeys each day, but still, it is consistently praised to be one of the world’s most efficient and convenient transport infrastructures.
In relation to smart people, world-class education is made accessible to everyone regardless of location and time, which strengthens human capital. Singapore developed its Intelligent Nation master plan that gives importance to technology-supported learning.
Through the master plan, Singapore hopes to ensure that 100 percent of homes with school-going children have computers, have broadband available to at least 90 percent of homes and create 80,000 more jobs. With this initiative, lifelong learning and self-improvement are made available even to the less privileged, elderly and people with disabilities.
Smart environment deals with urban plans and innovative ways that protect the environment and the city’s natural resources. New York utilizes an automated meter reading system to determine the city’s water consumption. Devices can be installed in residents’ properties, so they are notified several times each day how much they are consuming. For air quality management, the city uses monitoring stations that can identify air pollution causes, allowing the city to ban certain oil products and reduce specific types of heating systems. With this data, residents are duly informed of their resource consumption, which allows them to take steps on how they can help the city protect the environment and save its resources.
A lot of best practices and smart city principles can be learned from these model cities. If you will notice, even the top smart cities have yet to fully implement smart systems in all aspects of their urban plans and services.
When applying smart city approaches to the Philippine setting, let us study the specific challenges, opportunities and threats that each city has. Nowadays, we are forced to reassess how we plan and manage our cities’ preparedness and response to health crises and other foreseeable threats. 
We need to share general principles, resources and technical expertise, but we have to avoid generic and inflexible plans. Solutions that were successful in some cities may not be the best for others. Let us use available data, technology and expertise to assess our towns and cities to solve the inequalities in housing, health care, food supply and job security, among others. We still have a long way to go compared to the top smart cities in the world. However, it is important to note that these cities first started with incremental yet evolving smart city plans and programs that led to long-term positive effects.

 Connected vehicle technology comes with various environmental and highway safety benefits. However, car dealers need to be tech-savvy, and it’s time consuming to develop a connected car. 
 By Guest Writer
The automotive industry is converging with the information and communication technology (ICT) industry at a rapidly increasing rate. Technology is reshaping the global automotive sector. In the future, cars will become computers on wheels as tech players move into the automotive sector to leverage their existing capabilities. 
The first one hundred years of automotive evolution were marked by a sharp focus on engineering innovation. Cars became more appealing, better at fuel efficiency, safer and more comfortable.
Connected vehicle technology comes with various environmental and highway safety benefits. However, car dealers need to be tech-savvy, and it’s time consuming to develop a connected car.
In 1996, there was a tectonic shift of communication technology; this switching of gears to connected vehicles was led by GM’s OnStar. Each fundamental element of the connected vehicle, like diagnostics, navigation, and infotainment, rapidly changed.
The Next Frontier
We’re now headed to an era where this convergence of digital and engineering innovations will give birth to connected cars that increasingly understand and interact with the environment around them.
A crucial link in that development chain is the infotainment system. Once considered as mere accessories for the car, today’s infotainment systems are fast emerging as a platform for creating immersive experiences. 
Spurred by the rapid progress in AI and natural language processing over the past decade, the growing acceptance of virtual assistants in consumer technology products means that consumers are now inherently attuned to the ubiquity of personalized technology. 
For automakers, therefore, the next frontier is exploring how effortlessly the driver is connected to the outside world during transit. Now, it’s not just about how smart the car is; it’s about how intuitive the software is to the needs of the consumer. 
The fundamental premise of the connected car’s environment lies in the power of wireless connectivity among vehicles (referred to as V2V communications); vehicles and infrastructure (referred to as V2I communications); and wireless communications for crash prevention, which improves mobility and environmental sustainability.  
A connected car is defined by its devices within that connect with devices, networks, and services outside the car, including other cars and infrastructure.
Impacts and Potential Operational Benefits of CVs
Long-range Planning Models
Connected vehicle (CV) technology will have a profound impact on the long-range planning and land-use models used today. It will provide planners with greater insight into each step, leading possibly to more precise models and providing enhanced information for better decision-making. 
Geometric Design of Highways
Roads and signalized intersections are usually designed based on the behavior and characteristics of human drivers. This human behavior might differ vastly from the driverless vehicles’ behavior.  
Unlike people, the automated vehicle uses sensor systems to locate itself along the path and to communicate with other vehicles and/or infrastructure along with the network. This element could lead to optimizing the geometric design of highways, enabling the use of minimum control radii and horizontal and vertical curves. 
Capacity and Traffic Operations
One of the major benefits of CVs and AVs is their potential to increase capacity on freeways and other uninterrupted flow facilities. AVs can improve capacity by using their equipped radars and other sensors to maintain a consistent gap with the vehicle ahead, thereby reducing the headway between vehicles compared to human-driven vehicles.
Highway Safety
Research shows that the deployment of connected vehicle and the combined use of (V2V) and (V2I) applications have the potential to address 81% of unimpaired driver crashes in all vehicle types (i.e., cars and heavy vehicles). Highway crashes can be reduced when vehicles can sense and communicate the hazards around them.
Mobility
According to the Texas Transportation Institute, US highway users wasted 5.5 billion hours stuck in traffic in 2011. CV mobility applications will enable system users and system operators to make smart choices to reduce the delay by providing actionable information and tools to affect the performance of the transportation system in real-time.
Environmental Benefits
The principal pollutants of vehicle emissions include nitrous oxide, sulfur oxide, and carbon monoxide, which have negative health effects. Connected vehicle technologies will generate real-time data that drivers and transportation managers can use to make green transportation choices. 
Challenges to CV Technology
The challenges to the development and application of the CV may be summarized as follows: 
Cars Take Longer to Develop Than Smartphones
The difference in lifecycles in the automotive and the mobile industry is a serious challenge for the future of connected cars. New features, such as operating system upgrades and new applications, are provided almost constantly for the smartphone, whereas car manufacturers work on five-year cycles. 
Carmakers Need Mobile Partners
The automotive and mobile industries have different objectives, but they will need to find ways to collaborate in order to satisfy consumer connectivity needs. General Motors, for example, selected AT&T as its mobile partner.
Car Dealers Need to Be Tech-savvy
The advent of connected cars will dramatically change the dealership model. Salespeople must plan to spend an hour or more teaching customers how to use their car’s advanced technology. 
Connected Cars Will Likely Be Shared Cars
Automakers agree that selling “just” cars is no longer feasible. Mobility with required connectivity to customer services and advanced functions, like power management for electric vehicles, is needed today. That creates opportunities for new ownership models, like Zipcar’s car-sharing service. 
Increased Costs for CV Services
Consumers are used to a one-off payment when purchasing a car, but with an embedded connection, there is an additional bill to be paid in terms of connectivity. Will you add your car as a “device” to your existing mobile bill? Or will the added cost be rolled into your car payment? Who will pay for roaming and data usage? New business models will need to be developed.
Also, issues such as privacy, security, the cost of deploying a system, data ownership, driver distraction, and equity must be taken into consideration in the technology of connected vehicles/cars.
The Benefits Will Be Immense
Due to the wide range of potential applications and technologies, CV technologies can improve operational performance on roads, leading to increased mobility and improved operations.
While fully automated cars are still a prospect of the future, CVs are already on the roads. As companies continue to experiment and these technologies scale, consumers will enjoy a wide array of products and services that we cannot imagine today. These innovations will improve safety, security, mobility, and convenience for consumers.

The last-mile commute challenge is faced by delivery services and the everyday commuter alike. Enhancing last-mile commute with IoT can simplify these challenges with the help of connected devices.








Public transportation doesn’t often provide last-mile solutions. People have to look for alternatives to reach their workplace in the morning and when they return home after a long tiring day at work. Research shows that about 143 million Americans, aged 16 and above, commute daily.
 The last mile is a serious issue as it increases the financial costs for commute, causes delays, and increases the time required for commute while also being inconvenient, especially during the rainy seasons or chilly winters. A potential solution to this last-mile challenge can be IoT. IoT is already transforming public transportation and it can be applied to make the last-mile commute even more comfortable.
Connected last-mile commute with IoT
Connected IoT devices can be leveraged to make the daily commutes more comfortable. These solutions also decrease the overall spending on transportation while proving to be an environmental-friendly option.
Connected ride-sharing options
Connected bicycles can prove to be the best IoT solution for the last-mile commute. Companies have already started providing connected bike-sharing options to citizens. Users can track the availability of bikes, usage, and trip details in real-time. This creates a connected community where commuters can plan their travel to be more efficient.

The only hurdle faced by connected bike-sharing services is their integration in today’s vehicular traffic. Governments must ensure that they have dedicated lanes for bike riders so that the traffic flow is smooth.
Connected electric scooters, too, are available for rent at certain locations. Some companies even provide free helmets to users of their electric scooters, albeit at a small shipping cost. These businesses are working towards a better future for our planet by providing alternative commuting options.
Taxi commuting apps are already popular among the current generation. Many commuters are opting for taxi services like Uber and Lyft for their commuting needs instead of a private vehicle. These taxi services provide the option of sharing the vehicle between multiple riders on the same route.
 This is a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly option when compared to single user rides. These companies sit on a ton of data that can be monitored and analyzed to enhance taxi sharing services further. They can work in a way similar to public transportation but provide a complete commute solution to users, unlike most public transport solutions.
IoT solutions are beginning to solve the puzzle of the last mile commute. However, the answer doesn’t lie in the devices but comes from the data that these devices collect. The data collected from these devices need to be shared and analyzed by private players and governments alike to further improve transportation choices for citizens.
 IoT can prove to be the key to find gaps in our current transportation systems and help fill them. Connected cars, taxis, and bikes are here to stay, and will only increase in number with time. We might not only see a future of last-mile commute with IoT but IoT solutions taking care of all our transportation needs in general.

 Cities now caution people to not to use any public or shared mode of transport 
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has shaken the world economy, reducing it to a complete standstill: Transportation services and industries are on hold, with social distancing a new norm in societies.
This has been pushing cities across the world to re-invent and re-plane mobility strategies.
Public transit services suffer the most in this time. City authorities in India have suspended public transport, with some — including the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation, Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport in Mumbai; Capital Region Urban Transport in Bhubaneswar — providing limited services for emergency workers.
Almost all cities — not all have taken extreme measures — cautioned people to not to use any public or shared mode of transport, including cab services, public / rental e-scooters and bicycles, to keep a ‘safe distance’ of  one to two metres as a measure to enforce social distancing.
A diseased bus passenger infected fellow commuters 4.5 metres away, said a Chinese researcher in January 2020, seriously questioning the definition of safe distance advised by health authorities around the world.
The pandemic has led to a massive decline in transit ridership across the world.
Recent Google mobility data suggests downward changes are as high as 80 per cent in Italy and France, compared to the normal situation in these countries.
Changes in visits at transit station areas in different countries

Source: Google Mobility Data (from February 15, 2020 to April 11, 2020)
The sharp declines in France and India are primarily due to the lockdown that was imposed in the countries on March 17 and March 23, respectively. It is, however, difficult to point out the actual loss or how deep the dent is, as people in every region are either staying at home or working from home.
How cities can re-invent public transit
The bigger question is how the pandemic will impact public transit in the long run. Can transit agencies convince their commuters to continue with existing systems in a post-COVID-19 world?
Previous experience with tackling similar epidemics — including the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2012 — provide some confidence in bringing everything back to normalcy.
The extent and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic are unprecedented and cities need to prepare for a long battle.
Transit operators in different parts of the globe are adopting different strategies to tackle this situation as an immediate measure to protect their staff — particularly drivers and conductors — and passengers. Many bus operators close front doors and separate bus drivers from the boarded passengers.
Transit authorities in Switzerland, for instance, created a temporary barrier within buses using plastic tapes or other means, to separate bus drivers — as well as conductors — from people.
Detroit in the United States has provided portable toilet facilities to its drivers. Berlin, Bejing, cities in Switzerland and Poland are promoting electronic and contactless payments in transit.
Singapore’s Land Transport Authority (LTA) has initiated campaigns and created posters and social media information informing passengers to wear a face mask while traveling, along with other details.
Almost all transit operators asked for ways to improve their cleansing mechanism. Shanghai has begun to use advanced ultaviolet light to clean their vehicles, while Hong Kong now uses robots to disinfect vehicles.
Wearing face masks and gloves — in addition to prohibiting overcrowding transit services — should be made mandatory, while encouraging people to use public transportation to commute.
City authorities are also going beyond transit management to deploy other mobility strategies, to manage overall travel demand.
Cities like Berlin in Germany, Bogota in Columbia have begun to open cycle lanes. Similarly, city authorities are identifying areas with major pedestrian footfall —railway stations, bus terminals, busy market places — to create pedestrian-friendly zones. This will allow people to move freely and at the same time help them to maintain social distancing.
Several measures are under consideration in different global cities. Segregated office timing may help to reduce peak demand and subsequently overcrowding situations.
Cities need to institutionalise this practice underway because of the pandemic. This needs an awareness campaign to promote an active mode of transport and encourage their employees to cycle or walk to office as much as possible.
Neighborhood schools may initiate a new walk-and-cycle-to-school programme, where each school may identify specific road network and request city authorities to develop walking and cycling infrastructures.
Cities should demark on-street parking areas properly to manage parking spaces, introduce dynamic parking pricing to avoid maximum gathering at peak and all the parking spaces should have provisions for freecycle parking.
This pandemic is an opportunity to replan and rethink mobility strategies in the post-pandemic period to keep traffic volume low to control pollution, congestion and exposure.

 To turn Mobility as a Service into widespread reality, transport operators, providers and manufacturers must coalesce around an integrated framework. 
 By Jean-Marie Vial 
From tram to train, from bus to bicycle, MaaS combines all modes of transport to create journeys that can be planned, booked and paid for seamlessly. MaaS shows much promise, so it surely won’t be too long before it moves into the mainstream.
Not long, in other words, before MaaS goes mass market. Except for this: the frontend concept, however compelling, lacks the unified backend infrastructure to support widespread adoption. More on that later but first it’s worth considering why the old rules of transit are being rewritten.
Three interlocking factors are prompting change
First, providers and operators – propelled by citizen sentiment and government policy – are seeking ways to make city living more sustainable. That means less pollution, reduced congestion and lower carbon emissions. Consider, for example, that London has just introduced an ultra-low emissions zone (ULEZ), a pioneering traffic pollution charge scheme, while Paris intends to exclude all gasoline and diesel engines from its city centre by 2030. Analysts at Dutch bank ING believe electric vehicles (EVs) will soon become “the rational choice.”
Second, behaviours are changing. Most notably, there’s a move away from individual vehicle ownership and towards rental or shared ownership. This makes economic sense.  Today, cars stand idle 95%of the time – and reflects a generational shift. Automotive executives believe that by the middle of the next decade, up to half of current car owners will no longer wish to possess a personal vehicle. The advent of connected and highly automated cars is likely to drive this trend further.
Third, transport users want a system that works, that makes life easier not more complicated. In a survey across 19 major European cities, 43% of commuters say that public transport provision “heavily” influences where they choose to live.
What does this mean for those directly involved?
For public transport operators and local authorities, it means providing an environmental and commuter-friendly way of completing the first and last mile of the daily commute. It means offering soft mobility solutions and additional services – such as in the French city of Mulhouse – that present a variety of transport options delivered uniformly with seamless transaction management.
For car makers it means understanding the implications of its double-sided challenge – the transition from the internal combustion engine to EVs, and the move away from private ownership. The auto industry is taking note of these trends, as evidenced by the joint mobility venture between BMW and Daimler designed to compete with Uber; by Renault and PSA’s EV car-sharing programme launched in Paris last autumn; and by VW’s auto-sharing scheme in Hamburg. Even in Europe, there is insufficient EV charging infrastructure to drive widespread demand which could be a limiting factor.
The future must be seamless
These examples of service extension are welcome and necessary for those that want a part in the MaaS future. A problem remains, however: most cities run separate back office systems for each operation – fare collection, congestion charge, route mapping, toll collection, bike hire and so on. Typically, these systems will hold similar – if not duplicate – data and manage similar transactions.
A mixture of historical accident and commercial rivalry has meant systems are rarely linked, thereby preventing synergies that would otherwise benefit all concerned. This needn’t be the case in future. At Conduent, we believe we can help create a new value chain under the umbrella of the Conduent Seamless Transportation System.
Let’s consider the different steps of seamless mobility. A commuter needs firstly to plan a trip. He or she may need to share a car, a bike or a scooter. He or she will need to get a ticket, might need to park a car, pay a toll and seek support from a customer care desk. From a mobility companion solution to ticketing, parking, tolling and customer services —Conduent can deliver them all.
That’s the frontend. From a backend perspective the mobility provider will need to process transactions across the full range of services; fine tune its mobility offering based on updated data analytics; and automate its order-to-cash and source-to-pay operations. Conduent ticketing and business process service solutions will meet these needs.
The advantages are clear. In northern France, for example, 14 local transportation authorities have joined forces to deliver combined bus, train, carpooling and bike hire services to over three million citizens. Conduent has been selected as the Mobility Platform provider. The service plans door-to-door routes based on an array of factors including speed of overall journey, number of connections, maximum walking time, price and carbon footprint.
Built on a unified backend platform, this is the MaaS of the future.

Globally, we are experiencing unprecedented times with the COVID-19 pandemic, but there is a silver lining in every crisis—and in this crisis, could the silver lining be early adoption of autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies?
It is in AVs where we have seen some particularly innovative uses for such a nascent technology.
We are starting to see how the pandemic has triggered a more diverse range of uses for robots, drones, and artificial intelligence technologies in general. Applications that stand out are the use of drones to spray disinfectants across cities, supplying food and medical essentials. Besides repurposed drones, automated systems are in use in healthcare facilities, delivery services, manufacturing, telepresence, and distance learning, among many others. But it is in AVs where we have seen some particularly innovative uses for such a nascent technology.
While there has been increasing use of AVs in China (such as Baidu partnering with Neolix, JD.com using Level 4 autonomous delivery vehicles in Wuhan, and Danish company UVD Robots disinfecting Chinese hospitals) during this pandemic, the first use of AVs in the United States directly related to the coronavirus is demonstrated by the partnership between Jacksonville Transport Authority (JTA) in Florida and AV companies Beep and NAVYA. JTA used AVs to safely transport COVID-19 tests collected at a drive-through testing location at Mayo Clinic in Florida.
Indirect examples of the utility of AVs in the United States during the pandemic is in contactless food delivery, as demonstrated by Optimus Ride. The AV startup, along with its partners, has paused passenger operations and has instead pivoted toward meal delivery services in Fairfield, CA. They are also in discussions with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) and Massachusetts Port Authority (MassPort) to aid the city in providing mobility alternatives for medical workers and goods.
COVID-19 has quickly created significant demand and has put the existing supply chain and delivery infrastructures of many service providers such as shelters, hospitals, and senior care facilities etc. under tremendous amount of tension. But while multiple businesses are affected, AV companies are stepping up.
 Although the majority of the AV companies are start-ups and the technologies are in their early stages, they are adopting rapidly to address the mobility related issues comprising of both passengers and goods. This will tremendously help in keeping the economy on the move while adhering to the new normal. 
The focus needs to be not only on the current pandemic situation but also the post-pandemic scenario where there is staggered reopening of the economy. This provides an opportunistic window for AV innovators to fast track the R&D efforts. This indeed is the belief of autonomous startup driving company Voyage. According to Voyage CEO Oliver Cameron, the operations have halted but Voyage is moving forward with its technology and 100 percent remote work environment.
 While shared mobility services face headwinds, both through and potentially in the post-pandemic times, transportation as a service can be truly a model that AVs can focus on.
The most important aspect of wide adoption of the AV technology is regulatory approval by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). There needs to be a regulatory framework in place. The AV companies must petition the regulators to make an exemption from the current vehicle standards. As an example, it was a three-year-long tedious process for Nuro to obtain driverless testing exemption for its R2 delivery vehicle from NHTSA.
According to the World Economic Forum, regulators should consider the advantages of agile, performance dependent technology frameworks for the technology. They should consider opportunities to streamline the approval process while strictly adhering to the safety standards. It’s a two-way process where the AV companies and public needs to provide their comment via AV 4.0 (Document released by Department of Transportation and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy titled “Ensuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies”) to help regulators finalize the AV technology guidelines.
Clearly, AVs across the globe are significantly contributing towards recovery efforts during the pandemic. It is therefore important to make sure they are supported by funding sources to continue the R&D. However, investors in different parts of United States are warning of a potential dearth of funding in the transportation sector—particularly for AV start-ups—due to COVID-19. They advise the portfolio companies to take multiple measures such as focusing on the core product, reducing the financial needs, cutting the growth spending, and drawing existing credit lines, etc.
Federal stimulus funding will be needed to prevent slowdown in the years of progress.
Federal stimulus funding will be needed to prevent slowdown in the years of progress. To that end, the timing of the U.S. Department of Transportation grant solicitation totaling $4.93 million is appropriate. Part of its University Transportation Centers program, the grant aims to fund transportation progress in the following four areas: a) Highly automated transportation research, b) Communications technology and e-commerce effects on travel demand, c) Implications of accessible automated vehicles for disabled people, and d) Strategic implications of evolving public transit trends.
Most companies working on AV technologies have temporarily stopped their testing due to COVID-19. That opens window of demand for robotaxis and delivery robots such as Nuro’s R2 and those built by Starship Technologies. As with uptake of any new product, the scaling up will be a big challenge. However, Kiwibot and Neolix claim they can meet the challenge. Potentially, that will lead the way for other companies.
While Americans are less confident of AVs, particularly following fatal crashes in Arizona and California in 2018, the current times of social distancing might provide the opportunity to embrace the technology. The surge in demand of delivery robots can bridge the uncertainties in Americans’ mind and pave the way for a seamless adoption of AVs. The sliver lining is that the pandemic might provide the right impetus for the early adoption of AVs.

Toronto’s “smart city” ambitions are taking big steps forward in bringing tech companies into the loop. City officials, starting with Toronto Mayor John Tory, used the recent City-Toronto Board of Trade “smart cities summit” to outline some of the steps planned so that a “smart city” means an “innovation city”.
This fits with one of the key targets set out in the report of the City-Board of Trade Working Group for a Smarter Toronto, Framework for a Smarter Toronto: A Call for Collaborative Action. The City, it said, should “enhance partnerships with industry, universities and incubators; rally Toronto’s innovation ecosystem around the co-creation of urban solutions,” including developing “a mechanism to vet and fast-track new technologies and companies into the City’s procurement system.” Toronto, for example, has something like 60 tech incubators where new technologies and companies can be nurtured.
One key step, as Tory outlined, will be to establish the Civic Innovation Office, which will be a bridge between the City and its agencies and the innovation and tech communities to help solve challenges facing the City. A director is expected to be named in the next couple of weeks. The office, at least initially, is being funded with a $500,000 grant from the Bloomberg Foundation in New York.
As Tory said when announcing the Bloomberg award in March, “Toronto is home to a large population of innovators, start-ups and tech companies which can help the City deliver better services to the public, while promoting a new approach to problem-solving within government.”
Rob Meikle, Toronto’s Chief Information Officer, told the summit that the City was looking at ways to improve its procurement process so that the tech sector can be engaged with the City much earlier in the definition and design of projects. There is also a concern to bring smaller tech companies and entrepreneurs into the process. Emerging companies need customers so access to procurement is critical.
At the same time, Meikle said, the City is in the final stages of an assessment of the City’s basic digital infrastructure, looking at the quality of communications networks and Internet access delivered by Bell Canada, Rogers Communications, Telus and Beanfield, in order to assess future requirements for a “smart city”.
There are three pillars to the “smart city” agenda, Mike Williams, who heads the City’s Economic Development and Culture Office, said. They are: Toronto can do much better in adopting technology to improve city services; improving the quality of telecommunications infrastructure for the digital world, a task of the private sector; and the creation of a powerful new economic engine for the City, developing the entrepreneurial companies that can sell their “smart city” technologies around the world.
There’s another big tech project coming up soon. This summer, Waterfront Toronto is expected to announce the name of the winning partner for a project to develop a future city demonstration site on 12 acres within easy walking district of the downtown commercial core.
This is the Quayside project, which, according to the RFP, “should reflect broader urban innovation, including technology-enabled, inclusive, connected communities,” using world-class digital infrastructure to achieve the benefits of emerging technologies, “including but not limited to the Industrial Internet of Things, analytics, and artificial intelligence – to support data-informed decision-making for residents, visitors, investors, employers, and service providers.”
It will be a testbed for cleantech, building construction, urban transportation and other technologies. One goal will be to help small companies scale up. Sidewalk Labs, part of the Google parent, Alphabet, is reportedly one of the companies looking to participate in Quayside.
A “primary objective” of the broader waterfront revitalization, Waterfront Toronto says,  is to “enable Toronto to compete effectively with other top-tier global cities for investment, jobs and talent.” One way is by providing an environment “in which an urban innovation cluster can be established and thrive. Demonstration spaces, project testbeds, and industry-academic partnerships will be leveraged to accelerate the growth of this important cluster.”
Another innovation project, where construction is expected to start before the end of the year, is the Waterfront Innovation Centre, a roughly $150 million, 400,000 square foot development to attract companies in digital media, advanced visualization, healthcare and cleantech.
In a blog last year, Sidewalk Labs CEO Daniel Doctoroff argued that “a combination of digital technologies – ubiquitous connectivity, social networks, sensing, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and new design and fabrication technologies – would help bring about a revolution in urban life,” a revolution, he wrote, whose impact “will be as profound as the steam engine, the electric grid, and the automobile, the three previous technological revolutions that have largely defined the modern city.”
Toronto’s goal is to be a part of the revolution. But a lot more work, in the private sector, the public sector, and academia, will be required as major cities around the world seek to become leaders in “smart city” technologies and systems. The global market is expected to be worth between $500 billion and $1.8 trillion by 2020, depending on definitions. It’s obviously worth aiming for.

 As smart sensors are placed in billions of connected devices around the world, new IoT applications are generating massive streams of data that enable a world of opportunities. 
Consider the rise of smartwatches that allow people to track their fitness, monitor their sleeping patterns, measure their heart rate, and more. Think of a future where self-driving cars are able to collect, process, and store driving data at the edge to make road travel safer and more enjoyable.
As mobility and ways of working continues to be redefined, Khwaja Saifuddin, senior sales director, Middle East, Western Digital, highlights the top nine use cases of the IoT technologies.
Autonomous and connected vehicles
Down the road, vehicles might be able to reach Level 5 autonomy and drive themselves fully without human intervention. Today, however, car makers and automotive startups are working on getting level 2, 3, and 4 self-driving technology right. Cameras, radar, LIDAR and a host of other onboard sensors are being used to capture information about road conditions, inform appropriate driving actions, and potentially prevent accidents. To make this happen, nearly 1 terabyte of data will be stored onboard in the near-term, and this amount could balloon to 2+ terabytes in the next decade.
Yet, there’s more to the cars of tomorrow than just autonomous driving. Thanks to the Internet of Things, cars can communicate with each other, the road infrastructure, and, perhaps someday, even pedestrians by using “vehicle-to-everything” or “V2X” technology. Fleets of autonomous vehicles could be managed through this type of communication, making travel faster and safer. Onboard the car, IoT-enabled devices could improve the engine diagnostics, GPS data, and infotainment system.
Smart security for businesses and homes
Historically, security systems often simply used a low-resolution camera to passively capture video. This trend held whether at private residences or commercial properties. Now, smart security systems are being purpose-built to capture, store, and analyse continuous video streams. On top of the 4K video captured by high-resolution cameras, these systems can use an analytics layer with machine learning software to carry out pattern recognition and motion detection. For public transportation providers and venue managers, these real-time insights play a meaningful role in public safety – thanks to robust storage and compute at the device-level.
Connecting your home to the Internet (of Things)
What if your home could be mostly automated? That’s the direction that connected home technology is headed in this IoT use case. Smart speakers function like a central command, enabling your household electronics to perform a variety of voice-activated functions. You could, for example, instruct your TV to stream the latest episode of your favorite show while dimming the living room lights and setting the thermostat to a cozy temperature. This approach stretches even further by integrating refrigerators, washers, dryers, and more. The goal is to provide control for most or all of a home’s systems – including energy, climate, entertainment, appliances, and home security – through a connected network of devices, sensors, tools and platforms.
Smartwatches, fitness trackers, and other wearables
Thanks to an influx of new personal devices, the wearables market is thriving. In fact, a recent report predicts that this industry will cross over $27 billion and 233 million units sold annually by the year 2022. This global adoption is due in large part to smartwatches, which are expected to make up over half of all wearables sold in the coming years. Consumers are looking for seamless connection and interaction between their smartphones and smartwatches to track, manage, and secure their data — especially sensitive health data. At the same time, industry analysts are forecasting flat-to-declining sales for fitness trackers – possibly due to a perceived lack of features and inability to sync with existing smartphones.
But, technological innovation won’t just come on the wrist. A new subcategory known as “hearables” could disrupt the wearables industry, using voice-activated, connected headphones and earphones. With more headset makers ditching the headphone jack, these types of devices are expected to become commonplace in the future. Another opportunity is in portable medical devices that monitor blood pressure and heart rate, as well as alert ambulance dispatchers during a medical emergency.
Machine-to-machine (M2M) connected devices
Today’s factories are using IoT-enabled machines to work smarter, not harder. By equipping machines with sensors, factory managers can more accurately map machine workloads, inputs, and outputs. They can also more closely track machine wear-and-tear, which leads to maintenance that is predictive rather than reactive and improves lifespan. With these features, factories are increasingly becoming automated, thanks to the wave of Industry 4.0. M2M devices use embedded and removable flash solutions to aggregate data into a single stream at the edge. This gateway is used to monitor and react to changing conditions on the factory floor. At the same time, unused data is passed on to the central cloud or data center for further processing.
Supply chains of the future
Another IoT use case is in supply chains, which are increasingly global and complex. Customer requirements evolve rapidly, products have to be procured, shipping and delivery routes have to be coordinated – you get the picture. In response, companies are creating connected enterprise systems and using data modeling as a key part of a broader data management strategy. Low-power IoT devices are also being used to track assets throughout the supply chain, and monitor product quality such as temperature, vibration and container openings. By using IoT-enabled devices and transportation routes, further improvements can be made to route planning by collecting in-transit, supply chain data.
Drones for industrial and search and rescue operations
For cinematographers and photographers, drones have helped record stunning landscapes previously unavailable to visual artists. But, these flying devices aren’t just used for this purpose. Oil rig workers are using drones to complete full rig inspections quicker, without sacrificing worker safety or production downtime. Ecommerce companies are looking into drone delivery of their buyers’ goods to their front doorstep. Even nonprofits are making use of drones to monitor deforestation in environmentally-fragile communities.
Outside of commercial uses, drones are serving the public good in search and rescue missions. These machines are helping search and rescue teams locate victims more quickly, evaluate the status of victims, and map the right path for rescue missions. In dangerous mountain rescues, successful drone operations require high performance and high capacity data storage. Read our latest white paper about how reliable storage makes a difference in life-threatening emergencies.
Smart cities: Energy, transportation, parking and more
One of the most promising IoT use cases is in creating smarter, more efficient cities. Public energy grids can be optimised to balance workloads, predict energy surges, and distribute energy more equitably to customers. The same goes for transportation systems in dense, urban environments. Traffic lights could be synced using IoT to adapt to traffic conditions in real-time. During an emergency, first responders can communicate with traffic lights to synchronise and provide direct access to critical locations. Another possibility is to digitally track parking, so that available spaces are automatically sent as push notifications to drivers looking for a place to park.
Farm to tech to table
Today’s farmers are bringing the power of IoT to streamline their operations. As the use of free-range livestock becomes widely adopted, connected technology can track animals as they graze in open pastures. Smart sensors placed in irrigation systems can reduce water consumption to create just the right moisture level in soil for a given crop. It’s even being used to watch over factors such as humidity and temperature in composting. Additionally, farmers can keep tabs on their equipment, mapping out where each item is, tracking its performance, and carrying out predictive maintenance. Outside of traditional farms, wine producers are using IoT to understand grapevine health and sugar levels in grapes.

Gatik, a self-driving truck startup out of Silicon Valley, has boldly claimed dominion over the middle mile segment of the supply chain, the link that connects warehouses and distribution centers to retail stores. Built on a gas-powered Ford Transit 350HD chassis and leveraging proprietary self-driving technology, the 11- to 20-ft. autonomous vehicles (AVs) were engineered to bring ambient, cold and frozen goods to grocery stores and other locations without the need for a human driver.
The company said the trucks’ artificial intelligence and array of sensors provide Level 4 autonomy on the Society of Automotive Engineers scale, which means the truck is capable of traversing its pre-determined route without human intervention for the B2B short-haul segment. Electrification is on Gatik’s roadmap. Safety drivers are still in the cab as the technology is tested. Trial shifts last 12 hours, and so far, Gatik’s fleet of 10 commercial vehicles has delivered more than 15,000 orders in North America.
Walmart has been an early adopter, using the self-driving trucks to move goods between two Bentonville, Ark., stores since 2019. The technology has also tested on public roads in California and Canada. According to Gatik, which means “progressive” in Sanskrit, the deployments “mark the first ever revenue-generating deployment of an AV fueled hub-and-spoke delivery model in North America.
The company likens its solution to shelf-stocking warehouse robots, with logistical benefits including enhanced inventory pooling across multiple locations, the ability to achieve higher delivery output, greater elasticity and scalability, and a reduction in labor costs.
So why is the three-year-old tech company content to be stuck in the middle? 
Gautam Narang, CEO and co-founder of Gatik, noted the $1 trillion supply chain sector is also “stuck,” with only one in 10 retailers turning a profit on delivery. Pair that with the crippling COVID-19 pandemic that threatens driver availability while demand skyrockets and Gatik, which promises less human disruption and 100% contactless delivery, has found itself at the highly sought but rarely found right place at the right time.
“The supply chain is more critical than ever in times of crisis — and crisis also highlights already weak links,” Narang said. “Consumers’ needs and wants have changed dramatically, but the existing supply chain foundation is inelastic and doesn’t support growth or unexpected changes in demand.
“Gatik enables customers to drastically optimize their hub-and-spoke operations and ensure essential supplies get where they’re needed — transporting anything from medical supplies and equipment, to frozen and fresh foods, to everyday items that make us feel safe and secure,” Narang continued.
Another advantage is that tech firms and logistics providers have spent little time thing about middle mile solutions. TuSimple and Plus.ai have focused on Class 8 long-haul segment, while Rivian and Uber are testing out last mile and passenger transport solutions. At both of those ends, edge cases, or variable events that the AI may not be safely prepared to handle, are more pronounced.
“The vast majority of Gatik’s competitors are focusing on B2C deliveries or passenger transportation and as a result, attempting to build an all-environment AV solution with very generic geofencing,” said Santosh Sankar, partner at Dynamo Ventures. “These models pose complex challenges, require specific technologies, and will take a long time to mature. Whereas others in the AV space are having to accept their timelines for deployment need to be adjusted, Gatik has been quietly and successfully delivering a wide range of goods on behalf of its customers, and generating significant revenue as it does so.”

A short time ago, the auto industry viewed millennials as the lost generation. Automakers expected car sales to plummet and prepared for change. But that didn’t happen. Instead, millennials delayed their adoption of cars until they started getting married, having children and discovering the suburbs.
Simultaneously, the growth of the smart mobility movement with the introduction of rideshare, car share, e-bikes, high-speed rail, scooters and automaker-backed subscription models have transformed how we define transportation. This dramatic change has birthed a mobility culture. The “me” foundation of car culture – where a car takes “me,” how it makes “me” feel about myself and how it represents my values – has been replaced by a “we” perspective.
Allison+Partners’ latest U.S. study called “The Birth of Mobility Culture,” found Generation Z (those under the age of 24) will drive this new culture forward in part due to an inherent comfort with connected technology. Gen Z has grown up hand-in-hand with new technology: it is not scary or intimidating to them and they welcome rapid change as the norm.
The tipping point for mobility innovation won’t be determined by how quickly the technology arrives. The true tipping point will be when Gen Z arrives at a life stage when their consumer spending behaviors (and ability to spend) match values synonymous with mobility culture.
The Allison+Partners study revealed Gen Z consumers view cars more like appliances and nearly 56% agree a car represents essentially no more than a means of transportation. Some 70% of Gen Z consumers do not have their driver’s licenses and 30% of this group has no intention or desire to get one. In fact, Gen Z survey respondents actually ranked alternate reality, VR and smart homes higher in interest than autonomous vehicles.
However, those who make up Gen Z do see autonomous vehicles as an eventual reality. Some 60% of those we surveyed believe they will use autonomous vehicles by 2029.
The implications of these insights are far reaching. We need to immediately rethink how we excite Gen Z consumers about transportation options. Automakers should complement or replace attributes of car coolness, such as horsepower, tow capacity and even fuel economy, with new features such as productivity, shared time, or total experience.
Gen Z has shown an early willingness to invest money and loyalty in brands that demonstrate an ability to align marketing with these new values synonymous with mobility culture. The latest example is in Madrid, with more than 5,000 electric scooters – the largest fleet globally – available for on-demand use as a means to cut down on traffic, noise, emissions pollution, and parking issues. Younger Spaniards flock to these options, with companies increasing the size of the fleet more than fivefold in the past year.
Inverse to this lack of interest in driving comes the acceptance of autonomous technologies. With its high trust level of technology, Gen Z will fuel the adoption of autonomous vehicles.
The combination of autonomous transportation with “we” values core to mobility culture suggests a reimagined way to use time while on the road. In fact, data from Allison+Partners’ The Birth of Mobility Culture report shows nearly half of Gen Z consumers (45.5%) are comfortable with shared ride experiences in an autonomous vehicle.
This new mobility culture also calls into question the commute and opens new options for city planning and commute patterns. Our study found almost two-thirds of Gen Z consumers would be willing to accept a longer commute in a self-driving vehicle. While the single driver commuter experience is generally perceived as bad, unhealthy, and stressful, the “we” commute of mobility culture could be a positive and healthy experience similar to today’s train commutes.
This is where it gets really exciting. The combination of being open to longer commutes and shared experiences allows us to reimagine the urban-to-suburban relationship, broaden access to affordable housing, offer solutions for a work-life balance, and improve relationships with each other.
Case in point: researchers at the UK’s University of East Anglia found British workers who commute to work by bus, train or bicycle were happier compared with those who drive their personal car each day. So, if those who make up Gen Z view cars as little more than appliances, treating a self-driving vehicle experience as a form of alternative transportation might have the same effect.
A new forecast released in June 2019 from the International Data Corporation (IDC) indicated that global spending on smart cities initiatives will reach roughly $190 billion over the next four years.
Three of the top five areas that will experience the most spending by 2023 will include smart grid (given the rise of electric vehicles), advanced public transportation systems, and intelligent traffic management.
The output of these investments made by forward-thinking city planners – cleaner forms of personal vehicle transportation, improved transportation usage and reduced traffic congestion – directly addresses “we” values expressed by emerging mobility consumers.
It may also be easy to forget that less than a decade ago, ridesharing did not even exist. In 2019, Lyft went public with more than $25 billion in market cap, as has Uber with a market cap of just under $80 billion. All despite historically disappointing earnings reports.
Our study found one-third of American consumers report regular use of rideshare services (31%) as an alternative to using their own vehicle – an astounding market penetration for such a relatively young service within the marketplace. And Gen Z is only a relatively small portion of the rideshare market. As they age and enter new life stages, the potential for rideshare service growth is massive. The same is true for all new mobility technologies, which are expected to change massively as autonomous options begin to come to market.
If the dramatic and rapid growth of ridesharing is an indicator, mobility culture will accelerate the transition of how cities and denser suburban areas get designed, particularly space allocated for traditional vehicle parking.
Commercial real estate and larger residential housing are expected to convert existing parking spaces to pick up and drop off areas, solar facilities (to enhance vehicle charging options), or even micro green spaces for local communities which could decrease urban heat-island effects in densely populated areas. Similarly, new construction developments will take these smaller footprint opportunities into consideration.
While streets will continue to play a critical role advancing most mobility options, there will be opportunities to narrow them. A decrease in personal transportation won’t require the wide boulevards seen in many cities today, and those that exist can be converted to accommodate cars, micro-mobility solutions, charging infrastructure, pedestrians, and safer dedicated bikeways.
Developers and city planners will see opportunities to convert larger parking structures into infrastructure that can positively impact urban areas. This will include housing options (condos) to address reported shortages or even indoor growing facilities – with the growth of vertical, indoor growing methods – to bring fresh, affordable produce and healthy food options to communities.
The birth of mobility culture and the rise of “we” values suggest future journeys will not be quiet and alone, but ambient rides that are shared with others.

 How self-driving vehicles will change Moscow 
By  NATIONAL RESEARCH UNIVERSITY HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS 
In 15 years, the share of self-driving passenger vehicles on Moscow’s roads will exceed 60%. However, this change will not have a significant impact if personal vehicle travel is not reduced and car sharing services are not expanded. For the first time, HSE University researchers have assessed the effects of self-driving cars on the city. In their study, Alexei Zomarev and Maria Rozhenko lay out predictions for 2030 and 2035. https://foresight-journal.hse.ru/en/2020-14-/350698855.htmlScenarios for the Future
In the coming decade, self-driving vehicles will come into wider use. Researchers are looking more and more at not just driverless cars themselves, but at the potential of their shared use–so-called shared autonomous vehicles (SAV).
This potential affects two contemporary services: ride sharing (in which travelers share a vehicle for travel along a similar route) and car sharing (short-term car rental). When self-driving cars begin to be used for these services, these services will become one–minus the driver.
New technology will affect people’s mobility, people’s employment, road safety, the environment, living conditions, and the accessibility of road transport. Taking these factors into account, Alexei Zomarev and Maria Rozhenko created models of how Moscow will look in the near future.
Based on official city strategies and available data regarding the number of passengers per car, auto sales, the efficiency of road networks, and so on, the researchers created four scenarios for 2030 and 2035:
-stagnation
-Shared use
-Robotization
-Absolute Mobility
The scenarios are characterized by different rates of integrating driverless technology into city transport, as well as different possible states of the public vehicle market, including both traditional and self-driving vehicles.
The Stagnation and Robotization scenarios result from a low level of shared service development, while the Absolute Mobility and Shared Use scenarios are characterized by a high level.
The researchers explain their choices of 2030 and 2035 for their model thus: 2022 marks the beginning of the implementation of driverless taxi services, and 2024 is when self-driving cars will be permitted for private use. The years 2030 and 2035 are therefore optimal times for analyzing changes in transport behavior. Moreover, due to poor source data quality, 2035 represents the outer limit for conducting official forecasts.Stagnation and Robotization
The pace at which self-driving vehicles will take over Moscow is different in these scenarios, but the speed at which shared car services become used more widely is equally slow: the fraction of shared vehicles on the road per day is insignificant.
In the Stagnation Scenario, self-driving vehicles in 2030 will amount to about 10% of vehicles on the road, and by 2035 this number will be 34%. In the Robotization Scenario, the share of self-driving cars will increase from 18% in 2030 to 61% in 2035. However, the benefits reaped from driverless technology in these scenarios will not reach their full potential.
Due to weaker technological development, the rate of automobile accidents in the Stagnation Scenario will decrease to a lesser extent than in other scenarios. Most cars in the city will not be self-driving, and the human factor will therefore play a larger role. In the Robotization Scenario, insufficient quality control over autonomous transport–its condition, location, and IT system security–will pose a serious obstacle.
This will increase tension on the roads due to growing congestion. By 2035, according to both scenarios, the number of cars will reach up to 6 million (compared to 4.7 million in 2019), as well as the number of car owners. While there are currently 293 cars per every 1,000 Muscovites, this number will reach up 464 by 2035.
Road congestion will increase by 13%, and time spent by drivers in traffic jams will increase by 5-10%. The shortage of parking spaces will increase by 1.7 million.
While costs per trip will decrease overall, costs will nonetheless go up due to service costs and the prices of more expensive self-driving cars.Absolute Mobility and Shared Use
Unlike the previous scenarios, these scenarios are characterized by a large proportion of shared vehicles. In the Shared Use Scenario, the rate of integration of driverless technology into car sharing is low; sharing services instead rely mainly on human drivers. In the Absolute Mobility Scenario on the other hand, the rate is high: most transport will be carried out by self-driving vehicles, and the effects of car sharing will reach their optimal potential by 2035:
The number of passengers per car will double up to 2.3 passengers;
The average time spent per trip in Moscow will be 55 minutes, which is comparable to the average time spent per trip using a personal vehicle; 
Daily car usage will increase from today’s average of 6 trips per day to almost 14 trips per day;
Up to 32 people will use one SAV per day.
All this will reduce city residents’ need for personal vehicles, save time, and eliminate the need to worry about parking (if parking privileges for shared cars are preserved).
Accessibility to shared services will not be determined by one’s socio-economic status or health, though it will give rise to social tensions as these services reshape the labor market.
Self-driving cars will lead to job losses for 200,000 people, including drivers, couriers, traffic controllers, and traffic police.
The city will breathe easier: the number of cars will be reduced as much as possible–to 1.6 million. Traditional public transport will have fewer passengers, and some routes will be eliminated.
‘Scenarios with a high proportion of shared vehicles will enable a smaller fleet of vehicles to satisfy a greater demand for passenger transportation,’ the study authors conclude. According to their estimates, under the most favorable forecast for 2030, 58% of trips per day will be made in shared vehicles, and by 2035, this number will increase to 77%. These numbers correspond with global estimates of the effects sharing services in megacities
.In Order to Improve Something, Restrict It
Whether or not the scenarios become a reality depends on the measures taken by the authorities to regulate the auto market. The current transport policy, according to the researchers, is inefficient. It gives rise to weakly controlled personal vehicle ownership growth, and if city governments do not put restrictions in place, driverless cars will get stuck in the same traffic jams as those with drivers.
The number of self-driving vehicles should also not be allowed to grow unchecked. However, to stop the degradation of the urban environment, the city should invest in them as well as shared transport. Car-sharing companies should be encouraged to purchase self-driving vehicles, and city residents should be encouraged to forego owning personal vehicles in favor of using shared forms of transport.
In order to achieve this, the researchers propose a comprehensive set of measures, distributed in accordance with each scenario.
For the Shared Use and Absolute Mobility scenarios, both of which are characterized by a high usage of shared vehicles, the number of personal vehicles can be reduced if:
– Car ownership becomes more expensive due to the introduction of a transport tax; 
– Legislation is passed to limit car ownership rights only to those who own or are renting a long-term parking spot that is within walking distance of one’s home. 
To make the Robotization Scenario a reality, it is important to increase the share of self-driving cars. This can be achieved by prohibiting the use of vehicles that are more than 10 years old or by increasing the vehicle tax.
Tax rates can be determined in accordance with the level of a vehicle’s autonomy: the more autonomous it is, the lower the tax. In addition, the introduction of so-called e-pricing–fares for traveling within the city depending on the time of day and travel zone–can help reduce personal vehicle traffic.
Fiscal changes and new requirements for owners of personal vehicles are far from the only thing needed, but these are the changes city residents will feel most.
Initiatives will turn into social costs, including ‘forced changes to transportation behavior models’, increased travel costs, and the need to adapt to new technology.
Therefore, transport policy, among other things, should be proactive. It should anticipate adverse effects and keep citizens as informed as possible. Future benefits need to be clearly justified, and measures should be ‘introduced gradually and announced in advance, several years before the decisions go into effect.’

The pollution levels in India are increasing rapidly; as per the World health statistics 2016, World Health Organization, approximately 1.5 million people in the country died because of air pollution in 2012. In order to deal with this grave issue, the Indian government is taking several initiatives. One of the solutions for dealing with this problem is the utilization of two-wheeler sharing services, which is being encouraged by the government as well as the environment protection agencies. In addition to this, the people are also becoming increasingly aware regarding the surging pollution levels in the country, which is why the automobile industry has been witnessing a shift toward different electric two-wheelers. 
According to a report by P&S Intelligence, valued at $31.1 million in 2019, the Indian two-wheeler sharing market is predicted to generate a revenue of $94.0 million by 2025, advancing at a 20.2% CAGR during the forecast period (2020–2025). Motorcycle/scooter and bicycle are the two major vehicle types through which two-wheeler sharing services are offered. Between these two, the largest demand in 2018 was created for motorcycle/scooter and the category is also predicted to register the faster growth in demand during the forecast period.  
Urban Road Congestion is a Major Factor Driving the Growth of the Market
The category is further divided into rental, bike taxi, and scooter sharing. Out of these, the highest demand in 2018 was created for bike taxi services and the situation is projected to remain the same in the coming years as well. The reason for this is the rising acceptance of bike taxis in the national capital region and Hyderabad and expansion of operation of market players in cities. Geographically, the southern region is expected to account for the largest revenue share of the market during the forecast period. This is because most of the two-wheeler sharing companies are present in cities of southern region such as Hyderabad and Bengaluru. 
Increasing Number of Investments is Key trend Observed in the Market
One of the key driving factors of the Indian two-wheeler sharing market is the low price and convenience of the services. By adopting two-wheeler sharing services the commuters do not need to take the hassle of bearing costs, including insurance cost and vehicle maintenance, and worry about charging of vehicles and parking arrangements. Moreover, two-wheeler sharing services are mostly available on a 24/7 basis throughout the year, thereby assuring the users of availability of vehicles whenever they need.  The ride can be booked directly from the company’s application, same way as a cab is booked, however, two-wheeler sharing services are 40–60% cheaper than a cab ride. 
Apart from being convenient and cost-effective, two-wheeler sharing services also enable the users to tackle the problem of road congestion. India has a large population base, in addition to which the economic growth in the country has resulted in an increase in the disposable income of the people. Attributed to this, more people are now able to afford vehicles, which has led to increased traffic on the roads of the country. This problem is primarily persistent in the metropolitan cities, such as Delhi and Bengaluru, during the peak hours. Since two-wheelers take less space on roads, their increased usage can help deal with the problem of road congestion in the country.   For more insight on Indian Two-Wheeler Sharing Market by P&S Intelligence

Based on consumer research carried out across 16 markets in Europe and Asia, the report found that majority of the people (82%) surveyed thought owning a car was still important, while 77% report that they own a car outright, and nearly 50% still see the car as their ideal mode of transport.
However, this is set to change with more than two thirds (68%) of people thinking that outright car ownership will not be the most popular way to access a car within the next decade, and over half (54%) are prepared to give up car ownership and rely on long-term rental, on-demand or subscription services. In fact, 59% said that they expect more subscription and on-demand services for cars and vans over the next few years.
Keith Rankin, president, international, Avis Budget Group, said: “Driven by technology advancements and the influence of services like Amazon, Netflix and Spotify, people today want to consume and access products and services at the click of a button. The expectation for an on-demand service has impacted the mobility industry and resulted in the evolution we’re seeing today – from being able to book a taxi instantly to hiring a car for a week-long holiday, all from your smartphone. However, our report reveals that we are now seeing a rise in this demand for instant access and flexibility, resulting in changing behaviours towards car ownership.
“Changing needs and the expansion of the sharing economy offer both challenges and opportunities for the mobility industry. Our research has shown that whilst consumers are expectant of connected, integrated and on-demand services, they still want convenience at a reasonable price.”
Rankin concluded that it’s imperative that different mobility players work together to cater to consumers’ future needs. “We have demonstrated the success of collaboration, as shown with our fleet management as a service partnerships with Via and Lyft, and our agreements with Ford and Continental in providing connected cars.
Our partnerships demonstrate well how the sector can work together to provide the on-demand and connected services that customers want. These can range from a technology giant delivering 5G, or local governments working with the private sector for improved, urban EV access for residents.”

Would you get out of your car and take public transit for money?
Commuter Connections, a regional government program aimed at reducing congestion and promoting carpooling, is launching an app to do just that.
The app, incenTrip, is now available for commuters across the Washington region after a pilot phase last year garnered 30,000 accounts. The app was developed by the Maryland Transportation Institute at the University of Maryland.
 
It works like this: Commuters sign up for the app, enter in a destination and the app provides a list of ways to get there. Each mode has a set amount of points you can accrue based on reducing congestion and improving air quality. Transit, biking, walking and ridesharing earn more points than driving.
 
The app pulls in real-time traffic, weather and work zone information as well as Metro schedules to help commuters make the best choice.
“It basically pulls all of the travel options into one platform and allows you to make choices in terms of what’s best for you during that time of day, and what’s going to work, and then you get rewarded for it,” said Nicholas Ramfos, the head of Commuter Connections at the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments.
 
Points vary based on time, distance and mode. The lunchtime Metrorail trip from the incenTrip press conference near Metro Center to WAMU studios in Van Ness earned 41 points, for example. The same trip at 3 p.m. earns only 21 points. Driving earns two points. Ridesharing earns 34 points.Some points earned during rush hour will go toward a cash reward while other travel will earn gift cards. After earning 1,000 points, users can redeem them for a $10 check or gift card.
“We can’t force behavior change, but we can encourage it and make it more beneficial,” said Marty Nohe, chairman of the Transportation Planning Board and a Prince William County Board of Supervisor.
 
The program has a pool of $70,000 for the year, but Ramfos said they’d reach out to funding partners if the program is a hit. The money comes from the Virginia, Maryland and D.C. departments of transportation. Individuals can earn up to $600 a year.
Officials say they see spending tax dollars to pay drivers to get off the road is a good return on investment. Nohe said if it moves commuters to rideshare or transit, local governments would save money from wear and tear on the roads.
 
Lei Zhang heads the institute that created the app at the University of Maryland. He says during the pilot, the institute once achieved a 2% reduction in travel demand, but the impact was far greater — a 27% reduction in peak period traffic.
 
Ramfos said he hopes the “gamification” of travel makes it appealing for people to use.“I think there are certain segments of the population that this is going to appeal to,” Ramfos said. “It may not be everyone, but … this is one way to nudge people into varying forms of travel behavior.”In reality, the app is a tool for the concept “transportation demand management” which aims to inform and incentivize travelers to maximize the efficiency of a transportation system. The concept encourages people to live closer to where they work, walk instead of drive for short trips and use transit instead of driving alone.
 
“The basis to the app is to use personalized real-time incentives to nudge users to [not drive alone], travel during off peak periods or take less congested routes,” Zhang said.Drivers will get more points early on in the “hook phase” and then start to taper off as users get accustomed to taking other modes of transportation.“The goal is to hook people and encourage that mode shift,” Nohe said. “It will save time, cost and fuel.”
 
The app also has a feature that awards points for more eco-friendly driving. It tracks your braking and acceleration, which decreases fuel efficiency and increases emissions.Local agencies will have access to a dashboard to show the performance and impact of the app and whether it’s making a difference.

While we’re all trying to do everything we can to keep ourselves and our community safe during the coronavirus, sometimes it’s really hard to know what’s fine and what’s not.
For example: running outside? That’s ok. Getting your nails done? Hmm, maybe not. But what about catching an Uber?
Health organisations are recommending people stay indoors when possible, but some people still have to go to work, go to the grocery store, or run errands for vulnerable family members. The government has warned against using public transport, so for some, ride-share apps are the best option.
Most companies, like Uber, Ola, and DiDi have introduced measures to help keep passengers safe. But at the end of the day, it’s up to you to be responsible for your own health. Wash or sanitise your hands before and after being in a ride-share car, and sit in the back seat instead of the front in order to minimise contact with your driver. It’s probably best to avoid Uber Pool or other multi-person rides.
Uber is urging any drivers who feel unwell to remove themselves from the app. They’re also working to provide drivers with disinfectant and cleaning supplies to ensure their cars meet a high level of cleanliness to keep riders safe. They’ve also encouraged UberEats drivers to leave food deliveries on peoples’ doorsteps, rather than handing them over face to face.
Relatively new ride-share app DiDi has introduced a feature to help support drivers who might be struggling with the lower income associated with fewer passengers out in public. From Monday, drivers will receive 95 per cent of every fare they complete, with the company only taking a five per cent cut.
For comparison, Uber drivers in Australia usually receive about three-quarters of their fares, with the company taking 27.5 per cent.
DiDi also pledged $10 million USD to aid drivers who test positive for COVID-19 or are forced to self-isolate by official organisations. They will provide drivers with a one-off payment to help them cover living costs while unable to work.
Uber has announced a similar initiative in Australia, giving financial assistance to any existing Uber drivers who are unable to work due to quarantine or self-isolation reasons.
Ride-share companies are doing their bit to ensure you stay healthy if you need to use their service. So long as you keep yourself clean and take necessary precautions, you can keep using the apps without any worry.

 Spark ramps up its Internet of Things (IoT) network with a leading investment in Kiwi tech company Parkable.  
Auckland-based startup Parkable has raised more than $4.6 million in its first funding round led by telecommunications giant Spark. The funds will be used to increase Parkable’s international expansion and continue developing its technology and product. Currently, the company operates throughout New Zealand, Australia and most recently in China. 
Aimed at making the most of unused parking spaces in cities, Parkable is a sharing economy platform that allows companies and individuals to rent out their empty parking bays. Customers who need parking can then find and book these spaces via the Parkable app. 
Spark, which is understood to have contributed a significant amount to the $4.6 million raised, sees Parkable as a key addition to its increasing role in the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT devices are internet-connected devices that ‘talk’ to each other, also referred to as ‘smart devices’. The rise of IoT has been a major factor in fueling the race for 5G which promises a more IoT friendly ecosystem.
“[Spark] has built this brand new shiny IoT network and now they want things to put on it, and we’re a commoditised solution for car parking that they can sell,” says Brody Nelson, Parkable co-founder and chief technology officer. “We’ve got a few different sensors and one of them is an in-bay sensor that detects whether the vehicle is present or absent. It’s a magnetometer that can be connected to Spark’s IoT network.”
He says most IoT solutions to date have been bespoke whereas Parkable targets a tangible pain point for many corporations  – parking – adding further value to Spark’s IoT network. In turn, Parkable will have access to Spark’s vast array of corporate and small and medium-sized business customers. 
“We see parking as a key vertical in our IoT segment and this is a strategic investment for us,” says Renee Mataparae, Spark’s Future of Connectivity lead. “The Parkable platform offers a unique value proposition in this space for our customers across many industries. It truly demonstrates one of the early use-cases for IoT technology – providing a valuable service for consumers and businesses alike and allowing for better asset utilisation.”
Earlier this year, Parkable launched into Australia after buying Park Genie, a smaller parking technology company in Brisbane, following a previous funding round involving Spark and NZ Venture Investment Fund. Recently it launched in Shanghai as part of a joint venture with Chinese investors. 
“We believe our Parkable for Business product is the best corporate parking optimisation solution in the world,” says Toby Littin, Parkable co-founder and CEO. “We want to push that very hard now, both in our existing markets in New Zealand, Australia and China, and in new markets where we know there is increasing parking scarcity.”
In addition to Spark, new investors include Movio co-founder Peter Beguely and renowned tech investor Rowan Simpson. Early-stage investors and advisory board members Jason Kilgour and David Brain have both increased their holdings. The Spinoff’s managing editor Duncan Greive is also a shareholder.

A friend recently called me a super woman, and maybe the title fits: I am a super commuter, joined by about 29,000 others who commute 90 minutes or more each way to Silicon Valley every day.
Why do I super-commute? Because I love my Silicon Valley job, but I feel at home most in Berkeley, where I discovered myself and life in all its myriad hues.
I take two trains every weekday morning–BART and Caltrain. I am lucky because work is a 15-minute walk from Mountain View’s San Antonio station. Had my office been any further from the station, I would have looked for alternatives–maybe taking a third connection in addition to my second train. But that would add another 30 minutes to my dedicated 140–minute commute. For times when I need to attend meetings outside my office, I do rely on the transit network companies–like Uber and Lyft–for my last-mile connection. And I have almost come to accept the negative implications of that choice.
The last-mile connection, the bane of our transit system, is a tough nut to crack. Transit proponents have been calling attention to the ‘death spiral’ in local transit for some time now. Periods of service cuts and fare increases impact ridership that leads to more cuts and so on. The hyper growth of Ubers and Lyfts fill that gap and while these services satisfy transit riders like me, we are well aware of the serious ways in which they challenge the system.
The transportation infrastructure in the Bay Area could not function if everyone were to commute by car, through private use or via use of services such as Lyft and Uber. But car use is increasing in the Bay Area. Both for ethical and practical reasons, we must bring our attention to commuters who can’t afford to switch to cars and are affected by several cumulative issues—including the lack of affordable housing options in job-rich areas and an inevitable dependency on an unreliable public transportation system to navigate between home and work. For these commuters, navigating everyday can be a staggering set of circumstances.
How do we improve this situation? Several organizations are building support for a 2020 regional transportation measure that would raise up to $100 billion to ease transportation gridlock across the nine-county region. Those involved in these efforts include business and civic institutions affiliated with the “Faster Bay Area” campaign, and transit advocates, labor groups and environmentalists that are coalescing under the “Visions for Public Transportation” umbrella.
Here’s just one way a regional transportation funding measure could help: We need straightforward improvements in local bus operations that, for instance, can make transit frequent enough to help a high school student attend after school programs or help a senior to get to the local grocery store. More than 2 million young, elderly and disabled people ride transit in our region. In addition, local bus improvements could reduce occasional reliance on cars for 100,000 workers like me who usually take mass transit.
Whether one is a super-commuter or not, it’s clear to all Bay Area residents that we need an intentional, coordinated, regional effort to improve our buses, trains, light rail and bikeways to allow people to move between home, work and school more efficiently in the decades to come. And we need an ongoing source of funding for these improvements.
My organization, Silicon Valley Community Foundation, along with our nonprofit partners TransForm and Urban Habitat, recently convened a forum at which experts from the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Seattle–two cities that have passed similarly large-scale-regional transportation measures–discussed relevant lessons for the Bay Area.
One consistent theme throughout was for the measure to prioritize equity for lower-income residents and people with disabilities through affordable and reliable transportation choices. To quote a panelist, Thea Selby of SF Transit Riders: “Freedom of movement is a human right.” Both Los Angeles and Seattle prioritized bus operations and keeping fares low amidst other capital-intensive investments. A high-quality, accessible transportation system that reduced carbon emissions was a necessary component. But it was equally crucial that the system support the economic security of low-income people by providing access to good paying jobs.
The revenue source for the measure–currently a point of contention among the campaigners–tests our commitment to put equity in the center of several considerations within the regional transportation measure. Sales tax has historically been a primary revenue source in successful transportation measures over the years–including Los Angeles’ Measure M and Seattle’s ST3 as well–but sales tax is regressive. It by nature takes a larger proportion from the incomes of low-wage earners than from high-income people. The general public often misses this inherent inequity. Are there other alternatives for funding Bay Area transportation?
Ultimately, as in L.A. and Seattle, we will need a strong coalition both to win a campaign and implement the broader vision. Both the “Faster” and the “Visions for Public Transportation” campaigns must continue to seek compromise and alignment on several issues, including the extent to which funding will rely on progressive or regressive revenue sources.
The writer Toni Morrison talked about the need to engage in “constructive conflict,” one that “recognizes legitimate oppositions, honest but different interpretations of data, contesting theories” in order to win democratic struggles. I get up every morning to complete my “super commute” to do precisely that, engage in that conflict. I am happy about my role in advancing efforts to convene diverse stakeholder perspectives. I am not happy if I am complicit in thwarting mobility choices for people who are silently suffering. Improving regional transportation is a unique opportunity.
 But we will not win a regional transportation measure in 2020 without considering the needs of the most severely impacted groups. We will win this democratic struggle only when we stand together with them.

Hyundai has become the first car manufacturer to buy into Uber’s dream of fleets of flying taxis flitting above the cities of the world with the unveiling of its first concept at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
Uber and Hyundai Motor Company announced a new partnership to develop Uber Air Taxis for a future aerial ride share network at the show, along with the new full-scale aircraft concept – the S-A1.
According to the two companies, Hyundai will produce and deploy the air vehicles, while Uber will provide airspace support services, connections to ground transportation, and customer interfaces through an aerial ride share network. Both parties are collaborating on infrastructure concepts to support take-off and landing for this new class of vehicles.
“Our vision of Urban Air Mobility will transform the concept of urban transportation,” said Jaiwon Shin, Executive Vice President and Head of Hyundai’s Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Division.
“We expect UAM to vitalise urban communities and provide more quality time to people. We are confident that Uber Elevate is the right partner to make this innovative product readily available to as many customers as possible.”
The S-A1 is designed for a cruising speed up to 290 km/h, a cruising altitude of around 300 to 600 metres above ground, and to fly trips up to 100 km. It will be 100 per cent electric and Hyundai says that during peak hours will require about five to seven minutes for recharging.
It uses “distributed electric propulsion”, powering multiple rotors and propellers around the airframe that it says increases safety by decreasing any single point of failure. Having several, smaller rotors also reduces noise relative to large rotor helicopters with combustion engines, which is obviously rather important in  cities.
The S-A1 is designed to take off vertically, transition to wing-borne lift in cruise, and then transition back to vertical flight to land. The cabin is designed with four passenger seats, allowing riders to board and disembark easily and avoid the dreaded middle seat with enough space for a personal bag or backpack. Hyundai says it will be piloted initially, but over time they will become autonomous.
“Hyundai is our first vehicle partner with experience of manufacturing passenger cars on a global scale,” said Eric Allison, head of Uber Elevate.
“We believe Hyundai has the potential to build Uber Air vehicles at rates unseen in the current aerospace industry, producing high quality, reliable aircraft at high volumes to drive down passenger costs per trip. Combining Hyundai’s manufacturing muscle with Uber’s technology platform represents a giant leap forward for launching a vibrant air taxi network in the coming years,” 
Bloomberg has reported that, while Uber has held talks with the US Federal Aviation Administration, the whole flying taxi thing is likely to face heavy scrutiny from the regulator over logistics for takeoff and landing, noise and safety concerns.
And that is not even getting into the whole autonomous thing, although neither Hyundai nor Uber have provided a timeline for dispensing with human pilots.

A WAY to ease your household budget or pay for that next holiday might be right under you nose … or in your driveway to be more precise. Car Next Door has been dubbed the “AirBnB of cars” giving owners the chance to make some extra cash while they aren’t using their vehicle.
Car sharing services have been around for a number of years but their growing popularity is proving to be a boon for users.

According to the car sharing service the average users makes about $7000 a year but some are making triple that amount. One such user is Karl Schaffarczyk from Melbourne who in under a year has earned about $20,000 from renting out his Mitsubishi Outlander plug-in hybrid SUV.
The lawyer from the inner Melbourne suburb of Carlton has little need for his car on a daily basis so decided to rent it out to make some extra cash.

His car is rented out for under $10 an hour or under $50 for a full day. And business is booming as he explains the car is rarely at home.“Most people rent it out for a few hours and but some have it for a full month,” says Schaffarczyk. “This Easter will be the first time I’ve used my car in a year.”
But despite the perceived inconveniences of never having the vehicle you own available Schaffarczyk isn’t phased.  “I’m very flexible. The way I view it my car is out earning money and if I have a sudden need for a car I have a membership with Car Next Door and two other similar schemes. In that time I’ve borrowed other people’s cars twice.” he says.

“So I’m never short of a car. And I find public transport significantly less stressful than driving around.” Schaffarczyk believes that more people should join car sharing schemes and doesn’t subscribe to the conventional model of car ownership.
“Car ownership for just car ownership in inner Melbourne is just insane.” “The way I see it I have a part time job vacuuming my car that pays quite well. My car has had earnings and it paid for me to go to Germany and Ireland while still making me money.”
But there are always a few trade-offs says Schaffarczyk. The rego for his vehicle went up by about 50 per cent to about $1400 and he does get the odd speeding fine sent his way which he then has to pass on.
But the main complaint that he and his renters have is the trouble parking the vehicle. Which on a Friday or Saturday night around Carlton can take hours.
Schaffarczyk explains that while other car share businesses have Melbourne City Council allocated spots Car Next Door isn’t allowed to be parked in those spots.
The company expects about 1.5 million Australians to be using car sharing by 2023. Car Next Door’s boss Will Davies believes that car sharing could be a congestion buster.
“The key here is changing the ‘one person, one car’ mentality – we need to make the whole network perform better and that might also mean rewarding people who are willing to share cars or not drive in peak times,” says Davies.
“Research shows that cars sit idle for 96 per cent of the time, the waste involved with that is enormous. There needs to be a real incentive to make use of the resources we already have.”
And it is sure to make solid financial sense because according to the Australian Automobile Association the average Australian household spends about $18,000 a year on transport costs. A big part of these costs are owning a vehicle and its associated costs such as depreciation, fuel, insurance and rego.
Car makers are getting on board too. Hyundai is integrating Car Next Door bookings into its next-gen infotainment technology making it easier for owners to rent out their vehicles.

Samsung Electronics Co. will supply 5G-based telematics control unit (TCU) co-developed with its wholly owned subsidiary Harman to Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) to empower connectivity to the German brand’s all-electric sport utility vehicle iNEXT rolling out next year.
BMW’s iNEXT would be the world’s first vehicle fitted with a 5G-supported TCU, said Samsung Electronics on Wednesday when it first showcased its 5G TCU technology at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) held in Las Vegas. This is also the Korean tech giant’s first 5G TCU order.
The company did not disclose contract details including the financial term.
The 5G-based TCU collects and provides real-time data for connected car services. Drivers and passengers can download high-resolution contents and maps in real time and join video conferences on roads.
Various in-vehicle antennas are integrated into a new conformal antenna, replacing the shark fin antenna on top of the car roof, according to the company.
Samsung has already secured two more orders, said Park Jong-hwan, executive vice president and head of automotive components team in Samsung Electronics. “Harman could be the front leader in 5G TCU,” Park added.
Samsung Electronics has already applied its latest TCU to Seoul city buses and taxis in partnership with the country’s leading wireless company SK Telecom to test the system.
Harman’s revenue from the automotive component division has been growing by about 10 percent a year, Park revealed. Orders have exceeded $1 billion a year, Park added.
Harman anticipates bigger double-digit number in revenue growth from the automotive component division in 2022-2023.
Samsung Electronics supplies Harman car audio to luxury brand Genesis’ first SUV model GV80 at home. In April, it announced it has become an official supplier of digital cockpits to Chinese EV maker Beijing Electric Vehicle (BJEV).

The participating employees will ride in Pony.ai autonomous vehicles from Fremont’s Amtrak/ACE Station to City Hall and City of Fremont Development Services Center.
Fremont Mayor Lily Mei says: “By partnering with a local autonomous technology firm Pony.ai, the City of Fremont is acting as a test bed for a transportation solution that has the potential to alleviate congestion, reduce carbon emissions, decrease the number of traffic accidents, and optimize vehicle and land usage.
Each vehicle is equipped with Pony.ai’s autonomous driving technology along with a safety operator to ensure safe and smooth navigation of complex road scenarios.
Pony.ai’s proprietary full-stack autonomous driving technology serves as the “brains” of the future vehicle, and will be a building block to the future Smart City.
The Fremont Mobility Action Plan, adopted in March 2019, addresses both regional and local traffic congestion challenges and outlines the goal of decreasing drive-alone commuting from 73 per cent to 50 per cent by 2040.
The Pony.ai pilot program is one solution the City is exploring to help meet this goal and serve the internal travel demands of Fremont’s growing population of 230,000 residents.
James Peng, CEO of Pony.ai, says: “In the long term, Pony.ai aims to offer a service that not only addresses the community’s daily transit needs, but also serves as a key enabler to a broader smart city infrastructure in Fremont and beyond.
“With our autonomous driving technology, we will facilitate business activity and create economic value for the broader region, as well as contribute to a safe and congestion-free transportation environment.”
Currently, Pony.ai vehicles operate daily across the globe, from Fremont and Irvine, California, to Beijing and Guangzhou in China.
In 2018, Pony.ai became the first company to roll out daily robotaxi operations in China; last year, Pony.ai also became the first company to launch a public robotaxi service in California.

As cities around the world move toward greater mobility, different transportation modes are being introduced, offering commuters more options to help get them to where they need to be. One such mode that has rapidly gained popularity around the globe in recent years is the electric scooter (e-scooter), often in the form of scooter-sharing startups. The trend is generating plenty of buzz, as well as concern.
Recently, scooter-sharing systems have been introduced in some parts of Thailand. Wander around Thong Lor and Ekamai today, and you’ll see orange e-scooters outside BTS stations and in front of cafes and restaurants. Increasingly, someone on a scooter will cruise past you on the pavement.
Neuron, a scooter-sharing company based in Singapore, introduced its line of orange e-scooters in Chiang Mai late last year.
The company expanded its service to Thammasat University (Rangsit campus) in January, before coming to Bangkok in May. In the capital, the service area started out in Thong Lor before expanding from Asok to On Nut BTS stations, and Phetchaburi to Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre MRT stations. Collectively called the Thong Lor zone, Neuron provides around 200 e-scooters in this area. It is reported that users take approximately 500-600 trips daily within the zone.
The service comes with an app, and geo-fence and GPS tracking in each dockless scooter. Designated parking spots can be located using the in-app map. Neuron also employs staff to go around the area collecting scooters, replacing batteries and ensuring abandoned scooters don’t end up dumped together in ugly clutters.
“It’s not about simply buying scooters and placing them on the street. We look at it in terms of city planning too, as well as incorporating technology to keep things safe while helping with the smart city initiative,” said Nate Chanchareon, Neuron Mobility’s head of business development.
To avail of the service, users have to download the app and scan a QR code on the scooter. Then they just hop on and ride. The pay-per-ride rates start from 20 baht, with an additional 1 baht per minute. Daily, weekly and monthly rates are available. The scooters can reach speeds of 20-25km/h. Basic insurance is provided, helmets are not.
Nate said feedback from commuters has been positive. In Chiang Mai, many use it for tourism and leisure purposes. Within the university campus, students ride scooters from dorm to class, as well as for recreation. In Bangkok, the scooters are mainly being used for commuting purposes, connecting from the BTS/MRT to the home or workplace, providing a solution to the first-mile/last-mile (FMLM) connection problem, an attractive alternative to motorcycle taxis, taxis or walking.
“Consider any given Friday. The traffic is heavy.
Some people may not want to ride on a motorcycle. Scooters can then be a faster option than cars and cheaper than a taxi for the first-mile/last-mile connection. They’re suitable for commuting short distances. The more options there are, the better they help ease the traffic,” said Nate. As they run on electricity, the scooters are also more eco-friendly.
Outside of Thailand, Neuron also provides scooter-sharing services in Singapore and Cyberjaya in Malaysia, and will be heading to Brisbane and Darwin in Australia soon.
Globally, scooter-sharing services have experienced strong growth since 2017, starting in Europe before making their way to the US and now Asia. However, despite the benefits, there are concerns over safety. According to Nate, some minor injuries have been reported from people falling over while using the scooters. There still is risk, of course, which Nate describes as “similar to riding a bicycle”.
Everywhere reacts to the arrival of e-scooters differently. For example, the Queensland authority issued regulations on helmets and speed limits. Riders can use footpaths only, not bike lanes or roads. In some locations, such regulations are not enough, with people seeking to ban the scooters altogether.
In Thailand, scooter-sharing is still in its infancy. While its usage is steadily growing, there are as yet no clear regulations in place. Assoc Prof Pawinee Iamtrakul, from the Faculty of Architecture and Planning at Thammasat University, says the use of scooters can be safe as long as regulations are in place.
“In a closed area like a university campus, which you don’t need to share with other vehicles, it’s quite safe to use scooters. But in other areas, it could be dangerous,” she said. “The state is the best entity to decide which zones could be used for sharing. They know what should and shouldn’t be allowed. In the end, we don’t want anyone to be in danger.”
This goes both ways. Users have to be educated on how to safely operate the scooters, and on which areas are safe to travel in. This will make it easier for the state to step in and impose appropriate regulations ensuring minimal disruption and maximum safety.
In Bangkok, authorities have been redoubling their efforts to clear the pavements for pedestrians by banning motorcycles and vendor carts. Is it ideal to throw scooters into the mix? Plus the precarious state of the city’s footpaths, already broken up and uneven, create difficulties for pedestrians. Surely scooters are not well suited to such terrain.
Pawinee believes it’s up to different sectors to come together and manage the sharing of space. If sections of footpaths can be cleared and then properly designated as areas for scooters and other mobility devices, she says, it could be beneficial to all, including pedestrians, senior citizens and people with disabilities.
“People have different limitations. Scooters are one option that can help them travel longer distances. It’ll be helpful to improve basic infrastructure to accommodate a diversity of users for greater connectivity, accessibility and safety,” she said.
Additionally, she argues, e-scooters can be used to promote tourism and help local economies.
Despite the controversies and uncertainties that surround scooter-sharing, both Nate and Pawinee are confident that they have the potential to grow.
“As long as Thailand continues to have road traffic problems, people will seek alternatives,” said Nate. “If there’s a more reliable, faster, maybe even cheaper option, people will use it. In Bangkok, the infrastructure isn’t bad in all areas. There are places that may be good for using scooters.
However, he pointed out, the pavements and bike lanes must be improved, and clear regulations put in place.
“It’s not just about business but also community,” he says. “We can strive for sustainable goals and be environmentally friendly. So, if more people learn to accommodate the scooters, it should help make Thailand more liveable. With safety concerns, we can put them on the table: let’s see what the problems are and try to solve them.
“Bangkok already has an established transit backbone in the shape of the MRT and BTS. The next thing to do is address first-mile/last-mile connections; improve them by providing more options, be they bicycles, scooters or something else. Set up designated lanes and make them safe. If we can do this, I think people would rely less on personal cars.”
Pawinee also underlined the importance of connectivity between small, medium and large transit modes. These should be designed to feed into each other seamlessly for added convenience and safety.
“Today, many people feel that using their own car is more convenient than using public transportation … With new options and development, they should be able to create a better society, beyond just commuting,” she said.
BANGKOK TEST RIDE
It was pretty scary trying an e-scooter for the first time in Bangkok. The sight of uneven pavements, random manholes, pedestrians, vendor carts, trees, utility poles, motorcycles and everything else that clutter the city’s sidewalks and sois suggested an unpleasant ride. But to my surprise, the experience was much more pleasant than I’d anticipated.
I recently dropped by BTS Phrom Phong station to give the scooters a shot. My destination was Donki Mall, Thong Lor 10. As I’d already downloaded the application and linked my credit card, I was ready to go. A Neuron staff member who was checking on the scooters outside the station, gave me some basic instructions on how to operate the scooter and use the app.
Then I was off. Even for a first-timer, the scooter was easy to ride. The real challenge was to avoid all of obstacles and get to my destination in one piece. Sure enough, it proved to be difficult terrain. I spent half the time riding and the other half pulling and lifting the heavy scooter. I was drenched with sweat by the time I got to my destination, almost half an hour later, a distance of 3.4km. I paid 45 baht. Comparatively, the same trip using the Grab motorcycle taxi service is 48 baht and over 75 baht for a Grab taxi.
It was quite a tiring ride. But on the occasions when the pavement was long and obstacle-free, it was actually pretty fun zipping along on the scooter. The potential of this transportation mode is quite clear. I can see it becoming a practical and convenient option in places with better infrastructure and terrain. In Bangkok, it’s really crucial to take precautions and watch where we’re going. Another added plus is that I passed by some interesting local shops that I never really noticed when driving a car.

IN THE not-too-distant future you could ride one, two or three wheels… or maybe none at all.
Tech-inspired solutions for mobility – on land, air and water – featured prominently at the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) last week.
Some innovators played with long-established ideas like the bicycle or scooter by adding artificial intelligence, electric power and other technologies.
Autonomous and shared vehicles intended to curb traffic and emissions were front and centre.
Swiss-based group Rinspeed showed its latest “modular mobility” vehicle Metrosnap, which is built on a skateboard-like chassis and looks like a futuristic minibus. Different components can be swapped in to accommodate passengers, deliveries or even a mobile retail outlet.
Germany’s Bosch showed a similar autonomous shuttle bus-style vehicle that can offer “customised on-demand mobility”.
Juergen Reers, a mobility analyst with Accenture, said people are looking for flexible solutions.
“People want something more than (transit) where they are tied to rigid schedules and pickup stations,” he said.
Pedal power, with extras
Adaptations of the bicycle, infused with new tech for the connected generation, appeared at CES.
French startup Wello showed its open-sided, three-wheeled car-bike that relies on pedalling, electric power and solar panels on the roof, already in use by French postal services.
“It’s taking the best from the bicycle and the best from the car,” said Arnaud Chereau, co-founder of the group, which is based in Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean.
“It’s 100 per cent sustainable because it produces energy from the solar panels.” Also seen at the show was an off-road electric cargo bike from Sweden-based startup Cake, which riders can customise for various kinds of trips.
“You can commute to work, pick up your groceries and then grab your surfboard and head to the beach,” Cake spokesman Garin Fons said of the two-wheeler.
Another electric-assisted tricycle concept from Italian startup Measy adds another dimension: A cargo bay for a small delivery robot that can be set free to bring goods inside buildings.
“This is a concept for multimobility,” said Measy engineer Matta De Santis, demonstrating with a robot from fellow Italian startup Yape.
China-based Smacircle offered a simpler, lighter electric bicycle designed as two small, connected rings that fold up and fit a backpack or commuter case.
“If you take a train to work, you can use this for the first mile or last mile,” said Smacircle’s Darren Pike of the e-bike, which is only 53 centimetres high and weighs just over 10 kilos.
Some models presented a more outlandish way to get from A to B.
Ninebot Segway, which makes personal transporters and scooters, unveiled its S-Pod, a self-balancing armchair designed for urban streets.
“We are looking at different solutions for urban mobility,” said company spokesman Julie Tang.
According to Segway, the new personal transport pod can travel up to 39 kilometers an hour and is designed with intuitive controls to avoid tipping over.
New Zealand startup Manta5 presented its water bike, which also uses electricity.
The Manta5 hydrofoiler, with variable electric power assistance, is “a new category of water sport” that is quiet, environmentally friendly and allows you “to see directly into the water”, spokesman Louis Wilks said.
Some CES exhibitors said the best way to cope with traffic on the ground is to rise above it.
Aeronext unveiled a scaled-down model of its “flying gondola” designed as a personal transporter. The gondola uses so-called “4D gravity” to keep the passenger compartment stable even during turbulence.
“This is original technology. Conventional air mobility drones are not stable,” said Keisuke Toji, chief executive of the group, which has offices in Japan and China.
South Korea’s Hyundai meanwhile announced it would begin mass-producing flying cars for Uber, moving the idea of aerial robo-taxis closer to reality.
Putting it all together
The vast array of new transport options could lead to a more sustainable future, but only if coordinated, said Accenture’s Mr Reers.
Hyundai proposed a network of hubs to connect various forms of personal and mass transit with stations for its drones.
Toyota said it would create a “woven city” in Japan, powered by hydrogen fuel cells, where it would test autonomous driving and related technologies.
At the moment, Mr Reers said cities have resisted new modes of transport like scooters because they don’t fit into the ecosystem, highlighting the need for better planning.
“These new developments create huge opportunities to manage the system in a more sustainable way,” he said. AFP

The “last mile problem” was first described in terms of telephone wires – the most costly lines were the ones that served the individual homes. According to Stigo of the Urban Travel Blog, it then became popular in shipping circles, referring to the cost of delivering goods. It’s a big deal right now, as Amazon tries to deliver all those Prime Day orders.
But the last mile problem that directly affects most of us is the way we get home or to the office, the last little bit that we do on our own. It was relatively easy with a car, which could travel in a driveway as easily as on the highway. But as Stigo notes, that is not always so simple.

The last mile problem, at its core, is quite a simple one — public transport doesn’t take us exactly where we need to go, parking is not always available everywhere we go, owning a car or any kind of vehicle is not always possible or even reasonable. And walking is not always the quickest or the most convenient way to move around the city.

Today, everybody is trying to solve the last mile problem with all kinds of new technologies. Most people know about the e-scooters purported to be begriming cities, But there are lots of others; David Pierce of the Wall Street Journal recently tried a few of them as a solution to the last-mile problem.

To qualify as a last-mile vehicle, at least by my criteria, a device has to be light enough to carry up a flight of stairs and small enough to stash under a cafe table. It has to be easy enough to ride that you can traverse a crowded street without injuring yourself or some unlucky pedestrian. Its battery should last at least 10 miles, ideally enough to get through your commute and a meeting or two. Last, and maybe most important, it has to get you where you’re going without leaving you sweaty. Bikes, while obviously great commuting vehicles, don’t count as last-mile vehicles. Even electric bikes force you to work a little, and they are too big and heavy to carry into your meeting.

So, instead, he tries scooters, boards, Segways, some crazy skates, and his favorite, a OneWheel Pint, a strange device that he calls the unicycle of boards.







I have this theory that eventually all the scooter companies will improve their products’ durability and stability by adding bigger wheels, a seat and pedals. https://twitter.com/mtsw/status/1149196298047741952 …

They’re getting very close but the scooters that are solid enough for a fast comfortable ride are still pretty clunky























Bird is launching an electric moped this summer
Up to 50 miles per charge, but no word on pricing or top speed
theverge.com








I am not convinced about all these little electric alternatives. Wheels give you stability, pedals give you additional power, and bike share systems let you travel short distances. I think that Doug is right, that in the end they will all evolve into some form of bicycle. And furthermore, what is wrong with having to work a little? Why do you have something moving you every second, every foot you travel? Even Pierce comes around to this eventually.








Want to look not entirely uncool? The skateboard has the most street cred among this nerdy crowd. Need maximum portability? Pray for new, better skates. Is your only goal to go as far as possible, as fast as possible? None of these devices can outrun the Boosted Rev [electric scooter]. But if you’re already going that bulky, maybe an electric bike like the $2,998 VanMoof Electrified X2 or the $1,298 Wing Freedom is your best bet.

But everybody already owns the best solution for the last-mile problem, and most people are quite capable of using them: feet.
A hundred years ago everyone was building streetcar suburbs, communities based around the idea that you could take a streetcar to the Main Street nearest your home and walk the last 20 minutes, roughly a mile, to your door. There are few offices in cities like New York or London that are more than a 20 minute walk from decent transit. People knew, when they were planning their day, to budget 20 minutes to walk to the streetcar.
E-scooters are a lot of fun, but ultimately, good sidewalks and safe pedestrian infrastructure are the best solutions to the last-mile problem. Bikes can solve the last three-mile problem, e-bikes perhaps the last ten-mile problem, and they need their own safe and separate infrastructure.
Get your urban design right, and you don’t actually have a last-mile problem – and you don’t need electric skates.

Disclaimer: I’m a product manager at Uber. This piece represents my views only, and not those of people working on behalf of Uber.
A wave of electric scooters and bikes has been taking over American cities in the past year. People have been dismissing them as toys (which alone should tickle your interest) or a fad. But there’s a lot more to them than that, and I’d go as far as to say that I’m more excited about the potential 20 years impact of micromobility on cities than I am about that of self-driving cars.
Like autonomous vehicles, electric bikes and scooters are an order of magnitude cleaner and safer than human-driven cars. But unlike self-driving cars, they also bring order of magnitude improvements in space and energy efficiency, on top of being very cheap. And we can deploy them today.
Any single one of these improvements would be a game changer in and of itself, the kind that car companies would spend billions to pursue. Bundled together, they’re an innovation like we see only once a century.
1. Cleaner and more energy efficient
I hope we agree that global warming is a Really Big Deal — probably the one biggest issue we’re facing as a civilization. I’m not saying that scooters are a silver bullet for it. But they’re a big part of the solution. Transportation represents 28% of greenhouse gas emissions, and micromobility can shave a big chunk off of that by eating the sub-2 miles trips making up 40% of urban rides (source).
The reason, in short, is that these new modes are electric and super lightweight. Internal combustion engines are only 35% efficient, losing the rest in heat. Then, only 5% of that energy go into moving the passenger — the other 95% move the car.
So, the overall efficiency of a car is 0.05 * 0.35 = 1.75%. This means that for every gallon you pour into your tank, only 2 ounces are used to move you. The rest is either lost in heat or used to move your car.
Compare that to electric scooters, which convert 85% of their energy into movement and weigh around 30lbs, making their overall energy efficiency over 70%.
Again, car companies would kill to improve their cars’ efficiency by 10%. Here, we’re talking of a 4000% improvement.
2. More space efficient
You may have seen these images highlighting the abysmal space-inefficiency of cars.

This is how much space 60 people take when they drive, walk, bike, or ride a bus.
This is what I find hilarious in people complaining about scooters “taking too much space.” It’s a typical case of what Bastiat calls “The Seen and the Unseen.” You see the space the scooter takes, but not that saved by replacing a car. If you care about space, you should love bikes and scooters.
I know, scooters are sometimes in the middle of the sidewalk, and cars aren’t. But that’s easily solvable by building more bike racks and dedicated parking spaces, which cities are starting to do.
These new vehicles don’t save space only by being smaller. They also allow riders to keep a shorter safety distance between each other. By some estimates, these 2 factors combined result in traffic bandwidth that’s up to 10x greater.






This makes micromobility the one most compelling solution to our traffic problems. And to illustrate how big of a problem it is: a 2015 study by the Texas A&M Transportation institute and INRIX finds that (emphasis mine)







In 2014, congestion caused urban Americans to travel an extra 6.9 billion hoursand purchase an extra 3.1 billion gallons of fuel for a congestion cost of $160 billion.

To put these numbers in perspective:

6.9 billion hours is roughly 9,000 lives, or the equivalent of three 9/11s per year
$160 billion is 0.8% of the American GDP
3.1 billion gallons are 2.1% of the country’s yearly fuel consumption

I may already have said it, but this is a very big deal. Solving this traffic problem alone is worth investing dozens of billions of dollars. Talking about micromobility, you find yourself mentioning this kind of perk just in passing, as one of your 5 bullet points.
3. Safer
Now, I know this one may be a bit contentious — I too read the articles about bike fatalities. But here’s how I see the situation: someone’s riding their bike, a car kills them, and people view the bike as the problem.
I brought together this very scientific table to describe the real problem.

If we reserved a whole neighborhood to bikes only, or just built a lot of bike lanes in it, I guarantee the accidents rate would go way down. In fact, The Netherlands ran the experiment. Can you guess from the chart below when it started building bike lanes everywhere?
 
Source: Statistics Netherlands
Yes, the early 70s, after which road fatalities decreased from 3500+ in 1971 (including 400+ children) to 640 in 2010 (including 12 children). That’s a reduction of 82% in overall fatalities and of 97% in children fatalities (children are overrepresented in road fatalities since drivers can’t see them).
This is why I think that accelerating the adoption of micromobility is more than an exciting business opportunity — it’s a moral imperative. If we can save dozens of thousands of lives every year just by building a ton of bike lanes, what are we waiting for?
4. Making the world city a better place
I know it’s become cliché in Silicon Valley to say that you’re #ChangingTheWorld. I think one big reason why people roll their eyes when they hear this is that it’s often said by companies working in the “world of bits.” Not that there’s anything wrong with these businesses, I do believe they’re impactful. But they remain these abstract entities “in the cloud,” pictures behind the glass in your pocket.
Transportation companies are different. They’re actually deeply rooted in the real world — in atoms.
If you tell me you’ll change the world, and then you give me a better compression algorithm, I’ll be like “yeah I kinda see it if I squint really hard.” But I won’t need to squint if you tell me you’ll change the world, and then you go on to save thousands of lives per year; give back to everyone the hours per week they’d have spent in traffic; decrease greenhouse gas emissions by a double-digit percent; and turn American cities into, like, utopian Smurf villages.
(In general, I do believe innovation in the world of bits is overrated, and innovation in the world of atoms underrated. But that’s for another essay.)
And to illustrate the depth of the impact I’m talking about; behold these comparisons of the same Danish streets, before and after they reserved them to bikes and pedestrians. That’s what changing the world looks like — in less than 30 years.
Historical pictures from the Amsterdam Archives. Recent ones by Thomas Schlipjer.
These changes are not just aesthetic. They also have a deep impact on local economies — increasing footfall and the revenue of local businesses. This in turn also translates in higher real estate value in these neighborhoods.
(To read more about the impact of micromobility on local economies, check out Lawlor 2014’s “The business case for better streets and places”.)
This impact makes intuitive sense. Cities are about communities. And cars are about isolating you and putting you in your own bubble. Innovation in the car industry consists in making this bubble as thick as possible: better noise isolation, better suspensions, better speakers…
Micromobility vehicles are the contrary. When you ride a scooter, you’re not isolated — you’re in the city. Driving a car is boring — that’s why we’re trying to automate it. Riding a bike is fun — even more so when it’s electric! (It’s hard to convey this to people who’ve never tried it, but the experience of riding a pedal-assist bike truly is exhilarating.)
I find it funny that Americans visit Europe and extol its charming, lively streets, and then go back home to build the same sprawling suburbs where one needs to drive just to go grab breakfast.
This is one common thing disappointing tourists in the US. They expect to see a big metropolis with skyscrapers everywhere, shops open 24/7, and tons of life in the streets. When they arrive, they rapidly find out that there isn’t much Manhattan in the US, apart from, well, Manhattan.
Go to Houston, Denver or Salt Lake City — even their city centers during week-ends are mostly dead. My favorite example of all is Los Angeles, which in John Lennon’s words is just a “parking lot where you can buy a hamburger for the trip to San Francisco.”
Going around American cities as a pedestrian, one feels like a second-class citizen. The cities were visibly designed for cars, with pedestrians a mere afterthought — when they’re lucky to be a thought at all. The absence of visual diversity makes walking boring, of any shade structure unhealthy, and of places to seat painfully clear that one is not supposed to hang around for too long, like giant signs saying “move along, nothing to see!”
Cities used to be living places. Cars turned most of them into dead spaces instead, with tiny islands of life here and there. I find it unbelievable that we’ve come to see this as the only possible option, and exhilarating to contribute in changing this.
5. Micromobility as a force for economic inclusion
People need transportation options to access earning opportunities, mainly located in unaffordable cities. Today, the cheapest option is public transportation. But there remains a “last mile” problem: how is one to access the nearest station when it’s sometimes miles away? Solving this will need an option with much greater traffic density than public transportation, at a much lower price than cars. Micromobility fits the bill perfectly.
This must be why these new modes of transportation are so overwhelmingly popular amongst lower income groups, as suggested by this survey of 7,000 people by Populus Group in their report on micromobility.


“It’ll never work in America”
When I make these points, people often tell me that that’s all well and good, but could never happen in the US. “American cities were just designed around cars — we’d have to rebuild the whole country to change this!”
But cities like Amsterdam, too, were re-designed for cars in the first half of the 20th Century, leading to a sharp increase in road fatalities and decrease in bike ridership.
This engendered the fierce activism of the “Stop the Child Murder” movement in the 1970s (“Stop Der Kindermoor”). People took the streets, blocked wide arteries with bicycles, and pressured politicians to build more bike lanes.
Politicians eventually folded, and the impact was significant. Bike ridership nearly doubled in just a couple of years, showing that the reason why people stopped biking was not that they didn’t want to (even in a country with as cold and wet a weather as The Netherlands). It’s just that we wouldn’t let them.
It did not take rebuilding the whole city — just building bike lanes, lots and lots of bike lanes. Neither did it take decades for it to start bearing fruits — just a couple of years.
There is no reason why the same change could not happen in the US. The capital is there. The talent is there. And the capacity for change is there. Look at how fast gay marriage became legal — from 0 states supporting it in 2001 to all 50 of them in 2013. Or look at marijuana, which may be getting legal even faster.
If you’d asked people in 2000, who would have thought that these two things would have happened so quickly? I know I wouldn’t. And I think the US will surprise us again, this time in how quickly and drastically it’s going to reshape its cities in the next 20 years.

The worldwide energy depletion crisis and the ongoing climate change calls for an immediate global transition to renewable energy alternatives such as the EV technology. The Indian government has recently announced its plan to build an EV charging station after every three km in its bid to realize its dream of ushering an all-electric transition by the year 2030. These are constructive steps undertaken by the government policymakers and the automobile sector in order to steer a nationwide shift to the EV technology.
Since no individual can bring about such a massive change on their own, it is up to the key stakeholders of the EV ecosystem such as the government, the automobile industry and EV mobility fleet owners to bring about such a massive paradigm shift from traditional modes of mobility to the unconventional.
The automobile sector can initiate this transitional process through the following ways:

The auto industry should institute technologies that improve battery life and performance, decrease the overall ownership cost, optimize other peripheral costs and help gain better ROI.
The government should ensure standardization for the battery charging infrastructure and the battery swapping mechanism in order to create a uniform EV ecosystem 
Local production of essential EV components is much needed in order to tackle the otherwise massive import costs.
To create an environment that allows for a greater adoption of the battery swapping technology as it cuts down the waiting period for charging, diminishes the size and volume of car batteries and provide a high available run-time.

Presently the latest technological developments such as Data sciences, AI and the internet of things (IoT) are delivering disruptive breakthroughs in the EV sector by building the foundation stone for an all-electric future. These futuristic technologies will aid in determining and improving the battery life and performance. This helps in bringing down the overall cost of usage and decreases the reliance on energy derived from coal gas and petroleum – non-renewable sources.
Startups too, can play an esteemed role in contributing towards the mass adoption of the EV technology by creating an enriched EV ecosystem in the following manner




The automobile giants in the country can work along with startups that are accelerating the EV transition, to boost nationwide EV adoption.
EV fleet operators and startups should inculcate data analytics within their processes as it is the next big thing in terms of improving and maximizing the growth output of any industry. The data obtained can be assessed for identifying possible anomalies and errors beforehand and therefore initiating preemptive measures and preventive preservation. Data analytics helps in approximating the present energy consumption levels; ascertaining future demands and the grid load during peak hours and recharge patterns.

As discussed previously, such an enormous shift in the way we see and interpret energy usage can only be brought forth through proactive measures on the part of the government; there are a few measures that the government must undertake to ensure nationwide permeation of the EV model. These are listed below:



ARE 5G TYRES A NEW FRONTIER IN AUTONOMOUS DRIVING?




Provide incentives for the localized development and adoption of EVs
Since India makes up for one of the largest three-wheeler markets in the world with over 0.6 million units sold in the year 2017, it is extremely important to integrate electric rickshaws in the urban electric mobility vision.
In accordance with the contemporary need and the available infrastructure, the government ought to set up at least 20 Gigafactories to produce batteries locally.
The specifications on the AC and DC chargers must serve open models of standardization.
The government should provide further monetary impetuses that promote R&D for OEMs in order to bring down the production costs and strengthen economic efficiency.
The governments at both the centre and state levels and Public Sector Units should aim to substitute their existing fleets with EVs.
The government should carve specialized lanes and reserve parking spots for EVs
The government should seek to prolong its GST cut for EVs at least till the year 2030.
The government should ensure a mass retrofit policy for the obsolete ICEs as the country moves forward towards achieving all-electric mobility.
The government must draft a direct policy that addresses the eco-friendly disposal of batteries that past their economic lifespan.

Therefore it is up to the government and other key stakeholders to draft such EV friendly policies that will help realize India’s vision of becoming an all-electric EV hub by the year 2030 and in the same context, walk shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the progressive and developed world economies.

Emergence of advanced technology has certainly benefitted the world to a great extent. In fact, nowadays, you can hardly come across any area where technology has not shown its flair. Ride-hailing service can be defined as a contemporary way of availing a private taxi for easy conveyance. This way, you don’t have to go by the age-old practice of standing at the bus depot or down the busy lane crying to the taxi driver to dole out a ride to you. 
Since the last few years, online taxi booking companies are making significant move in the transportation industry. Improving the overall experience for customers has been the major focus for these companies and they have incredibly accredited to the development of the transportation industry.
Gone are those days when the taxi driver had to stop at several junctions to pick up one or more passengers. And, this way, arriving at destinations on time used to be quite challenging for the passengers. When one would probably miss an emergency appointment with doctor, one would also lose some important business meetings to attend. 
However, with ride-hailing system on board, you no more have to go through the irksome account of waiting relentlessly just for a single ride. Also, you don’t need to deal with cash anymore. All transactions can easily be done on the respective mobile application. To gratify customers even more, they are eligible for discounts which can be availed easily by triggering their coupon codes.
According to Allied Market Research, the global ride hailing service market is expected to grow at a significant CAGR from 2018–2025.
 Surge in trend of on-demand transit services, increase in employment prospects, and considerably lower rate of car ownership among millennial crowd are the major factors fueling the growth of the market. On the other hand, truncated rate of Internet penetration in the developing counties is expected to curtail down the growth to certain extent. Nevertheless, rise in user base for shared rides has almost downplayed the restraining factor and ushered in a plethora of opportunities for the frontrunners in the industry.
There is no doubt that ride-hailing service provides passengers with the much-required comfort and ease, enabling them to assail a vehicle using several online platforms namely Uber, Ola, Uber, Grab, Lyft and many more. It not only serves as a congenial and cozy means of transportation, but also provides door-to-door services, which has made it one of the most preferred car rental choices across the world.
 At the same time, the fact that the information of the driver and the passenger gets successfully exchanged during the ride makes the service much safer and secured than any other standard taxi services. 
When you look for renting a car, you are quite likely to find a number of different options before you. When you lease a vehicle, you get to opt for exactly what type of car that you wish to rent. Moreover, when you have a long distance to cover, you have got to consider the ablation this will put on your car. 
With a rented a vehicle in use, you no longer have to worry about this scenario.
As per the report presented by Allied Market Research, the global car rental market is anticipated to grow at a considerable CAGR from 2014–2022. High-end development of tourism industry, improved road infrastructure all around the world, and investment by global players propel the growth of the market-
On the other hand, unstable price of petroleum as well as gasoline products is expected to curb the growth to some extent. However, increasing trend to use Internet has made online bookings and reservations quite hassle-free for the customers which, in turn, has almost mitigated the above factor and paved the way for several opportunities in the sector.
With excessive growth in smog level, car rental industry has come across a radical transformation over the last decade. At the same time, significant rise in population has made the industry come out as one of the most protruding trades in fleet transportation. Builders and patrons tend to count on different car rental schemes, which are lucrative as well as economical, such as hiring cars from the respective owners for a certain period of time and then tapping these vehicles on rent through app-based bookings.
 Moreover, car rentals play an important role in diminishing the volume of owned vehicles on road, thereby checking the overall pollution level to certain extent. At the same time, rise in the drift of online car booking and surge in air traffic have made car rentals an ideal option to travel, as cars are certainly the most cost-effective and faster mode of conveyance. To sum up, it can be stated that the growth of the market is snowballing at an exponential rate, and in the next few years to come, it’s going to teem up even more.

Although dozens, if not hundreds, of automotive and technology manufacturers are considering creating a self-driving car, only a handful will bring a model to production. Many concept cars are just that – concepts – with little to no chance of hitting the open road anytime soon. That’s why in summer 2019 we’ve handpicked the top companies that are currently working on a serious concept that we may one day park in our driveways.

We’ve been promised self-driving cars for a long time, but it’s only within the past decade that the technology actually started to become viable. The promise of making self-driving cars a reality has motivated nearly every automotive and technology giant to expedite the process. It’s a race to the top, and the pressure is on to become the company that will revolutionize the way we commute.
Fast moving pioneers established the expectations the public has for self-driving cars. Years of trial and error have given people a basis for what to expect – anything new that hits the market needs to exceed the expectation of previous attempts. Now that technology has developed to the point that self-driving cars can become refined, everyone has a hand in the game.
There are more than 20 companies who make or are actively attempting to make self-driving cars. A significant number of others have started implementing precursory technology, drawing speculation that they will soon begin designing their own self-driving concepts.
Notably, China is home to dozens, if not hundreds, of autonomous car companies. Unfortunately, the vast majority have yet to produce a single vehicle! On the bright side, drivers can find autonomous Chinese vehicles undergoing testing on the streets of California.
Recent Advancements in Driverless Car Technology
New developments have made the design and manufacture of self-driving cars a little easier. It’s become more evident to tech companies and automakers that the resources we have at our disposal are better than ever before. These advancements have encouraged more leaders in the automotive industry give self-driving designs a shot.
Chipmakers and Tech Giants are Getting Involved

Intel and Nvidia are household names. They’ve designed state-of-the-art chip technology for a whole host of electronics. These two major players have their hands in nearly every form of technology, and they’ve extended their reach beyond graphics cards and gaming laptops.
Intel’s innovation is centered around sensors and artificial intelligence that will allow self-driving cars to become smarter. Nvidia’s focus is primarily on artificial intelligence that learns, allowing tests of self-driving cars to produce real and measurable results with the benefit of self-correction for minor errors and new scenarios. Nvidia’s chips actively plan and strategize the same way an engaged driver would, taking self-driving tech to the next level.
Recently, Qualcomm applied for a permit to test self-driving car chip technology. They were granted that permit, but have not yet debuted the capabilities and intelligence of the chips in development.
Startups and Tech Companies are Turning to Automotive Manufacturers
In the past, Uber has experienced issues with fully automated vehicle testing. In March of 2018, a self-driving Uber vehicle manufactured by Volvo was involved in an accident where an Arizona woman was fatally injured. The collision was caused by a disabled safety feature that may have prevented the accident. The tragedy caused Uber to suspend their automated vehicle testing plans until a full investigation was conducted, and they have since resumed tests.
Uber, Lyft, Samsung, Amazon, and Bosch are all in testing phases for self-driving vehicles. These companies have an interest in monetizing their capabilities and raising their profits by reducing their labor costs. Automated delivery vehicles and ride sharing services are still a long way off, but the technology cannot be developed, tested, or approved without lengthy trial phases.
Partnerships between tech companies and automotive manufacturers are being formed every day. Any company who will ever need a car to do their work seems to be investing in the research and advancement of self-driving cars.
The Top 22 Self-Driving Car Manufacturers
While nearly every car manufacturer has expressed meaningful interest in developing self-driving cars, only a handful have made active efforts to develop their version of the concept. With so many reputable automotive brands taking competitive strides to be the first company to release the perfect self-driving car, it’s only a matter of time before the technology becomes mainstream.
Ford already manufactures self-driving cars, but they’re looking to take things to the next level. The iconic American car company is a cultural mainstay, and their presence carries a lot of weight. Ford has a loyal following, and their devoted customer base is likely to adopt whatever innovation they present to the market. Ford doesn’t want to let their loyalists down, so they’ve set their sights high.
Ford’s Concept
Ford has an ambitious goal. They envision being market-ready for a fully automated self-driving car as soon as 2021. Rather than exploring different states of vehicular automation, Ford wants to go directly to the top. Their concept is bold – a car with no steering wheel and no gas pedal. Ford hopes to first debut this ambitious vehicle with ride hailing apps (like Uber and Lyft) for on-road testing. If their fully automated vehicle is a success, it’s safe to assume it will become a market-ready consumer product after the testing phase is successfully completed.
GM is putting their money where their mouths are. They’ve recently acquired Cruise Automation, a startup centered around self-driving vehicles. This investment set GM back a hefty $581 million. When coupled with GM’s $500 million investment in Lyft (an acquisition of 9% of the entire company), it’s clear that their interest resides somewhere in autonomous vehicles for ride hailing apps. This move confused many, because GM also owns GM Cruise, it’s own autonomous vehicle subsidiary.
GM’s Concept
GM has remained remarkably quiet about their self-driving car concept for their main brand. The world knows they’re up to something, but they aren’t quick to say exactly what they’re doing. It’s logical to assume they’re exploring ride apps or courier services in small areas, but they’ve yet to fully announce a plan. There are rumors that GM may debut a new self-driving car any moment now, although those rumors remain unconfirmed.
GM Cruise, on the other hand, is a much bigger deal. Cruise is a manufacturing plant for vehicles with the typical GM body shapes and styles that are designed and developed for self-driving ventures outside of their Lyft partnership. If GM continues to hold onto its 9% stake in Lyft, they may become an unstoppable force in ride hailing faster than anyone expects.
BMW has been working closely with tech leaders Mobileye and Intel to create a revolutionary self-driving car framework. The young partnership recently announced they’ve made great strides in developing consumer-ready self-driving vehicles. BMW has made a name for themselves as a luxury status symbol, and it’s safe to assume their self-driving variant will mimic the same aura of sophistication as the rest of their offerings.
BMW’s Concept
BMW announced that they intend to have a final version of their self-driving models in production by 2021. Though they’ve not made any solid promises regarding release dates, they also anticipate that they will have fully autonomous vehicles in production shortly afterwards. BMW is playing it safe – they’ve made mention of the fact that they’re waiting to see what happens with regulations, laws, and infrastructure surrounding the production and sale of fully automated vehicles before they set anything in stone.
Volkswagen has a complicated history with self-driving cars. The company has attempted to invest in self-driving technology on numerous occasions, but nearly all of the deals have fallen through. While they’ve consistently expressed interest in dabbling with the idea, there always seems to be some kind of a barrier that prevents them from fully committing. A deal with self-driving startup company Aurora ultimately came to a halt and led Volkswagen into a different alliance.
Volkswagen’s Concept
Volkswagen isn’t going the proprietary route with their self-driving concepts. Instead, they’re gravitating towards Argo, Ford’s self-driving subsidiary. Their proposed $1.7 billion investment shows just how serious they are. Rather than expecting Volkswagen to come up with something new and revolutionary, expect them to become a joint part of Ford’s success in the self-driving arena. Volkswagen’s shooting to have a self-driving car in production by 2025.
Volvo and Uber have been working together for a number of years. The two have strived to create self-driving vehicles together, but have experienced many setbacks along the way. Throughout their many testing phases, the duo often paused to retool and improve their technology. Finally, they’ve created something they’re proud of.
Volvo’s Concept
Volvo has debuted a functioning alternate model of their already-existing XC90 SUV. This enhanced model has limited self-driving capabilities, complete with fail safes and backups, to assure the person in the driver’s seat can take control in unusual road conditions or react to sudden stimuli. This vehicle is specifically for use with Uber’s ride hailing service.
Volvo hasn’t announced an exact date regarding the consumer availability of this technology in the cars they manufacture, but they swear it’s coming. They’ve tentatively stated that the early 2020s looks promising for self-driving Volvo SUV’s that everyone can purchase.
If you haven’t heard of Waymo, don’t feel bad. Waymo is essentially Google – they’re both owned by Alphabet Inc. and have access to the same wealth of technology. Rather than manufacturing all of their own vehicles from the ground up, Waymo has made themselves available to a number of major vehicle brands. Waymo has collaborated with Fiat Chrysler in the past for different purposes. They’ve only recently debuted self-driving vehicles that they intend to use for their own autonomous ride hailing service, Waymo One.
Waymo’s Concept
Waymo is currently testing a self-driving crossover. They’ve partnered with Jaguar Land Rover to release the I-Pace, an electric self-driving car specifically for ride hailing. The I-Pace is currently testing in California. They are not yet an integral part of Waymo’s self-driving fleet, but they’re nearly prepared to become one. Waymo claims that their robotaxis will be operational by 2020, giving Uber’s self-driving fleet a run for its money.
Aptiv first made a name for themselves as Delphi Automotive. They rebranded and made some new and productive partnerships in their current space. Formerly a company focused on clean automotive manufacturing, Aptiv’s new approach is far more focused on technological innovations in the self-driving sector.
Volvo has Uber, and Aptiv has Lyft. Competition is high with ride hailing apps to create self-driving fleets, and Aptiv is throwing their hat into the ring. The most unique thing about Aptiv is that they’re both an automobile company and a self-driving software company. Rather than having to collaborate between companies, Aptiv can create proprietary self-driving vehicles from the ground up. Their recent partnership with Lyft shows that they’re interested in making money by taking on the competition.
Aptiv’s Concept
Currently, Aptiv is opening research and development centers all around the globe. The company has recently expanded into Singapore and China, opening up new economic opportunities. While Aptiv is keeping their secrets to themselves, brief glimpses of test vehicles suggest that they are primarily four door sedans. They intend to test the vehicles for road readiness any moment now.
Daimler, manufacturer of Mercedes vehicles, and Bosch, consumer and industrial technology giant, have joined forces. Daimler’s years of experience producing high priced luxury vehicles couples perfectly with Bosch’s experience in technological innovation. The vehicles created through this partnership are likely to be released under the Mercedes name and be made available first as self-driving ride hailing vehicles.
Daimler-Bosch’s Concept
They’re aiming for the loftiest possible goal – they’d like to mow right over self-driving cars and skip straight to fully automated driverless vehicles. This is an extraordinarily ambitious move, even when considering the amount of expertise these companies have in their respective fields. Visual concepts show a sleek, futuristic silver sedan with a glass top, but there’s no word on whether or not these concepts are a finalized version of the design. Because the venture is so large, Daimler-Bosch aims to release these vehicles sometime in the 2020s.
Testing, on the other hand, has already commenced. Daimler-Bosch recently chose San Jose as the pilot city for an automated ride-hailing service. That’s right – residents of San Jose will be able to ride in an autonomous taxi in the near future.
The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance was formed in 1999. This partnership encompasses a significant number of automotive brands, including Infiniti. The alliance is using its combined power, funding, and resources to embark on a new venture – self-driving cars. Since the alliance owns many brands, they intend to release ten different variants of autonomous vehicles and distribute these concepts among their many child brands.
Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi’s Concept
The alliance’s recent partnership with Microsoft has afforded them with the technology necessary to actualize their self-driving car concepts. As ambitious as it may be, the company’s CEO reports that they intend to have many of their various self-driving concept cars out on the road as soon as 2020. They’ve also made a lofty commitment to have completely driverless cars cruising on urban roads by 2025.
Tesla has a mixed reputation for its vehicles and innovation. Elon Musk founded Tesla to be, in essence, the world’s most futuristic automobile company. There’s seemingly no form of technology that Tesla hasn’t tried to implement. They started with autopilot and have demonstrated numerous self-driving features over the years, and were only prevented by laws and regulations from releasing a vehicle they claimed to be fully autonomous.
Tesla’s Concept
Many people are confused by Tesla’s concepts. People who don’t know much about Tesla assume that the vehicle drives itself. That’s not the case. Its enhanced autopilot features make the vehicle semi-autonomous, but the presence of an alert driver is absolutely necessary. Tesla continues to work towards tested and safe updates for all of its vehicles, delivering software through the air to every Tesla in the world. Their concept is continuing to grow in small increments over time, and the future still holds promise for the self-driving capabilities of its automobiles. In fact, one recent concept includes a self-driving electric motorhome.
Although Volkswagen owns Audi, these parent and child brands have completely different plans and strategies when it comes to self-driving cars. Audi has an extensive history of experimentation with autonomous driving features. Some of their releases, such as the A8 sedan, utilize technology that isn’t even approved for use in the United States. In an attempt to break past barriers and deliver highly capable self-driving technology to the US market, Audi has fortified their game plan and developed something new.
Audi’s Concepts
Audi wants to do more than make self-driving cars. Autonomous Intelligent Driving, or AID, as the company calls it, is a new system of technology Audi is using to revolutionize self-driving cars. Audi has equipped sedans with their proprietary AID technology and intends to first debut self-driving vehicles for robotaxi purposes. Alexandre Haag, CTO of Audi, explains the company wants to take the application of that technology even further. Expect food delivery vehicles, large trucks, and even buses to be equipped with the technology over the course of the next decade.
Honda is widely regarded as a practical, dependable, and reliable automotive brand. Hondas are family cars, but that doesn’t mean they can’t be exciting. While Honda has been slower than some of its similarly sized competitors to dabble with self-driving technology, that doesn’t mean they’ve passed up the opportunity to become a part of the future.
Honda’s Concept
Honda is taking a gentle and modest approach to self-driving cars. They aren’t looking to beat their competitors – they’re more interested in sticking with the times and delivering what people want in a safe and responsible way. Honda will have some self-driving capabilities in place by 2020, claiming that automated freeway driving is on the top of their list of priorities. Honda anticipates they’ll be finished developing and testing their nearly autonomous vehicle concept around 2025.
Zenuity is a partnership between Volvo and Swedish auto supplier Autoliv. Volvo as a parent company has diversified as much as possible, partnering with numerous automotive suppliers across the globe to test self-driving technology in various applications. This partnership was formed as a testing platform for smart driving tech that isn’t available in the United States just yet. Zenuity has been somewhat quiet about the features they’re intending to debut with their future releases.
Zenuity’s Concept
Zenuity is utilizing proprietary self-driving technology called IntelliSafe. They ambitiously claim that they’re working towards a zero fatality goal, hinting that IntelliSafe may be one of the smartest vehicles in development. The body of the vehicle is a modified version of Volvo’s XC90 SUV, the same body they’re using for their Uber collaboration. The first 100 Zenuity partnership vehicles are slated to be sold in Sweden sometime in 2021.

Every tech giant wants to take a crack at self-driving car technology. It’s no surprise that Microsoft has ambitiously thrown their hat in the ring. Microsoft is using a combination of software, artificial intelligence, and robotics to create the perfect self-driving car technology. Their slow process suggests that they’ve continuously refined their approach for about half a decade. Microsoft utilizes high-definition mapping services and special lens technology to create new capabilities for self-driving tech.
Microsoft’s Concept
Microsoft doesn’t intend to manufacture vehicles themselves. Instead, they appear to be creating functional technology that can be licensed to automobile manufacturers. This is a lucrative move – if they forego exclusive deals, they can see a portion of the profits from the sale of many different automotive brands. They’ve already licensed technology to Volvo, and have signed on to work with Toyota for the development of driver assisting robotics.
Paccar may not be a household name, but what they do is still instrumental to every household. The automotive company manufactures heavy duty commercial trucks, the kind used for delivery and logistics. Their recent partnership with Nvidia may have the potential to revolutionize the way shipments get from Point A to Point B.
Paccar’s Concept
Paccar is working to create self-driving commercial trucks. Autonomous trucks are thought to be much safer – many long haul truckers experience fatigue on the road, and having artificial intelligence to serve as autopilot may help to reduce driver fatigue and, as a result, accidents. Toyota, Tesla, Bosch, and Baidu have partnered with Paccar and Nvidia to make their concept a reality.
China’s biggest internet company Baidu has focused on autonomous driving for a number of years. In Spring of 2014, the company’s CEO Robin Li announced “the Android of autonomous driving”, the company’s pet side project. Several partnerships with automobile manufacturers have provided Baidu with numerous testing opportunities. The Chinese government has given their efforts the green light.
Baidu’s Concept
Baidu’s concept utilizes improved Apollo technology, similar to the starting point many American self-driving car makers have utilized. Initially, Baidu worked with BMW, but they parted ways due to creative differences. Now, Baidu’s self-driving concept vehicles are manufactured by Chinese carmaker Chery Automobile Company. Baidu intends to have cars at near complete levels of automation on the road in Beijing by 2020.
Apple has been shockingly slow in the self-driving car race. Most other competing tech giants (such as Alphabet Inc.) already have self-driving vehicles that are nearly ready for the market. Their self-driving initiative, titled Project Titan, has seen a lot of highs and lows. The company has employed NASA engineers to refine the technology they’ve kept under lock and key for the last few years.
Apple’s Concept
Apple’s self-driving car utilizes a Volkswagen T6 transporter body with proprietary tech. These vehicles are currently being manufactured and demonstrated as employee transportation vehicles that shuttle staff between different Apple facilities. While Apple has filed patents, they’ve not yet announced whether or not they intend to make their technology available to consumers. We’re still waiting on the big day.
Hyundai typically manufactures safe, simple, and affordable vehicles. Not many people suspected that Hyundai would get into the self-driving game, but they’ve surprised the masses. Their slow burning partnership with Israeli company Autotalks is giving them a technology development platform. Their recent move to hire former GM autonomous driving tech leader moved Hyundai to open their Intelligent Safety Technology Center.
Hyundai’s Concept
Hyundai’s efforts are only beginning – there’s no telling exactly how they’re approaching self-driving cars. They’ve announced they intend to start testing early prototypes in 2021, with a soft goal of creating a road-ready self-driving car by 2025. If a prototype currently exists, it’s being kept secret from the general public. Hyundai are keeping things hush-hush for the time being.
Huawei has always been known for android phones. They’re one of the largest telecommunication companies in China. Since 2016, they’ve quietly worked on self-driving technology in the background of their other operations. Vodafone wanted a piece of the action, partnering with Huawei in 2017 to merge ideas and fortify concepts via a Porsche test vehicle.
Huawei, Vodafone, and Porsche’s Concept
This trifecta’s technology involves smartphone controls integrated with an automobile’s controls. The automobile in question is the Porsche Panamera, which has been successfully test driven and improved since 2018. The technology in development is called Mate 10 Pro, and so far, its artificial intelligence capabilities have proven to be impressive. The technology allows the vehicle to recognize and differentiate between other vehicles, pedestrians, and objects it confronts. The vehicle can respond appropriately to its environment via its recognition capabilities.
Yutong is a Chinese transportation manufacturing company, specializing in mass public transport vehicles like buses. In early 2012, Yutong announced their plans to research and develop self-driving technology that may revolutionize the way China’s infrastructure operates. Greyhound Australia quickly took interest in Yutong’s project.
Yutong’s Concept
Yutong’s T12 model coach bus comes equipped with their self-driving technology. The bus is equipped to run in both manual and automatic modes. Greyhound Australia took on the T12 for a 6-month trial in June 2018. No major company has adopted the technology yet, making it safe to assume that Yutong is working behind the scenes to perfect their technology.





NIO is another Chinese automotive manufacturing company with an eye on mass production. The company primarily produces crossovers and SUVs with eye on the future. The automotive manufacturer recently made a major achievement for any automotive company: becoming publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
NIO’s Concept
NIO’s EVE concept serves as the company’s vision for the future of the automotive industry. The concept serves as an adaptable living space and features powerful artificial intelligence technology. NIO plans to officially offer semi-autonomous electric vehicles in the United States some time during the 2020 model year.
NAVYA primarily produces shuttles designed to tackle public transportation needs, and now the manufacturer is striving to create an advanced form of autonomous travel. Today, their vehicles can be found operating in cities, airports, and college campuses. With more than 250 engineers, designers, and experts at the helm, NAVYA strives to raise safety standards in autonomous public vehicles.
NAVYA’s Concept
Dubbed the AUTONOM SHUTTLE, NAVYA’s autonomous vehicle features optimized navigation and safety systems. The self-driving shuttle lacks a steering wheel and pedals, nodding towards the hands-off design experts believe will be standard in future autonomous models. Advanced guidance and detection systems, including Lidar sensors, generate data processed by deep learning programs to create a safe, hands-free ride.
Self-Driving Cars and the Future
Nearly every major automobile manufacturer working with a tech company wants people to be prepared for self-driving cars to hit the market in a few short years. Some of the more ambitious companies have worked quietly behind the scenes, letting consumers know when they’re ready to debut something new.
Despite the general public’s enthusiastic reaction to the prospect of self-driving vehicles, many manufacturers are shopping their concepts to app-based ride hailing companies first. This means that the general public is more likely to have an opportunity to ride in a self-driving car than to actually own one.
While many of the kinks in the technology necessary to power a self-driving car are still being worked out, we’re undoubtedly approaching the era of the fully autonomous vehicle. Regulations and laws will need to be negotiated and laid in place before a fully self-driving vehicle is allowed to hit the road. Even so, there’s no doubt enhanced self-driving capabilities are paving the way for a high tech future.

Commuting these days isn’t what it used to be. Instead of trying to draw workers into Boston, some Massachusetts businesses are often trying to get their most coveted employees to leave the city — at least for the work day.
Creating solutions to the so-called “first mile/last mile problem” helps make that possible. It means providing a way for workers to both get to the train — the first mile — and then how to get them to work — the last mile.
This is true in many parts of the state, but especially in the fast-growing region west of Boston.Paul Matthews is the executive director of the 495/Metrowest Partnership, a coalition of 35 communities from Westford to Foxboro. For years, he and others have been trying to make the commuter rail work, not only for businesses in Boston, but also the other way around — for the growing industries along Route 495. But Matthews said to make the train truly viable, you must get people from train stations to their workplaces.
“This is New England,” Matthews said. “You can’t get off the train in January and walk 2.5 miles to your place of work. You need a way of stepping onto a shuttle and getting there.”That shuttle most often takes the form of a van seating up to 16 people. But providing those shuttles to the almost 200,000 people working in MetroWest but living elsewhere is requiring people to get creative.
Doug Halley is the transportation coordinator for the town of Acton and for the CrossTown Connect Transportation Management Association, an effort funded by seven Massachusetts towns trying to get commuters out of their cars. Halley said they provide door-to-door service for seniors and for those with physical disabilities, and do commuter shuttles for area businesses. The shuttles drive local residents to the commuter rail so they can work in Boston, and bring workers coming in from Cambridge and Boston to work at companies along Route 495.
Halley thinks the MBTA could do a lot more to promote what’s called “reverse commuting” by lowering, or even eliminating, outbound fares.“The trains are virtually empty,” Halley said. “Why even worry about charging those people coming out? Once they establish the ridership base, they can start increasing those fares, but initially they should be encouraging people to come out here. The businesses out here need them.“In some cases, the employees need the shuttles as well. Peter Lowitt, who manages economic development for the office park at Fort Devens in central Mass., said many of the 130 reverse commuters at Devens depend on the commuter rail and the shuttle.
“In many cases, but for the shuttle bus, those folks wouldn’t be employed,” Lowitt said. “I was speaking with a gal who commutes out from Cambridge and she said she wouldn’t have taken the job if the commuter rail wasn’t here.”
MBTA officials have acknowledged they haven’t done enough to promote reverse commuting, but are now talking about testing reduced fares for reverse commuters — though not on all rail lines, and not on the Fitchburg train that serves Devens.
The state is also pledging to give more support to the shuttle van programs as a way to solve the first mile/last mile problems. Earlier this month, the MassDOT announced it would give $1.5 million to organizations like CrossTown Connect that can come up with creative solutions.An example is the Maynard/Acton Commuter Shuttle, which connects people to the South Acton Train Station two and a half miles outside of town. It also transports workers coming in from Boston to their jobs in Maynard. Usage of the shuttle has grown in three years, from 100 rides per month up to 800.
The commuter shuttles that run in Maynard, Acton, Littleton and four other nearby towns are examples of the kinds of collaborative approaches that Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack says the state is looking to fund.
“The reason people aren’t trying other ways of commuting to work and driving by themselves is not lack of information. It’s actually lack of services,” Pollack said at a recent transportation conference.Some advocates think the state could be doing more to promote these first mile/last mile services, like shuttles. Once people learn the shuttles are there and start using them, they keep using them. And as ridership grows, it means more people are getting to and from work without using their cars.That fulfills what Pollack says is today’s transportation imperative: “To move more people in fewer vehicles.”

The Department of Industry’s Fleet Optimisation Strategy, ushered in by Senior Manager Fleet Services John Barlow, earned him a major gong at an industry awards night this month.
John Barlow has been named Fleet Manager of the year for his cost-cutting strategies.
Mr Barlow was named Fleet Manager of the Year at the ceremony in Melbourne on May 23.
As well as introducing telematics – a method that maps the location and monitors activity of vehicles – Mr Barlow has also brought hybrid electric vehicles into the fleet and  successfully piloted car share services in the town of Orange, where about 900 department staff are based.
Department of Industry Executive Director Corporate Operations, Katherine Tollner, said Mr Barlow’s strategy had slashed more than $1 million off the annual operating costs of pool vehicles and he and his team were leading the way for public sector organisations.
A potential life-saver
Mr Barlow says using vehicle telematics is a potential life saver for the staff who drive the department’s 1,260 passenger, light and heavy commercial vehicles.
“Driving was identified as the biggest risk that staff face in the workplace because of the long hours and long distances and they mostly travel alone,” he said.
The telematics system can automatically alert a 24-hour Australian-based call centre if a vehicle rolls, if it detects an accident, or if the driver activates the duress alarm.
Telematics data is also used to monitor, manage and optimise the fleet, Mr Barlow says.
“From a fleet manager’s point of view we can see how often a vehicle is used, and if it has low monthly kilometres we can decide to remove or relocate that vehicle.”
Since the telematics system has been introduced the department has been able to reduce the number of pool vehicles by 80 vehicles.
Installing the technology has also had a significant influence on the incident rate of a fleet, with at-fault claims down by around 90 per cent, he said.
“The number of at-fault claims has greatly reduced for the period that we’ve had it in.
“The driver is conscious that their driving is being monitored, so that makes a difference to how the vehicle is treated.”
The technology can be configured to record a events such as harsh acceleration, sudden braking or hard cornering – all manoeuvres which increase the risk of a collision.
 ‘The future is electric’
 The department has also invested in hybrid vehicles and charging stations, which have been installed at numerous regional and metropolitan locations around NSW.
“We’ve been the first NSW government department to take on some hybrid electric vehicles, they are the plug-in hybrid electric Mitsubishi Outlander. They operate on an electric charge, but they convert over to petrol once the electric charge runs out,” he told Government News.
“Once again from a regional perspective we’ve been able to show these sorts of vehicles work very well in a fleet.”
Mr Barlow says he’s keen to introduce fully electric vehicles into the Orange-based fleet and sees this as the way forward for government fleets.
“There’s definitely going to be a place for electric vehicles in governments in the future,” he said.
 GoGet car sharing to expand
Under Barlow’s leadership, the department has also entered into a partnership with GoGet car sharing services. Since last July there have been six GoGet cars that anyone can use.
“This means department staff now have alternative vehicle options and the Orange community and tourists benefit as they can also access the vehicles,” he said.
Mr Barlow said the department is in discussion with GoGet about putting the share vehicles into other regional NSW settings.
He said he felt honoured to win the award. “It was a great result for the team and myself and for the department as a whole, for me,” he told Government News. “These things can only be achieved through the support of senior management, without their support it would be very difficult to drive the fleet efficiencies that we have achieved.”

While discussions on the impact of the introduction of ridesharing in Metro Vancouver have largely revolved around how taxis and public transit will fair, one other mobility service that could see a dent to its use is car share.
Specifically, point-to-point, free-floating services operated by Car2Go/Share Now and Evo Car Share — the dominant form of carsharing in the region, with vehicles picked up and left anywhere within the company’s operating area — are expected to be impacted most.
With greater freedom of use for this type of carshare, there is a significant overlap with the type of mobility provided by rideshare services.
A 2018 report by Vancity on the impact of carshare in Vancouver deems the city to be “North America’s carsharing capital.”
According to the report, in late 2017, there were approximately 3,000 carshare vehicles in the region — more than the 2,080 vehicles in Montreal, 1,900 vehicles in Seattle, 1,650 vehicles in Toronto, 1,500 vehicles in San Francisco, and 1,060 vehicles in Portland. All of these cities have rideshare services, dominated by Uber and Lyft.
On a vehicle-per-capita basis, Vancouver also beats carshare stronghold cities of Milan and Berlin; Vancouver has 4.22 carshare vehicles per 1,000 people.
“Other suggested factors behind Metro Vancouver’s car- sharing success include a limited supply of taxis, an absence of ridesharing services such as Uber and Lyft, short supplies of affordable housing and parking, more environmentally conscious residents, a young urban population more likely to prioritize big city living over car ownership, and a large immigrant population (many unaccustomed to North America’s car culture),” states the report.
A Fall 2017 survey of frequent carshare users found that 53% of those between the ages of 19 and 30 are using carshare due to the absence of Uber and Lyft, and 18% for the older age range of 51 to 60. Across respondents in both Vancouver and the wider Metro Vancouver region, latent, unmet demand for ridesharing was 43%.
The latest data, as of Spring 2019, shows there are now over 3,500 carshare vehicles in the region, with free-floating carshare services — mainly Car2Go and Evo — accounting for 80% of the entire carshare fleet in Vancouver.
Kendell Kelton with Share Now, the parent company of Car2Go, confirmed for Daily Hive that Vancouver is Car2Go’s largest market in North America. As of August 2019, they have about 223,000 members in Metro Vancouver sharing 1,200 vehicles.
Marc-David Seidel, a professor at the UBC Sauder School of Business, says the free-floating carshare companies likely saw “an initial bump” when they first launched in the region as a result of the absence of rideshare.
At the same time, he believes the entrenched nature of carshare use in Vancouver will allow companies to better overcome a new type of competition to the local market.
“Carsharing companies now have an established base of people used to using them, so the entry now of rideshare is probably not going to have as much of a negative impact on them as it would have prior to them being created,” Seidel told Daily Hive in an interview.
“They have a critical mass in essence, and people have established patterns and are used to the idea. There are certain times when that will be more convenient for certain models and less expensive than ridehailing.”
Taxis would see the greatest impact from rideshare, followed by free-floating carshare services. He does not anticipate any negative impact to fixed-point, two-way station rideshare services like Modo and Zipcar, which require users to pick up and return a vehicle at a designated station.
Another factor that could determine how free-floating carshare services will be able to compete is the cost of using rideshare. While the Passenger Transportation Board (PTB) has determined that the minimum base fare for rideshare will be the taxi flag rate, there is still some ambiguity over the distance-travelled per kilometre cost beyond the base fare.
“Depending on how low that price goes, it could have more of an impact on the carshare market,” added Seidel.
As well, the operating areas of Car2Go and Evo are relatively limited.
Car2Go’s free-floating home area covers most of the cities of Vancouver and North Vancouver, plus satellite parking hubs at UBC, Vancouver International Airport, and BCIT.
With Evo, its home areas are limited to the cities of Vancouver, North Vancouver, and New Westminster, and designated areas at UBC, SFU Burnaby Mountain, Capilano University, BCIT, and Vancouver International Airport.
Car2Go and Evo users must start and end their trip within the home area or a satellite/designated parking hub. These locations — high-density areas, and where there is generally less car ownership — are strategic for the companies for both demand and maintenance reasons.
While the PTB has granted rideshare companies with the ability to operate within an expansive boundary that encompasses all of Metro Vancouver, the Fraser Valley, Squamish, and Whistler, nothing restricts companies like Uber and Lyft from only selecting key operating areas within the region to focus on, especially in the face of the possible difficulty in finding enough drivers with a Class 4 commercial license.
Both Uber and Lyft announced their intentions this month to launch services in Metro Vancouver before the end of the year, but the yet-to-be-determined availability of their services would likely be a factor for free-floating carshare’s ability to compete.
More recently, soaring gas prices have also driven more people in the region towards carshare services, with fuel, parking, and insurance all included.
In May 2018, during the region’s record-setting gas prices, Car2Go reported that its use was up by 23% year-over-year, and there had been a 10% increase in its number of local members. The company also saw historic highs in the utilization of its fleet, topping at over 13% per week.
At the moment, both free-floating carshare giants operating in Metro Vancouver say they are unfazed by the new competition brought by the introduction of rideshare, and welcome the improved mobility services like Uber and Lyft will enable.
“Share Now continues to support a multimodal lifestyle. The rapid growth and popularity of the mobility sector means that, more than ever before, people are embracing shared transportation options as a way to move around the cities in which they live, work and/or play,” said Kelton.
“Ultimately, this means that the need for personal vehicle ownership is declining, and that itself is a very good thing and something we support.”
Tai Silvey, vice-president of Evo, had a similar take on the arrival of rideshare: “Evo is all for more mobility choices for British Columbians. Our research shows that Evo members use a variety of ways to get around — car share, transit, biking, taxi. Ridehailing will just add one more option. Each transportation mode has its purpose… We believe there’s room for everyone.”
She says free-floating carshare services like Evo enable convenient trips with multiple stops and the transport of large cargo such as bikes and skis, as well as longer trips.
To a certain extent, carsharing also has a symbiotic relationship with public transit; Vancity’s study determined “a correlation between good public transit systems and carsharing.”
“Transit options and availability must be present for car-sharing to be a realistic alternative to private vehicle ownership; people cannot — or will not — carshare for every trip they choose to make. Vancouver has a reasonable, and expanding, transit system that works well in combination with car-sharing,” reads the study.
The City of Vancouver has also been encouraging carsharing as an effective measure to reduce private vehicle use, making moves that further entrench carshare services into the mobility fabric of the city.
In July, it relaxed a number of parking rules for carshare vehicles, allowing carshare vehicles to end their trips in metered curbside parking spaces, for instance, to improve their accessibility and usability in retail areas. Other changes include new incentives that encourage carshare companies to transition to zero-emission vehicle models over the coming years.
As well, the city has been working with developers to have them build carsharing spaces into their new building projects. In exchange, the city reduces the number of costly parking stalls required for a development.
According to the city’s research, free-floating carshare services can reduce transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions by up to 15%, while fixed-point carshare reductions reach a ceiling reduction of 54%

Engineers attending this year’s 5G Days at Nokia’s Paris-Saclay campus were likely to stumble into an unusual gofer rambling the streets of the 4,000 employees’ facility: a small ADR (autonomous delivery robot) with parcel lockers, delivering goods without human intervention or guidance.
The robot was part of a one-shot demonstration for Nokia customers and partners, but it could soon become the default option for the delivery of small parcels across the campus.
“Campus facility manager Sodexo, together with Nokia have decided not to deliver parcel below 5 kilos to the personnel on the campus anymore. This means that any person working in this huge campus has to go to the central warehouse to get the parcel they ordered, which is not very convenient. ADRs could give great help in improving the service,” EIT Digital’s Jean-Philippe Bellaiche says.
Bellaiche is the venture creation lead of Last Mile Autonomous Delivery (LMAD), an EIT Digital-supported AAA* innovation activity which is creating a software platform to pilot multiple types of robots for various kind of deliveries.
“We will operate an extensive pilot on the campus during the first quarter of next year. Our goal is to operate the delivery of all small parcels across the campus but, to achieve this, we will have to overcome some serious roadblocks about technology, authorizations, and customer acceptance,” he adds.
The Nokia campus is just one in a number of use cases that will be implemented by the LMAD consortium of partners (which includes Bestmile, GIM Robotics, BookIT, PICOM, Forum Virium Helsinki and Futurice) in the next two years.
The first tests will be held in private, controlled, areas similar to the Paris-Saclay facility, in which the ADRs can move smoothly, without meeting too many constraints; later, they will be extended to more challenging environments, such as city centres.
Possible use case scenarios include postal delivery using smart lockers, delivery of groceries ordered online by means of small-sized autonomous vehicles, small robots going from supply truck to customers’ doors.
Parcel-delivering ADRs can already be seen in Asia and the US; one of LMAD’s goals is to incentivize their usage in Europe as well.
By 2030, according to a 2016 McKinsey report, drones and autonomous robots with parcel lockers will dominate the segment, delivering close to 80% of all items.
Cutting costs, reducing traffic congestion, satisfying the growing demand due to the increase in e-commerce sales are the main drivers of change for companies and customers.
Drones will be used mostly in rural areas, to cover long distances in low population density areas, whereas small robots running on pavements or bicycle lanes are bound to become the best autonomous solutions for urban environments. The last-mile delivery transformation will take some time, but the path is set.
“The transition from traditional delivery to the new methods won’t be finalized in a day. It’s a long-run market, due to technical constraints and the shift from manual driving to autonomous driving,” Bellaiche says.
To support and implement these new retail practices, a startup will be created by the end of the year to commercialize the LMAD’s software platform. The company’s business model will be based on charging the logistics operator (the postal service, restaurants, etc.) a fee for the platform, plus a fee for the delivery, covering this way both fixed and variable costs.

  *AAA activities are pre-seed activities creating startups with high impact and revenue potential.

Your mother probably told you never to get in a car with a stranger. The multibillion-dollar global ride-hailing industry depends on your ignoring her. If they want to earn that trust, though, companies need to rethink the trade-off they’ve long made between safety and cost.
Around the world, passengers are now hailing more than 10.5-billion rides a year. Not surprisingly, some have ended in tragedy. Uber came under fire in India after a 26-year-old woman was raped by one of its drivers in 2014, and local rival Ola has faced a similar backlash. In the US, Lyft has been sued by multiple women who say drivers sexually assaulted them.
In 2018, within the span of three months, two female passengers were murdered by drivers of China’s ride-sharing company, Didi Chuxing. Didi’s Hitch car-pooling service was once marketed almost as a cross between Uber and Tinder: a taxi service that let drivers and passengers rate each other by appearance. Didi halted Hitch in August 2018 after an outpouring of anger from state media, regulators and China’s version of the #DeleteUber movement.
Last week, Didi announced plans to restart Hitch on a trial basis in seven Chinese cities by the end of November. The decision follows a “comprehensive safety review and product revamp”, as well as the introduction of a new women’s safety programme that includes better “risk analysis” and an updated in-app security assistant. Didi plans to spend 2-billion yuan (R4.2bn) on safety measures in 2019, including more frequent use of facial-recognition technology — to ensure drivers are who they say they are — and a deeper review of abnormal driving patterns, as well as more regular safety tests for drivers.






But the key to the Hitch relaunch are new restrictions on the programme. The service will be limited to trips under 50km and women can only ride between 5am and 8pm. By contrast, men can keep riding until 11pm.
While the company’s intentions are good, this is no solution. A sophisticated analysis of high-risk scenarios won’t help you if you’re stuck in the back seat within an inch of your life. And to assume that a woman will only be raped and murdered between 8pm and 5am more than 50km from her pick-up point seems a bit naïve.
What the ride-hailing industry in China and elsewhere really needs to do is re-examine who’s allowed to drive in the first place. It’s hard to say whether the measures Didi is now implementing would have screened out Zhong Yuan, the 28-year-old Hitch driver who was executed in August for murdering his 20-year-old passenger. After passing background checks and providing documentation, you can still become a Didi driver in 10 days or less.
Instead, companies should be raising the barriers to entry so they’re hiring fewer, better drivers. And if they won’t, governments should step in. In Malaysia, regulators now require aspiring drivers to pass written exams and health checks, and to register for specific permits. About a third of applicants have failed the exam thus far, transport minister Anthony Loke said in October, and more than 20% of Grab drivers have reportedly quit to avoid complying with the stricter regulations.
Singapore imposed new rules earlier in 2019 to bring ride-hailing companies closer in line with taxi operators. The regulations were proposed less than a week after my Bloomberg News colleague Yoolim Lee wrote about a Grab accident that left her with a broken neck and at risk of stroke. She estimated that, around the time of the incident, nearly half of private-hire drivers in the city didn’t have the proper licence and shouldn’t have been driving. While fewer drivers doesn’t necessarily mean safer drivers, a steeper commitment at least means they have a lot more at stake to protect their livelihoods.
The genius of the gig economy is the ability to make money from underutilised, ubiquitous skills. Yet the model may have been taken too far. Just because you can make an omelette doesn’t mean you should run a diner. So why should you drive professionally just because you have a licence?
Shrinking the supply of drivers will obviously make rides more expensive. But it’s worth judging the prospect of higher prices against the long cycle of the internet economy. The internet has made everything from academic research to air travel cheaper and easier to access. At the same time, quality goods and services can’t be free forever: we’ve seen this in the news business, where websites that once offered unfettered access to their journalism (including Bloomberg) have implemented paywalls. If fewer drivers means safer rides, that’s a price most people should be willing to pay.

The parking technology company FlashParking wants to reimagine the way parking lots are managed. But alongside their efforts to introduce smart technology to individual operators, the company is taking a decidedly different approach to decreasing traffic congestion in cities.

Operating under the belief that most technology solutions to urban challenges are unnecessarily complicated, the team at FlashParking is working toward solutions that redirect resources away from constantly updating technology. Instead, FlashParking is pushing a system that embraces a “future-ready” approach — in which hardware and software infrastructures are built to transform over time for long-term durability.

“The parking industry is one of the last sectors to accept the direction of technology, consumer expectations, and business standards,” says FlashParking CEO and Co-Founder Juan Rodriguez.
Rather than putting complete reliance on automation, AI, or any of the other machine learning technologies that are trendy in the auto industry right now, FlashParking is taking a streamlined approach to parking management. The company offers an integrated suite of hardware and subscription solutions for parking operators and asset owners to manage their gated, parking lot, and valet operations.
One of FlashParking’s chief missions is to solve a problem that Rodriguez refers to as the “mobility challenge.”
The mobility challenge is the threat presented by increasing urbanization, increasing vehicle miles traveled, and congestion with deteriorating infrastructure. By 2030, 60% of the world’s population will live in cities (up from 50% today), and congestion can cost as much as 2% to 4% of national GDP by measures such as lost time, wasted fuel, and the increased cost of doing business.
Solving the mobility challenge won’t stop at transit, but FlashParking believes it does require changes to be made to existing transit infrastructure. The company is moving away from isolated parking assets as it promotes connected mobility hubs.
FlashParking’s infrastructure focuses on perfecting the parking experience at the site level. But while competitors are retrofitting solutions, FlashParking is taking a cloud-first approach. FlashParking’s operating partners are still managing, brokering, and monetizing traditional parking garages, but the company is working to add a technology layer to enable new transactions via a secure, real-time engine, with frictionless movement of all vehicle types. At scale, and with the right demand-side data via consumer app integrations, FlashParking’s connected mobility hubs could represent a practical solution to congestion in some of the country’s largest cities.
“If you think about the future of our mobility ecosystem, FlashParking will be at the center, as the infrastructure layer that supports mobility hubs and all the partners connected to them with a secure payment system,” Rodriguez says.
FlashParking sells through a direct model, without distributors. While that’s the preferred standard in many industries, Rodriguez says the parking industry is still resisting.
“The same goes for the cloud, where we trust so much of our day to day activities; but there are still late adopters that are not 100% comfortable with operating parking access and revenue control in the cloud,” he says. “We have had incredible success in leading the industry towards its inevitable future, and are growing over 100% year over year—but the resistance to adapting with technology is why we aren’t doing 1000%.”
Although FlashParking supports a number of verticals, Rodriguez says urban centers with downtown areas that support mobility services like TNCs and scooters are the places where the difference between an isolated parking garage and a connected mobility hub will have the greatest impact.
“The growth we’re seeing across the board right now is encouraging because, while each vertical has unique motivations, there is actually a lot of overlap in their ultimate goals—meaning that there are a ton of mutually-beneficial efficiencies that we can establish,” he says.
As FlashParking focuses on future growth, the company is looking to double down on the number of integrations and its adjacent partnerships. It’s also working to hold off companies like ParkJockey, which are evolving into larger, well-financed groups, by scaling up quickly.
“Throughout the process of finding a place to park, reserving a space, gaining access to a garage, navigating, enjoying additional services, and paying—there are so many touch points where significant value can be added by partners,” Rodriguez says. “And that is really what continues to drive people to those garages—a drastically better, frictionless parking experience.”

The new-fangled world of micro-mobility is one that seems to have the transportation industry buzzing, with record user growth rates and even more dizzying company valuations. It’s not without good reason either. Micro-mobility, which could easily be just described as small personal transportation devices, like bicycles, scooters and everything in-between, has been greatly enabled by electrification and app-based sharing, which has unleashed all sorts of new innovative business models.
The premise makes complete sense. Why take a car in a dense urban setting when a small device that consumes far less energy and space can be used instead? The low vehicle cost and low operating cost means trips are cheap, effectively a great enabler for those with lower incomes. It also addresses the problem of “first and last mile” — getting from major transit routes to home or work and vice versa. These enablements, plus the convenience of having a mobility solution close by wherever you are, especially with dockless devices, makes for a very enticing mobility solution.
Fun to ride
Another aspect about micro-mobility, and scooters in particular, is that they’re fun to ride. In our annual Mobility Study, published last year, we found that it’s easily the No. 1 reason to ride a scooter. Fully 25% of respondents who ride scooters cited this factor, and it is likely a key attribute propelling their record growth.
It’s this idea of fun — plus the efficiency, convenience and urban suitability — that proponents rightly key in on and promote.

However, micro-mobility solutions as a whole have a bunch of problems. They are open to vandalization and abuse, can’t be used in poor weather (especially unsuitable for cold winters), and have an unsavory habit of bringing out anti-social rider behaviour. As well, electric bikes and scooters need to be charged, which is especially problematic for dockless business models where scooters can be left almost anywhere.
But dangerous, too
Scooters have another unique and far reaching problem — safety. Technically, it would be defined as high levels of instability due to a combination of short wheelbase, small wheels and high centre of gravity. In short, most scooters are dangerous because they’re hard to control and easily tripped up. Take a quick look at the design and riding position of a scooter and it’s easy to figure out: riders stand with their feet just behind a tiny front wheel.
Add to that a top speed of up to 25 kilometres per hour and almost no helmet usage, and it’s no wonder that injuries from scooter accidents often result in severe trauma, particularly head injuries. Two studies, one done by Austin Public Health and supported by the U.S. Center for Disease Control in Austin, Tex., and the second by the New Zealand Medical Journal, showed that injuries sustained are often similar to severe car accidents. In fact, the CDC study showed the rate of injuries in the U.S. per given distance covered were around 27 times higher than for cycling — in a country known for very poor cycling infrastructure and much higher cycling injury rates than in Europe.


E-scooter design needs to be safer: bigger wheels, better brakes, suspension, a longer wheelbase, wider deck
James Carter, Principal Consultant, Vision Mobility

For any safety advocate and concerned citizen this is a disastrous situation, and one that micro-mobility companies gloss over. They point to the fact that there are many more car accident injuries and deaths; of course, conveniently ignoring that car usage is many, many multiples higher than scooter usage. It’s like saying that base jumping and free climbing El Capitan is safer than driving your car because there are fewer total injuries and deaths from people doing these activities.
Public anger
Micro-mobility, especially scooters, has also proven to have a unique ability to create public anger and consternation. There are plenty of videos of pedestrians getting hit by inattentive scooter riders, scooters being left strewn on foot paths and blocking entranceways and generally giving the city an untidy look. Even if these things don’t result in injuries, they sure arouse strong feelings among citizens; for elected officials, supporting such activities could be the kiss of death. Already, more than a few cities have banned scooters and more again are taking plenty of time to think about appropriate introduction and rollout.
On a visit to Washington, D.C., earlier this year, I took the opportunity of the well-stocked micro-mobility scene to take a couple different options for a spin. The first was a Bird scooter. It was, by any practical measure, truly appalling to ride. Terrible ride quality made my face shudder over the smallest bump, pavement joints became major obstacles and braking was almost non-existent. I had to keep my eyes peeled for unexpected obstacles like tree roots or broken pavement, as well as unaware pedestrians. The riding position also felt quite unstable — I knew that if I got in to trouble, I was down and hurtin’ bad.
Scooter vs. bike
Having said all that, cruising Washington’s National Mall on a warm spring day on a scooter was a delight. It was fun, as our survey indicated, almost like being transported upright to the next sightseeing adventure.

An Uber Jump electric bike

Jumping onto a Jump e-bike straight after was a revelation. Greatly enhanced power, stability and braking made it much safer to ride, even if the brake’s effectiveness were no match for the hydraulic discs on my mountain bike. I could safely jump curbs and unexpected 4-inch high obstacles were never a problem. The pedal activated e-motor rocketed me ahead from a standstill and it didn’t take long to hit the maximum speed of more than 30 kilometres per hour. Strangely, I put the e-bike away earlier. Somehow it wasn’t as fun or cool. Was it the styling or riding position? And why were scooter riders out numbering cyclists by about five to one in that area?
Indeed, why are scooters so popular, yet so hated? With twice the growth rate of ride hailing and seemingly five times the opposition, what is next for e-scooters and micro-mobility?
A harmonious service?
Without doubt, there’s more than sufficient demand, and the promise is admirable. Thus, the question that really interests me is how can micro-mobility grow beyond its problematic introduction to truly become a harmonious service to a city and its residents?
To start, both scooters and bikes need to be dropped off in specific areas that represent a tidy solution to the city landscape. This means that they aren’t in the way and not a danger to pedestrians and those with disabilities.

Rider training needs also to be substantially improved, including wearing a helmet. The CDC survey found that a high propensity of accidents involved riders with very limited experience; in cases where riders were hospitalized, more than half the time it was to treat head injuries.
Most importantly, e-scooter design needs to be safer. The current crop of e-scooters are not more than toys, and frankly it’s not a hard fix: bigger wheels, better brakes, suspension, a longer wheelbase, wider deck and a seat would fix just about all the major problems. If that sounds like a mini moped, you’re probably correct. But who wants to ride a moped? Audrey Hepburn’s “Roman Holiday” was a long, long time ago.
Yawning gulf
It’s as though safety and cool need to come together in a harmonious package, and the recent scooter updates by Bird and Lime are laughable. Today, there’s a yawning gulf between these two ideals, and it continues to create all sorts of consternation, anger and, sadly, frequent serious injuries and deaths. The scooter company that figures out what truly is safe and cool, will be an out-of-the-park success. It’s only then that a safe, efficient, last-mile solution can be realized, something that micro-mobility has promised, but not yet delivered.

Commuting these days isn’t what it used to be. Instead of trying to draw workers into Boston, some Massachusetts businesses are often trying to get their most coveted employees to leave the city — at least for the work day.
Creating solutions to the so-called “first mile/last mile problem” helps make that possible. It means providing a way for workers to both get to the train — the first mile — and then how to get them to work — the last mile.
This is true in many parts of the state, but especially in the fast-growing region west of Boston.
Paul Matthews is the executive director of the 495/Metrowest Partnership, a coalition of 35 communities from Westford to Foxboro. For years, he and others have been trying to make the commuter rail work, not only for businesses in Boston, but also the other way around — for the growing industries along Route 495. But Matthews said to make the train truly viable, you must get people from train stations to their workplaces.
“This is New England,” Matthews said. “You can’t get off the train in January and walk 2.5 miles to your place of work. You need a way of stepping onto a shuttle and getting there.”
That shuttle most often takes the form of a van seating up to 16 people. But providing those shuttles to the almost 200,000 people working in MetroWest but living elsewhere is requiring people to get creative.
Doug Halley is the transportation coordinator for the town of Acton and for the CrossTown Connect Transportation Management Association, an effort funded by seven Massachusetts towns trying to get commuters out of their cars. Halley said they provide door-to-door service for seniors and for those with physical disabilities, and do commuter shuttles for area businesses. The shuttles drive local residents to the commuter rail so they can work in Boston, and bring workers coming in from Cambridge and Boston to work at companies along Route 495.
Halley thinks the MBTA could do a lot more to promote what’s called “reverse commuting” by lowering, or even eliminating, outbound fares.
“The trains are virtually empty,” Halley said. “Why even worry about charging those people coming out? Once they establish the ridership base, they can start increasing those fares, but initially they should be encouraging people to come out here. The businesses out here need them.“
In some cases, the employees need the shuttles as well. Peter Lowitt, who manages economic development for the office park at Fort Devens in central Mass., said many of the 130 reverse commuters at Devens depend on the commuter rail and the shuttle.
“In many cases, but for the shuttle bus, those folks wouldn’t be employed,” Lowitt said. “I was speaking with a gal who commutes out from Cambridge and she said she wouldn’t have taken the job if the commuter rail wasn’t here.”
MBTA officials have acknowledged they haven’t done enough to promote reverse commuting, but are now talking about testing reduced fares for reverse commuters — though not on all rail lines, and not on the Fitchburg train that serves Devens.
The state is also pledging to give more support to the shuttle van programs as a way to solve the first mile/last mile problems. Earlier this month, the MassDOT announced it would give $1.5 million to organizations like CrossTown Connect that can come up with creative solutions.
An example is the Maynard/Acton Commuter Shuttle, which connects people to the South Acton Train Station two and a half miles outside of town. It also transports workers coming in from Boston to their jobs in Maynard. Usage of the shuttle has grown in three years, from 100 rides per month up to 800.
The commuter shuttles that run in Maynard, Acton, Littleton and four other nearby towns are examples of the kinds of collaborative approaches that Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack says the state is looking to fund.
“The reason people aren’t trying other ways of commuting to work and driving by themselves is not lack of information. It’s actually lack of services,” Pollack said at a recent transportation conference.
Some advocates think the state could be doing more to promote these first mile/last mile services, like shuttles. Once people learn the shuttles are there and start using them, they keep using them. And as ridership grows, it means more people are getting to and from work without using their cars.
That fulfills what Pollack says is today’s transportation imperative: “To move more people in fewer vehicles.”

If you’ve ridden light rail in the Rainier Valley in the past few months you’ve no doubt seen them: black vans with a blue Seattle skyline painted on the sides.
Called Via to Transit, the vans look like they could be an Uber spinoff. In fact, passengers dial up the rides through an app similar to any ride hailing service. But as the King County Metro Transit logo emblazoned on the door indicates, the vans are part of a county-run experiment with on-demand “microtransit.”






Launched in April, the service connects transit riders with light rail and bus lines. Southeast Seattle has little east-west bus service, which makes it difficult for people to reach the north-south-running light rail line by bus.
“We’re making it easier for people to access light rail and our buses,” said Casey Gifford, Metro’s Via project manager. “It is also about broadening access to [ride hailing] for populations that haven’t generally been able to access them.”
Via is a private company contracted by Metro to provide the vans, drivers and technology. The $3.2 million, year-long operation is funded by $2.7 million from Seattle’s transportation benefits district levy, a $350,000 Federal Transit Administration grant and $100,000 each from Metro and Sound Transit. Four months into the pilot project, Metro has collected enough data to get a sense of whether the subsidized rideshare is working.
It’s far too early for the agency to declare victory, but so far, the service has exceeded Metro’s daily ridership goals and served up more than 70,000 total rides.
Via users order a ride through the app or by calling a service center at 206-258-7739. Users connect with a driver and are usually directed to walk a few blocks for pickup. All rides on Via have the potential to be shared rides, similar to UberPool or Lyft Shared, so the app tries to route the driver on the straightest line between pickups and final destinations.
Rides cost the same as taking the bus: $2.75 for adults, $1.50 for low-income riders with ORCA Lift cards. Rides are paid for with ORCA cards or the Transit GO Ticket app. Users can also preload ORCA cards in advance with cash — an effort to increase access for people without smartphones and banks — but the drivers cannot accept cash. Via has 18 vans in its fleet, some of which are wheelchair accessible.
The service is available in the Rainier Valley in neighborhoods surrounding the Mount Baker, Columbia City, Othello and Rainier Beach rail stations, as well is in Tukwila near the Tukwila International Boulevard station. To keep the trips short, rides must take place within a relatively small service area; the Columbia City service area for example is about 2 square miles stretching between Beacon Hill, Lake Washington and Dakota and Orcas streets.
So, are people taking advantage of an opportunity for low-cost ride hailing? More than expected, said Metro’s Gifford. According to her, the goal was to average 525 rides per day. Instead Via averages 770 rides a day, with 1,000 rides on the busiest days.
That puts Via’s ridership on par with bus routes designed to ensure an area has at least some transit coverage. The 121 route from Burien to downtown Seattle averages 900 rides a day, in the ballpark with Via’s initial ridership.
About 30 percent of Via’s ridership so far has been reduced-fare rides. Gifford could not provide data about the number of rides that have been carpool rides versus solo rides. Just over 200 wheelchair users have taken Via rides.
According to Metro, Via’s cost per ride to the operator is about $10. Compared to Metro’s systemwide cost per boarding of $4.92, that’s expensive. But high ridership bus routes have a lower cost per boarding than low ridership routes, meaning Via’s costs are not wildly out of line with costs associated with low-rider routes.
Metro’s Gifford explained that unlike Uber and Lyft drivers who are paid per ride, Via drivers are paid an hourly wage. The agency’s contract with Via stipulates a base wage of $15 an hour, with a higher rate paid at rush hour and for driving wheelchair users. Via driver wages are lower than the union Metro driver scale.
“Is this cost reasonable mostly because we’re relying on lower-wage labor?” asked Katie Wilson, general secretary of the Transit Riders Union, an advocacy group. “So it’s a question of how far do we want to go down that road.”
Providing people better access to transit is the goal of the program and one end of the trip must be to or from the light rail station within the service area. People could theoretically use Via to get to the grocery store, a friend’s house or to work, if it was close to the light rail station, however.
That doesn’t appear to be happening much. Gifford said ORCA card data shows more than 90 percent of Via riders transfer to and from light rail. Metro is just beginning to conduct rider surveys to find out whether Via is creating new transit riders, whether people are replacing car trips to the light rail station or simply giving up and replacing slower bus rides.
Hester Serebrin, policy director with the advocacy nonprofit Transportation Choices Coalition, said she’s excited about the data Metro might glean from Via showing where and when people need better transportation, but hopes that contracted, on-demand van service isn’t a permanent fixture.
“We see this as an interim solution,” Serebrin said. “But fixed-route, publicly owned transit is the ultimate solution. We want to be able to expand King County Metro service and make sure their buses are reliable, fast, affordable.”
Ben Fried, communications director at the New York-based transportation research nonprofit TransitCenter, similarly thinks a service like Via can’t be a replacement for good bus service, but can potentially be a substitute for something like Access paratransit — Metro’s on-demand service for people with mental or physical disabilities who can’t otherwise ride transit.
“A good way of thinking about microtransit is it can be a slightly more efficient paratransit-type service,” he explained. “But it can’t be a substitute for fixed-route service. It just doesn’t scale up the way a bus does.”
Metro operates two similar programs: one to connect people on the Eastside to the Eastgate Park and Ride and another to connect West Seattleites from the California-Alaska Junction to the Alki water taxi. Via also operates in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere. Some places, such as Pinellas County, Florida, offer residents subsidized Uber and Lyft rides to connect to bus stops.
Kansas City ran a famously unsuccessful pilot project in partnership with the now-defunct microtransit service Bridj. Over the course of the yearlong, $1.5 million pilot, people took just 1,480 rides. That means the city subsidized the service to the tune of $1,000 per ride.
Fried doesn’t see Via boosting light rail ridership. Microtransit, he said, can complement public transit in situations where people might not be able otherwise to get to a train station. But it is not a comprehensive solution to the “last-mile problem.”
“It would be a mistake for transit agencies and cities to rely on this kind of last-mile connection to the exclusion of making better walking and biking connections to transit hubs,” he said. “Those are also very low-cost ways to make it easier to connect to transit.”
Gifford said she sees a place for Via-type services in the agency’s future.
“Metro’s becoming a mobility agency,” she said. “It means that we’re trying to do what we do best,  which is providing really great high-capacity fixed route transit and working with communities to complement that fixed route service with a range of other options that fit that community.”
Gifford said it will be evaluated by a number of metrics to decide whether it’s worth continuing past the first year or expanding.
“We’ll look at ridership surveys, feedback, focus groups,” Gifford said. “We’ll look at whether it’s changing people’s travel behavior, who’s benefiting … how we are achieving equity and accessibility for these populations.”
The Via pilot project will run through mid-April of next year. The agency will decide in early 2020 if it will continue as a permanent program.
Correction: This story has been updated to clarify that one end of a Via trip must be to or from a light rail station. A previous version of the story said trips could be to and from anywhere in the service area.

BlaBlaCar has announced the release of ‘Zero Empty Seats’: a global study into the environmental impact of car-pooling.
The report, conducted with French research institute, Le BIPE, is the first study based on real usage data from BlaBlaCar’s community of 70 million car-poolers.
Le BIPE looked at the real usage data over 12 months and surveyed the 6,884 members across eight countries.
The results show that the car-pooling initiative doubles the number of people travelling whilst operating a carbon-saving network. In total, 1.6 million tonnes of CO2 were saved by BlaBlaCar car-poolers in 2018, thanks to the relative efficiency of filled cars versus alternative modes of transport and members’ improved driving behaviours whilst carpooling.
This is equal to the CO2 absorbed in a year by a forest the size of 730,000 football pitches.
With only 1.6 per cent more cars on the road, car-pooling enables the transport of two times the number of passengers in cars (+210 per cent).
“The facts are simple – to protect the future of our environment, we must work together to take action today. These results show how car-pooling and shared mobility can significantly lower the carbon footprint of transport, without limiting travel aspirations or access to mobility,” said Nicolas Brusson, CEO and co-Founder of BlaBlaCar.
Currently, 75-80 per cent of long-distance travel in Europe is done by car, but with an average occupancy rate of only 1.9 people, most cars still have at least three seats left empty.
The Zero Empty Seats report presents four different scenarios based on ongoing innovations. From scaling car-pooling for commuting, to delivering a door-to-door travel experience, multiple levers exist to help save an annual total of 6.4 million tonnes of CO2 in 2023.

The rising number of commercial vehicles on Australian roads has led to more fatalities, crashes and poor driving attributable to heavy vehicles.
Four million, or more than 20 per cent of vehicles are commercial including 624,000 heavy vehicles as of 2016, according to the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics.
Transport Research Laboratory’s studies shows that a reduction of one kilometre an hour in speed leads to a 3 per cent drop in accidents.
Euclidic Systems chief executive and telematics (telecommunications and informatics systems) technology developer Chris Witt attributed these incidents to careless or uninformed approach to technology.
Companies can too easily blame on data fatigue or the tech user’s distance from the purchaser.
Telematics technology is often “left in a drawer” when it has the ability to produce data variables to monitor live and historical journeys, as well as location information that is integrated with compliance systems.
“The benefits of using the technology are potentially life-saving. Fewer accidents, improved safety, driver and passenger protection, reduced fuel consumption, maintenance and servicing make the case for less damage to the environment and the bottom line,” Witt said.
“There’s little monitoring, management or training, which is exactly what the technology is designed to encourage.”
Telematics technology comprises a 4G and satellite tracker for assets “off-the-beaten-track” and geo-fencing systems to monitor on and off-road assets.
The Euclidic telematics system can save 10 to 15 per cent on fuel costs alone.
“One of the features included is data-as-a-service (DaaS) to increase driver accountability and reduce running costs, while helping the environment. Above all else is the incalculable worth of improved driver, passengers and public safety,” Witt concluded.

The need of the hour is to focus on green, clean and sustainable sources of energy rather than fossil fuel-based solutions,” says Dr Dheeraj Bhardwaj, Group CEO of Dubai-based Arnab Mobility. Dr Bhardwaj, who holds an MBA from Imperial College London and a PhD in computing science from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, believes micro-mobility will play a key role in addressing the urgent issues brought upon the world by climate change – something that came into sharp focus this month with Greta Thunberg’s fiery speech at the UN.


Meanwhile, the world’s cities are getting increasingly congested, with the UAE no exception. A 2019 global survey by traffic data company Inrix showed Dubai motorists spent the equivalent of nine working days stuck in traffic last year. The study — one of the most in-depth congestion and mobility studies of its kind — found many other major cities face the same struggle.


“Global cities are currently trying to find solutions to the global warming problems mainly caused by fossil fuel vehicles,” says Dr Bhardwaj. “Also, city inhabitants and visitors struggle with first/last mile transportation, congestion and expenses. How efficient is it for a one-ton hulk of metal to take one person two to three miles? Conventional transportation systems are currently insufficient with people dealing daily with traffic, a lack of parking spaces, as well as long walks from bus stops and metro stations.”


The UAE’s need


Here in the UAE, a part of the solution may exist. Arnab Mobility is an on-demand electric scooter platform that provides residents and visitors a cost-effective means of ensuring their transportation needs are satisfied. “We aim to make all the cities we enter green, clean and smart, through reducing reliance on fossil fuel vehicles,” explains Dr Bhardwaj.


All major urban centres in the GCC and wider region face last-mile problems. The public transit systems are great, but they usually only drop you several blocks – or maybe even half a mile – from your home.




Arnab expects its shared electric scooters and e-bikes to transport riders over short distances. The firm’s e-scooters and e-bikes will provide critical first- and last-mile connections to neighbourhoods for public transit riders in cities across the UAE. “Arnab electric scooters can be charged like a mobile phone and our goal is in compliance with the standard safety laws and regulations and the UN goals for CO2 reduction,” explains Dr Bhardwaj. “Our digital platform is designed to readily integrate with city transport systems through open APIs to meet local Road and Transport Authorities safety and regulatory requirements.”




The platform is targeted at not only commuters who struggle to reach their work, appointments or home but also tourists, communities and entertainment centres, which are finding great value through the solution. “Our first couple of months of operations has achieved outstanding results and – most importantly – zero safety incidents. We can proudly claim that we have taken few cars off the street too.


“Cars often aren’t the quickest way to travel in dense, urban areas. Many cities look to bicycle-sharing services and bike lanes as a better option for shorter trips and a way to reduce carbon emissions. Urban mobility solutions such as Arnab, which starts at less than $1 (Dh3.67) a ride, are an offshoot of that.”


How it works


Arnab’s branded e-scooters and bikes will soon speckle sidewalks and public spaces all over the UAE. To ride an Arnab, you use the app to rent one for as little as Dh3, plus a per-minute charge of 0.6 fils. When you’re done, end the ride in the app, simply park the rented scooter within the designated zones and off you go – or hop into the metro or taxi to continue the trip.

Arnab Mobility – which is backed by Emirati entrepreneur Hamad Al Shamsi – believes its smart mobility solutions will make urban life simpler, affordable and joyful, with faster transit, less congestion and zero CO2 emissions.


“Our approach to capture the market share is through strategic partnerships with city authorities, property and business owners,” he says.


“We are entering into strategic partnerships, focused on innovation, data, risks, utilization, commercial aspects and safety with related entities. These partnership are focused on understanding challenges, identifying solutions and introducing innovations with a focus on green, smart cities along with creating commercial values. We are working with the leading universities/academic institutions in the region and abroad to keep abreast with the developments in technologies. We are also part of Sharjah Research Technology & Innovation Park, where we provide opportunities to young university students to work with us as interns during their academic breaks.”


While electric scooter sharing platforms have been successful in many western markets, will they hold up in the UAE’s scorching summer weather? “We are focusing attention on the daily commuters, people who travel to work and run errands, who will have to commute, no matter what the climate and temperature outside is,” explains Vaibhav Chauhan, Product Development lead of Arnab and a former E&Y and PwC consultant.
 “We are incentivizing them, making the commute easier by helping them skip the long walk under the scorching sun, reduce dependence on crowded public transport and taxis and helping them reach their destination conveniently and on time.” He adds that Arnab is focused on early morning and evening operations during summer, when temperatures are more bearable and the bulk of commutes take place. “On a technical note, our scooters are intelligently designed to withstand the extreme weather conditions, making rides smooth and safe all-round the year, across most geographies.”


The shared micro-mobility model

One of the main benefits of shared micro-mobility solutions is that they do not require investments in building new infrastructure, believes Dr Bhardwaj. “For example, many cities in the US and Europe that lack the infrastructure but have embraced micro-mobility and electric scooters have achieved this through training customers on safe riding and environmental benefits, thus shaping the customer adoption pattern.


“We look to follow in their footprints. Setting up or changing infrastructure takes time, but driving customer awareness – thereby changing the customer adoption patterns – will drive the change.”

Seemingly overnight, rent-to-ride electric scooters landed on city streets all across the country. In no time, the tiny two-wheelers jettisoned local governments to iron out legislation that would both allow the new forms of mobility and protect public welfare, outlining where the scooters can be used and parked.
In 2018 the rapid rise of e-scooter operations zipped past bikes as the preferred vehicle for dockless vendors, supplying some 38.5 million rides, according to a new report by the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO). Today, more than 85,000 app-based scooters are available for rent in about 100 U.S. cities.
The rise in scooters and other forms of micro-mobility should signal a clear message to cities that they are here to stay and need to be planned for, say officials.
“As stewards of the public realm, it is vital that cities retain authority over their streets,” said Alex Engel, a communications spokesman for NACTO. “When cities, system operators and communities plan together, cities can ensure the best outcomes for their residents: providing truly reliable, affordable and easy-to-access transportation, expanding access to opportunity.”
The scooters fall into the same transportation category as bicycles. By this reasoning, they are low-impact forms of transit that do not require much infrastructure and represent a form of transportation that is both sustainable and does not contribute to traffic congestion. Scooters and bikes also represent an increasingly popular form of transportation for short trips and provided 84 million trips in 2018 — more than double the number of trips taken in 2017, according to the NACTO figures.
Cities and transit agencies have caught on to this micro-mobility trend, looking for opportunities to partner transit trips with a scooter or bike trip to close first-mile-last-mile gaps — moves largely lauded by transit advocates.
“To us, it’s not a problem if someone is replacing a two-mile transit trip with a two-mile scooter trip,” said Steven Higashide, director of Research at the TransitCenter, a transit research foundation in New York City. “Those are very space-efficient modes. They’re good for cities. That’s not a bad thing.”
And to be clear, if public transit seems to be in a rut — 2018 marked yet another year of transit ridership decline — bikes and scooters are probably not the culprit. Public transit agencies still supplied some 9.2 billion trips in 2017.
One of the shifts in micro-mobility that seems to be sitting well with riders is toward dockless vehicles, like e-scooters. In other words, systems that do not require the user to return the vehicle into a docking station and can simply park it at a bike rack or out-of-the-way location off a sidewalk.
“In the early days of micro-mobility,” said Regina Clewlow, CEO of Populus, a shared mobility data platform, “the Populus team found through our representative data from cities across the U.S. that dockless services — bike, e-bikes and scooters — were rapidly become more popular than existing docked bike-share services.”

However, several large cities, such as New York, Boston and the California Bay Area, have expanded their fleets of station-based bike systems, contributing to a 9 percent increase in use in 2018, compared to 2017.
The growth in dockless micro-mobility has been fueled by vast amounts of venture capital invested into various operators, said Clewlow, coupled with the ease of accessibility and the rise of smartphone-enabled mobility apps like Uber or Lyft.
The NACTO report found that when given a choice, riders tend to prefer e-bikes over conventional bikes, and more than half of bike-share rides are work- or transit-related. In fact, large bike-share systems like New York’s Citi Bike logs four rides per day, per bike across 12,000 bikes (including the winter months), the report found.
Some of this increase has to do with the changing nature of New York City streets, which are becoming more bike-friendly as the city rolls out better infrastructure, even though gaps still exist, said Jon Orcutt, a communications spokesperson for Bike New York, a safety and advocacy group.
“We have a lot of missing links,” said Orcutt. “[Like] when you have a really good protected bike lane, but then it drops you off into traffic.”
Despite the gaps in bike lanes, cycling is the fastest growing form of transportation in New York City, said Orcutt, though acknowledging that this could be due, in part, to slowdowns, delays and overcrowding associated with the public transit system.

The last-mile delivery is expensive and difficult. It’s also high stakes, a failed delivery attempt is enough to damage the customer’s perception of the entire shopping journey.
In an attempt to ease these pain points, technology companies, retailers and logistics businesses have been piloting autonomous delivery robots to transport packages to shoppers’ doors.
In February FedEx announced it will work with retailers such as Lowe’s, Pizza Hut, Target, Walgreens and Walmart to help fulfill customer’s same day deliveries. The logistics giant joins the likes of Amazon, Starship Technologies and Australia Post which have all experimented with the delivery vehicles.
Fedex unveiled its Same Day Bot earlier this year
Fuelled by growing ecommerce sales, the robots promise faster, cheaper and more sustainable deliveries but so far deployments have not progressed passed pilot phase. However the market could shift quickly within five to 10 years, according to analysts.
A supply chain briefing published by Gartner in January argues, while “many hurdles remain urban delivery robots are increasingly viewed as a potential option for last-mile deliveries over the next ve to 10 years.”
Gartner 2019 CIO Survey found just four per cent of the retail respondents say they will have implemented urban delivery robots as a customer fulfillment method by the end of 2019, up from just one per cent in 2018.
“Although use today is nascent, some organisations predict that 80 per cent of last-mile deliveries will be autonomous by 2025,” the authors write.
The pace of a widespread roll out its likely to be dictated by the road rules, rather than technical capability of the bots.
Dr Sue Keay is the Cyber Physical Systems Research Director at CSIRO’s Data61. Her research team includes specialists in robotics and autonomous systems as well as the sensing technology, imaging and computer vision which can be used in isolation or applied to robots to help them navigate to their destination.
It’s not so much the development of the electric vehicles that will take time, but figuring out how to deploy at a large scale them, Keay told Which-50.
“Some of the difficulties deploying the technology are not so much in the technical details, but more in the legal detail,” she said.
She explained, “It’s not legal for us to have autonomous vehicles on the road. It’s difficult for us to have these essentially autonomous vehicles crossing roads because they could be a safety hazard.”
Gartner’s Supply Chain report notes legislators in the US have begun to pass laws allowing for autonomous robots to make their deliveries.
“Legislation has passed to make self-driving robots legal on the sidewalks in the District of Columbia and Virginia, and similar laws are in the works in Florida and Idaho. The city of Dallas has approved a pilot project for sidewalk delivery robots. Other states also have expressed interest. However, some cities, including San Francisco, have banned the testing of sidewalk robots,” the authors write.
Cost Cutting
According to Bain moving goods from a transportation hub to their final destination accounts for an estimated 50 per cent of a retailer’s total fulfillment costs.
A report from KPMG predicts self-driving delivery vehicles could slash the cost of delivery to between 4 and 7 cents per mile, as the costs of the vehicle and maintenance decreases over time.
Their calculation is based on an upfront cost of $1,500 to $2,500,  making 15,000 delivery miles a year over a five-year life span. It also assumes there is no cost for parking or tolls.
“Without drivers to pay, to carry, or to protect, autonomous vehicles will be much less expensive to produce than conventional delivery vehicles,” the authors write.
“The cost of autonomous delivery will of course reduce gradually, as the expense of developing the vehicles is absorbed. But with each successive reduction, consumers will adopt online shopping and delivery in greater number and with greater enthusiasm.”
Keay noted the cost of robotics will come down as a result of the large sums currently being invested in self-driving cars, which will benefit from using use the same components.
“A lot of the sensors you need to use for something like a delivery robot, you would also use in a self-driving car. The cost of those sensors are coming down all the time,” she said.
Esky On Wheels
It was dubbed an esky on wheels, but Australia Post’s autonomous delivery robot could solve one of the company’s biggest customer experience dilemmas – missed deliveries. Theoretically, the bot could wait at your door until you got home to pick up the package, eliminating the trip to the Post Office on Saturday morning to pick up a parcel.
Australia Post conducted footpath robot trial in New Farm, Brisbane, in 2017. In its 2018 annual report, the national carrier said its “mobile parcel locker” autonomously drove 140km and made 100 successful deliveries without a single “technical or safety incident”.
Australia Post spokesperson told Which-50, “In late 2017 Australia Post trialled a mobile parcel locker over a four week period to a small number of homes in New Farm, Queensland. The trial helped us test the suitability and practicality of autonomous technology in a real space, and provided an opportunity to invite community feedback.”
Future Planning
Gartner recommends supply chain leaders monitor the progress of urban delivery pilots, including any legislation in their regions that allows or prohibits the use of mobile robots on city streets or footpaths, and assemble a team to determine cost, ROI and consumer acceptance of delivery robots.
Kaey notes any robotics deployment should be accompanied by a change in workflow processes, rather than just trying to substitute a human with a machine.
“Our observation is that a robot integration never works very well if robots are just substituted into environments where there has been no mapping of the actual business process and some analysis of where the robot is actually going to be giving you an advantage,” she said.

What is good for the country might not work for a city and what is good for a city might not work for a small community. Successful cities or communities are usually built via a bottom-up approach, called localism.
Urban planning dates back to thousands of years. The archaeological evidence at Harappa, Mohenjodaro and other such sites are a testimony to this. Be it the sanitation or the street connectivity, the planning looks way ahead of its time.

However, today, the people of the modern cities struggle to commute, breathe and carry out their routine. This can mainly be accredited to a lack of localism in planning, sudden population explosion and concentration of opportunities in a few select cities. Finding an optimal way to structure cities is an evergreen subject and today it even incorporates modern-day machine learning techniques to find the right solution to improve livability.
 
Exploiting Mobility Maps
The use of mobility data previously was restricted to cell carrier logs or location “check-ins”, which was limited to the availability of the telecom providers. This method ignores the cross-border movement and other long-distance travels. 
Today, the de-identified aggregate flow of people is computed using location sensors on smartphones. Now this metric, say the researchers, can be exploited to plan the way cities are organised.
In their paper titled, “Hierarchical Organisation of Urban Mobility and Its Connection with City Livability”, the researchers at Google demonstrate how the classification of cities can be done using location history and how this, in turn, will result in indicators that help provide better insights of a city’s mobility.
In this work, the authors even went as far as suggesting practices like congestion-pricing to disincentivise private transportation to socioeconomic hubs, along with building public transportation in a targeted fashion to directly connect the hotspots in the cities.
However, tracking mobility also opens up a whole new can of worms in the form of privacy concerns.
The data for this experiment has been collected from 300 million users. Now, this raises the question of how the privacy of each user will be maintained. Because, why would anyone in their right mind want to encourage freelance stalking?
Assessing Mobility While Preserving User Privacy
If the users’ data that is being tracked to optimise urban planning is made vulnerable to malicious players, it can doom the whole plan.
To tackle this while keeping intact the AI principles, machine learning developers at Google also came up with a method to preserve privacy. 
Representative models of aggregate data are created using a technique called differential privacy. Population flows within a certain are aggregated using differential privacy along with k-anonymity.
The concept of k-anonymity deals with anonymisation of data. The individuals who are the subject of any data cannot be re-identified without degrading the usability of the data itself.
Whereas, differential privacy is any system where the results from the data do not give away what went into producing such results.
Google implements differential privacy by adding noise randomly to the data in such a way so that the accuracy of the data is maintained at an aggregate level.
GOOGLE’S ANTITRUST PROBE AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR INDIA
For example, time is discretised into longer intervals. Days become weeks, latitude/longitude coordinates become the name of the areas. By aggregating information into a larger spacetime bucket, the developers believe that this can even protect the privacy of large groups or communities.
These aggregations are deployed as differential privacy filters and the output looks like some anonymised mobility map.
Why India Needs This

Tracking mobility maps gives an idea of the city and its impact on the citizens. For instance, researchers point out of the mobility of Paris and Los Angeles vary drastically.
While Paris is mono-centric, Los Angeles displays polycentric traits. Not to forget that these two cities have similar population sizes. The hierarchy of cities and the hotspot of activities requires composite indices built up from factors like land use, the density of jobs, street geography and other key variables.
When it comes to understanding the effects of rapid urbanisation there can’t be many better use cases than that of India.
India’s tryst with developing smart cities is more than half a decade old now, and there have been multiple initiatives by the government’s planning bodies like NITI Aayog to verify this. With population densities such as that of India, there can’t be a better way to test the efficacy of the above-mentioned techniques. Densely populated cities like Delhi, Mumbai and other metros can leverage the mobility maps to build cities that connect all sections of society in a hassle-free way.
Google Maps is already being used to track live traffic data and public bus schedules to calculate delays and provide accurate travel times is the first product of its kind.
Techniques like differential privacy can be imbibed into the workflows of local planning bodies. Thus, as India prepares to embrace the algorithmic advancements, it is also necessary to safeguard the user information.

A friend recently called me a super woman, and maybe the title fits: I am a super commuter, joined by about 29,000 others who commute 90 minutes or more each way to Silicon Valley every day.
Why do I super-commute? Because I love my Silicon Valley job, but I feel at home most in Berkeley, where I discovered myself and life in all its myriad hues.
I take two trains every weekday morning–BART and Caltrain. I am lucky because work is a 15-minute walk from Mountain View’s San Antonio station. Had my office been any further from the station, I would have looked for alternatives–maybe taking a third connection in addition to my second train. But that would add another 30 minutes to my dedicated 140–minute commute. For times when I need to attend meetings outside my office, I do rely on the transit network companies–like Uber and Lyft–for my last-mile connection. And I have almost come to accept the negative implications of that choice.
The last-mile connection, the bane of our transit system, is a tough nut to crack. Transit proponents have been calling attention to the ‘death spiral’ in local transit for some time now. Periods of service cuts and fare increases impact ridership that leads to more cuts and so on. The hyper growth of Ubers and Lyfts fill that gap and while these services satisfy transit riders like me, we are well aware of the serious ways in which they challenge the system. 
The transportation infrastructure in the Bay Area could not function if everyone were to commute by car, through private use or via use of services such as Lyft and Uber. But car use is increasing in the Bay Area. Both for ethical and practical reasons, we must bring our attention to commuters who can’t afford to switch to cars and are affected by several cumulative issues—including the lack of affordable housing options in job-rich areas and an inevitable dependency on an unreliable public transportation system to navigate between home and work. For these commuters, navigating everyday can be a staggering set of circumstances.
How do we improve this situation? Several organizations are building support for a 2020 regional transportation measure that would raise up to $100 billion to ease transportation gridlock across the nine-county region. Those involved in these efforts include business and civic institutions affiliated with the “Faster Bay Area” campaign, and transit advocates, labor groups and environmentalists that are coalescing under the “Visions for Public Transportation” umbrella.
Here’s just one way a regional transportation funding measure could help: We need straightforward improvements in local bus operations that, for instance, can make transit frequent enough to help a high school student attend after school programs or help a senior to get to the local grocery store. More than 2 million young, elderly and disabled people ride transit in our region. In addition, local bus improvements could reduce occasional reliance on cars for 100,000 workers like me who usually take mass transit.
Whether one is a super-commuter or not, it’s clear to all Bay Area residents that we need an intentional, coordinated, regional effort to improve our buses, trains, light rail and bikeways to allow people to move between home, work and school more efficiently in the decades to come. And we need an ongoing source of funding for these improvements.
My organization, Silicon Valley Community Foundation, along with our nonprofit partners TransForm and Urban Habitat, recently convened a forum at which experts from the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Seattle–two cities that have passed similarly large-scale-regional transportation measures–discussed relevant lessons for the Bay Area.
One consistent theme throughout was for the measure to prioritize equity for lower-income residents and people with disabilities through affordable and reliable transportation choices. To quote a panelist, Thea Selby of SF Transit Riders: “Freedom of movement is a human right.” Both Los Angeles and Seattle prioritized bus operations and keeping fares low amidst other capital-intensive investments. A high-quality, accessible transportation system that reduced carbon emissions was a necessary component. But it was equally crucial that the system support the economic security of low-income people by providing access to good paying jobs.
The revenue source for the measure–currently a point of contention among the campaigners–tests our commitment to put equity in the center of several considerations within the regional transportation measure. Sales tax has historically been a primary revenue source in successful transportation measures over the years–including Los Angeles’ Measure M and Seattle’s ST3 as well–but sales tax is regressive. It by nature takes a larger proportion from the incomes of low-wage earners than from high-income people. The general public often misses this inherent inequity. Are there other alternatives for funding Bay Area transportation?
Ultimately, as in L.A. and Seattle, we will need a strong coalition both to win a campaign and implement the broader vision. Both the “Faster” and the “Visions for Public Transportation” campaigns must continue to seek compromise and alignment on several issues, including the extent to which funding will rely on progressive or regressive revenue sources.
The writer Toni Morrison talked about the need to engage in “constructive conflict,” one that “recognizes legitimate oppositions, honest but different interpretations of data, contesting theories” in order to win democratic struggles. I get up every morning to complete my “super commute” to do precisely that, engage in that conflict. I am happy about my role in advancing efforts to convene diverse stakeholder perspectives. I am not happy if I am complicit in thwarting mobility choices for people who are silently suffering.
 Improving regional transportation is a unique opportunity. But we will not win a regional transportation measure in 2020 without considering the needs of the most severely impacted groups. We will win this democratic struggle only when we stand together with them.

Uber and Lyft have finally come clean: Their vehicles are causing a big share of the congestion in several American cities.
A new study jointly commissioned by the two app-based cab companies found that they have a massive footprint in San Francisco, Washington and Boston, but the companies are affecting traffic to a lesser degree in Chicago, Seattle, and Los Angeles, where private car ownership is much higher.
Both companies have experienced explosive growth in the past decade but haven’t acknowledged how much congestion they’ve caused in America’s cities — until now.
Transportation consultants Fehr & Peers compared miles traveled for ride share companies as well as private and commercial vehicles in six cities over the course of one month: September 2018. The analysis is a “high-level exercise” that help both companies understand how they contribute to congestion and “help them form appropriate narratives for both internal and external communication,” the study noted.
In other words, admit their role in jamming traffic in cities, conveniently blame household car ownership and commercial trucking for clogging most roadways, and eventually pivot to advocate for congestion pricing in other cities.
“At Uber, we’re focused on reducing the need for private car ownership while expanding transportation access for all,” the company’s Head of Global Policy for Public Transportation Chris Pangilinan wrote in a Medium post that accompanied the study. “As we continue to grow in the communities we serve, it’s important to understand how roads are being used so we can continue to work together with cities to develop the right policies that expand mobility.
Uber and Lyft are largely correct that private cars and commercial trucks, buses, and vans made up the vast majority of vehicle miles traveled in major metro areas where they have a presence. Ride share companies accounted for only one to three percent of traffic — the rest of the VMTs were made by private car drivers — but the results varied far more dramatically in each area’s urban core:
In San Francisco, 12.8 percent of total vehicle miles traveled were made in an Uber or Lyft.

In Boston, it was 7.7 percent.
In Washington, 6.9 percent.
In Chicago, 3.3 percent.
In L.A., 2.6 percent
In Seattle, 1.9 percent.

San Francisco, Boston, and Washington had a larger share of ride share vehicles than the other cities because they are “denser and more compact and contain less suburban, rural, and exurban land area,” the study said.
New York was not included in the six-city study because its transit system is so much larger than other cities in the rest of the country and car ownership remains comparatively low. Other studies have shown the crippling effects of ride share vehicles on Manhattan traffic — which led the New York State Legislature to adopt a congestion pricing surcharge on vehicles entering Manhattan’s central business district earlier this year.
But the study leaves out a lot of information, too. It doesn’t address Uber and Lyft’s effects on traffic over time or how many trips ride share companies take from public transit.
And while both companies have zealously guarded their ridership data, other traffic analysts have sought to provide a clearer view of their influence.
For instance, Schaller Consulting found in 2018 that private ride share vehicles accounted for a 180-percent increase in driving on city streets and that 60 percent of ride share users would have taken public transit or walked or biked if the vehicles weren’t available to them. And another independent study earlier this year found that ride hail companies made up more than half of San Francisco’s 62-percent jump in weekday traffic delays between 2010 and 2016.
CityLab reported that the companies, which have since gone public this spring, are being more transparent because they are looking to shape the public debate over congestion pricing. That could lead to more people choosing Uber and Lyft rides instead of commuting to work or driving into the city for a concert or a game in their own vehicles.
Uber and Lyft’s strategy for the future will be to acknowledge a role in creating more traffic in downtown areas, with plenty of supporting evidence, while vociferously blaming congestion on commercial trucks and families who choose to drive their own car over taking transit.
“The research shows that despite tremendous growth over the past decade, [Uber and Lyft] use still pales in comparison to all other traffic, and although [Uber and Lyft] are likely contributing to an increase in congestion, its scale is dwarfed by that of private cars and commercial traffic,” Pangilinan wrote in his Medium post.

The Indian shared mobility market was valued at $630.7 million in 2018, which is projected to reach $3,466.7 million by 2024, witnessing a CAGR of 27.6% during the forecast period (2019–2024). Among service types, ride hailing service dominated the market during the historical period.
Whereas, during the forecast period, the Indian shared mobility market is expected to witness the fastest growth in the two-wheeler sharing category, owing to its easy availability, time/route flexibility, and affordability (marginal premium for travel with respect to other forms of shared mobility).
The Indian shared mobility market is experiencing substantial amount of investments from major global investors. For instance, in June 2019, a scooter rental company, WickedRide Adventure Services Pvt. Ltd. (Bounce) received an investment of $72.0 million in a fresh funding round, which was led by B Capital Group and Falcon Edge Capital. With this fund, the company looks to expand out of Bengaluru into ten new cities in the coming years. Additionally, with this expansion, the company has planned to add 100,000 more scooters in its fleet in next 12–18 months, with a focus on electric scooters.
Owning a private vehicle demands a high investment, which mainly comprises vehicle cost, fuel cost, parking expense, maintenance charge, and insurance cost. In this regard, shared mobility allows user to enjoy the facilities of owning a personal vehicle, without having the need to actually own it. 
The users can make the payments on the basis of their usage only. Besides, shared mobility is extremely convenient for general public, primarily daily commuters, as they can enjoy driving to their required destination without having the hassles of owning and maintaining their own vehicles. Additionally, the users can easily access to the services by booking the vehicles, directly through the companies’ mobile applications. Thus, the cost-effectiveness and convenience of shared mobility facilitates the growth of the Indian shared mobility market.
Geographical Analysis of India Shared Mobility Market
The south region held the largest share in the Indian shared mobility market in 2018, primarily due to the fact that the majority of shared mobility service providers are present in cities in south India, including Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Visakhapatnam. Additionally, the growing demand for car hailing and rental services is boosting the market growth in the region. Whereas, the north region is the second-largest revenue generator in the market, owing to the high demand for shared mobility services among people, primarily for meeting daily commuting and outstation travel needs.
Competitive Landscape of India Shared Mobility Market
The Indian shared mobility market is consolidated in nature, with the top two players, namely, ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and Uber Technologies Inc. accounted for more than 60% of the market share in 2018. ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Ola) was the market leader 2018, which was followed by Uber Technologies Inc. (Uber), holding the second spot in the market.
Some of the other major players operating in the Indian shared mobility market include Zoomcar India Pvt. Ltd., Drivezy India Travels Pvt. Ltd., Carzonrent India Pvt. Ltd., Vogo Automotive Pvt. Ltd., WickedRide Adventure Services Pvt. Ltd., Royalbison Autorentals India Pvt. Ltd., Roppen Transportation Services Pvt. Ltd., Bashar Technologies Pvt. Ltd., Meru Mobility Tech Pvt.

United States Electric Scooter Laws
International Electric Scooter Laws

Introduction
Is your scooter legal? In a massive, growing industry, the opaque nature of the answer to this rather straightforward question borders on the comedic. Laws vary from year to year, from month to month, from state to state, and from country to country. In order to provide a bit of clarity to the micro-mobile community, we scoured through all available, current documentation to provide a definitive guide on electric scooter legality. Although Unagi is based in the United States, we spent a great deal of effort compiling information on not only the varying riding laws from state to state and in popular US cities, but also the regulations of countries around the globe. This document is a living, breathing, evolving pieces of work, and, as the legal landscape for electric scooter riding evolves and changes, this piece will change with it. If you wish to contribute to the growth and accuracy of this piece, please submit your insights to support@unagiscooters.com with relevant citations and references to support your findings. This work is intended to inure not only to the benefit of Unagi riders, but to the benefit of all environmentally conscious citizens around the world who dream of a cleaner, more efficient vehicular future. Please re-publish, share, comment, and critique this piece so that we might push forward what might come to be the most important dialectic of our time.
Background
Lawmakers and enforcers across the world have been wrestling the elephant sized conundrum of shared, electric scooters since Bird hit the scene in 2017. While the shared scooter phenomenon created a low carbon, cheap, and efficient means of transportation for millions of commuters and joy seekers worldwide, it also spurred a deluge of complaints from metropolitan pedestrians. Although scooter sharing has its benefits, it also brings about a number of obvious costs: sidewalk congestion, traffic obstruction, de-beautification, and accidents. The backlash stemming from these costs has caused governments on the city, state, regional, provincial, and in some cases, federal level – worldwide – to evaluate the social implications of electric scooters. While Unagi is not a shared, dockless scooter, government disposition to dockless scooters can, in some cases, inform its legal status. Check your country’s federal law governing electric scooter use and any city or municipality law that may be applicable to scooter status. You’ll be comforted in finding that most major countries welcome electric scooters when ridden in a responsible fashion, and some, like Sweden and Italy, offer substantial subsidies to encourage their purchase.

1. United States Scooter Laws


Alabama
Electric scooters are classified as motor vehicles and require registration tags in Birmingham. The scooter operator must also have a motorcycle license. In the city of Auburn, electric scooters are said to be unsafe and are currently not allowed to be operated on the roads of Alabama. The city of Tuscaloosa also contends the electric scooters aren’t street legal.
According to Ken Riley, Partner at Farris, Riley & Pitt, Alabama’s newly enacted electric scooter laws more clearly distinguish a scooter from a motor vehicle, which as of May 30, 2019 had not been contemplated when the laws were originally enacted. Now, municipalities are free to develop ordinances that will cater to the nuances of each community. While some cities struggle with the existence of scooter traffic, others embrace the freedoms and conveniences the concept provides. Hopefully, cities like Birmingham – who are not seeing the benefits of electric scooters – will take note from the experiences of other cities with a track record of scooter usage and work to blend together a working local law that promises freedom and safety for users and the public. The scooter world is not without controversy and it will take careful thought to create the framework of a system that can be a template that other cities can imitate.
Alaska 
There is no current information readily available regarding electric scooter law in Alaska.
Arizona 
In Arizona, electric scooters with a motor of less than 750 W of power and a top speed of less than 20 mph fall under the jurisdiction of electric or electric-assisted bicycles laws. Arizona has no state or regional law governing the use of electric bicycles, so federal laws apply. These vehicles are required to have fully operable pedals and conform to all of the safety standards of traditional bicycles. Electric scooters that fall under this classification can be ridden anywhere a bicycle can go, including sidewalks and bicycle lanes. These scooters cannot be operated in traffic lanes or on highways and cannot accommodate more than one rider. Arizona’s electric scooter policy allows scooters to be operated at a speed under 20 mph and in bike lanes. No registration or insurance is required.
Arkansas
In Arkansas, you need to be at least 16 years old to ride electric scooters. Additionally, scooters have a required speed limit of 15 mph. Shared scooters must employ an electric motor of less than 750 watts. Shared scooters shall be able to securely stand upright when parked.
California
California’s new electric scooter law passed on January 1st, 2019. Electric scooters are prohibited from traveling at speeds over 15 mph on any public road or bike lane. They are permitted to be ridden on streets where the speed limit is 25 mph, but even in such circumstances, the 15 mph restriction for scooter use stays in effect.
Delaware
A person less than 16 years of age may not operate, ride upon, or ride as a passenger on any motorized skateboard or scooter unless wearing a bicycle-type helmet in the state of Delaware. Motorized skateboards or scooters shall not be operated on public highways, streets, sidewalks, or rights-of-way located within this state. Scooters may be pushed across or along public highways, streets or sidewalks, when the powertrain is disengaged.
Florida
In Florida, electric scooters without a seat are not street-legal and cannot be operated either on the road on sidewalks. Electric scooters do not require registration, and riders over the age of 16 need not wear helmets while riding. However, riders still need to be licensed to ride a motorized scooter in Florida, though any driver’s license is accepted.
Georgia
The state of Georgia allows its residents to operate electric scooters on bike paths, bike lanes, and on roads with a speed limit of 35 mph or less if no bike lane or path is available.
Illinois
Illinois requires all registered vehicles, including mopeds, scooters(or motor-driven cycles) and motorcycles, to maintain liability insurance, which covers damage to others and their property in the event of an accident.
Indiana
In Indianapolis, operators cannot ride an electric scooter on the sidewalk, cultural trail or any of the greenways. Operators must ride electric scooters on the street, following all normal traffic laws. They cannot ride in the bike lane, travel the wrong way on a one-way street; and as with cars, operators must ride with the flow of traffic. One cannot ride the electric scooters in the oncoming traffic lane. Helmets are recommended but not yet required, and electric scooters must be parked leaving four feet of clearance on the sidewalk.
Iowa
A bill moving through the Iowa House Transportation committee defines electric scooters as scooters that weigh less than 100 lbs and are equipped with two or three wheels, handlebars, a floorboard capable of supporting a standing rider, and are powered by the rider or an electric motor capable of speeds up to 20 mph. The bill proposes to treat scooters as bicycles, allowing them on roads, sidewalks, and bikeways.
Kansas
Riders may not operate bikes or electric scooters on sidewalks; they must ride in the street and stay in bike lanes wherever possible. Electric scooters may not be used on sidewalks, and although helmets are encouraged, they are not required. Riders should park scooters close to existing bike parking racks. Riders must also keep electric scooters away from entryways. This includes entrances to businesses, crosswalks, or anywhere else they could pose a tripping hazard to pedestrians. Only riders with valid driver’s licenses may operate electric scooters.
Kentucky
Electric scooters are treated the same as bicycles under Kentucky law, with no requirement to register them with the state or purchase insurance. Scooters can be parked on sidewalks as long as they don’t impede pedestrian traffic. The state of Kentucky does not list any helmet requirements.
Louisiana
According to the DMV, Louisiana allows electric, low-speed scooters to operate on sidewalks, bicycle paths, and highways with posted speed limits of 25 mph or less. Only one person is allowed on the scooter at a time. Helmets must be worn while operating scooters.

Electric scooter operators must always ride to the furthest right side of the road unless the rider is passing another motorist or making a left turn. Electric scooters are not permitted to be operated faster than 20 mph. When riding at night, a scooter must be equipped with, a front light that emits white light visible from at least 200 feet away and a back light or reflector that emits red or amber light visible for at least 200 feet behind your scooter. Electric scooters must also have reflectors.
Maryland
Dockless electric scooters must be equipped with brakes with concealed brake wires, an operational kickstand or other structural feature, so that the vehicle can be stably parked upright, without needing to lean on any structure or object, front and rear lights which illuminate while the dockless vehicle is in use, a decal listing the name of the Permit Holder, a toll-free telephone number and website address on each Dockless Vehicle stating how to report an incorrectly parked dockless vehicle or a dockless vehicle in need of repair, and a unique identification number. Scooters must additionally be equipped with a speed governor that ensures the vehicle will not travel in excess of 15 miles per hour on level ground and which can be programed to “geo-fence” a reduced speed at locations identified by the department of transportation.


Massachusetts
A bill is in consideration that would require electric scooter riders to wear a helmet if under the age of 16, yield to people walking, and to provide an audible signal when passing. The bill also states that scooters would be prohibited from blocking vehicles or pedestrian traffic when parked. Motorized would also be required to have brake lights and turn signals.
Michigan
An electric scooter is classified as a wheeled device that has a floorboard designed to be stood upon when riding that is no more than 60 inches long and 18 inches wide, is designed to transport only one person at a time, has an electrical propulsion system with power of no more than 2,500 watts, and has a maximum speed on a paved level surface of not more than 25 mph. Scooters are only allowed on streets or highways with speed limits of less than 25 mph, except when crossing. Scooters must be ridden as near to the right side of the roadway as is practicable. Operators must ride no more than 2 abreast (side-by-side). Scooters cannot pass other vehicles between lanes of traffic and cannot operate on a roadway between one-half hour after sunset and one-half hour before sunrise unless the scooter is equipped with a white light on the front that is visible from at least 500 feet away and a reflector on the rear that’s visible from up to 600 feet when in low beam headlights from a motor vehicle. Riders under 12 are not able to operate scooters on roadways, streets, or the highway.
Minnesota
Electric scooters or motorized foot scooters are categorized as devices that riders can stand or sit on (although a seat isn’t required), has handlebars, is powered by an electric motor or an internal combustion engine, has wheels no larger than 12 inches in diameter, and has a maximum speed of no more than 15 mph on a flat surface. Riders must be at least 12 years old to operate a motorized foot scooter, and you not need a license or registration.
Mississippi
A current bill would mandate that electric scooters not be allowed on sidewalks intended only for pedestrians, but could be used wherever a bicycle is allowed. Helmets are encouraged but are not required unless a rider is under 16. No children 14 years or under would be allowed to ride any electric scooter. Additionally, the bill states scooters should be parked upright and not in a manner to impede the right of way. Any scooter left for more than two days in the same spot could be removed. Scooters may not block transit stations, disabled parking spots, curb ramps, and building entrances.
Missouri
Missouri states that electric scooters should be operated in the street, or in bike lanes where available. Pedestrians always have the right away. Riders must always give a verbal warning if they are going to pass. Riders are also required to always obey the traffic controls.
Montana
In Montana, adult electric scooter riders are not allowed to ride on the sidewalk. Pedestrians always have the right away. Electric scooter riders must always give a verbal warning if they are going to pass, and must always obey the traffic controls.
Nebraska
When operating electric scooters on streets, riders must abide by the rules of the road. Users can only operate on streets, and, where available, in bike lanes. Driving on the sidewalk is prohibited.  It is unlawful for any person, whether he be the owner, driver or operator of any motorized cart, minibike, motor scooter or motorcycle, to use, operate, drive or race the same on any public property, public sidewalk or public place.

New Jersey
A new bill proposes that electric scooters can have a maximum speed of no more than 19 miles per hour. Under the bill, low-speed e-bikes and e-scooters are allowed on bike paths unless otherwise prohibited by state or local rules, but they are not generally allowed on unpaved trails.
New Mexico
In Albuquerque, city regulations include: wearing a helmet for riders under 18 years old and riding in bike lanes on the right side of the road. Sidewalk use is allowed if there is no bike lane. Riders must follow traffic laws, signals and signs. Like bicycles, scooters are banned in the Albuquerque Rapid Transit (ART) lanes. Electric scooters that travel faster than 15 miles per hour are not permitted, nor is riding scooters under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
New York
State lawmakers approved electric scooters, however cities have the opportunity to decide for themselves how to regulate the vehicles. Shared scooter companies are not allowed to operate in Manhattan or heavily populated boroughs. Owning your own electric scooter in New York is legal.
North Carolina
Electric scooters are vehicles under North Carolina Law. If the sidewalk is part of the street, then the requirement is that the vehicle be registered also applies before it may be operated on the sidewalk. Riders must be 16 years or older, according to the city ordinance. While not required, riders are encouraged to wear a helmet.
North Dakota
Electric scooter riders are required to stay off sidewalks and bike paths. They are also required to obey all traffic laws and regulations. Electric scooters must have brakes, a headlight, and taillight. Riders must wear a motorcycle helmet if under the age of 18.
Ohio
To ride electric scooters, operators don’t need a motorcycle or motor scooter license. Electric scooters are generally legal to ride on streets or in bike lanes, though regulations about where one can ride may vary based on specific city ordinances. Ohio helmet laws do not require that electric scooter riders wear helmets. Ohio motor scooter owners are required to maintain the same minimum level of liability insurance as motorcycle owners. If one rides an electric kick scooter, moped or motorized bicycle, he or she does not have to have insurance.
Oklahoma
Under Oklahoma City ordinance, it’s illegal to operate electric scooters along city sidewalks. Initially, Oklahoma police states that it was illegal to operate scooters along city streets, but later clarified that there was not an ordinance that explicitly banned the use of motor scooters. Another ordinance prohibits anyone under 18 from operating or riding a motor scooter without a helmet.
Oregon
Using an electric scooter on the sidewalk and in crosswalks is prohibited. People using electric scooters are allowed on Portland city streets, multi-use paths and in bike lanes. People using electric scooters are required to wear a bicycle helmet. Youth under age 16 are prohibited from riding electric scooters. People using an electric scooter are required to yield to pedestrians. Motorized wheeled devices are prohibited in parks, except on park roads, or in designated vehicle parking areas, or by permit.
Pennsylvania
Electric scooters are illegal to use on roads in Pennsylvania because “these vehicles do not comply with the equipment standards and inspection requirements for motor vehicles, and cannot be titled or registered in the commonwealth,” according to the Pennsylvania department of transportation. “In addition, these vehicles cannot be operated on Pennsylvania roads and sidewalks.”
Rhode Island
Rhode Island’s electric scooter pilot program requires a valid driver’s license or municipal ID. Scooters can be ridden on sidewalks or streets, and riders are encouraged to go slow and wear a helmet. On the street, riders are required to follow all rules of the road and obey traffic regulations.
South Carolina
While statewide electric scooter law has yet to be ratified, rideshare scooters from companies like Lime and Bird are banned in the city of Columbia for one year.
South Dakota
Rider under the age of 18 must wear a helmet at all times when riding (even if they are riding as a passenger.) Riders must wear eye protection while driving unless the scooter is equipped with a windscreen that is big enough to provide adequate eye protection.
Riders have to be seated and facing forward while driving, and can’t drive on sidewalks, footpaths, or highways. Riders can’t carry a package or any other object that would prevent you from having both hands on the handlebars or hinder your vision. Riders can’t drive between lanes of traffic and need to change lanes when passing a vehicle. Riders can’t ride side-by-side with other vehicles in the same lane, except for 1 other moped. Riders can’t “hitch a ride” by attaching themselves to another vehicle and can’t carry a loaded firearm while riding.
Tennessee
Under proposed legislation, electric scooters would be required to have brakes, a white light on the front of the scooter and a red light or reflector on the back. No scooter could be used on any sidewalk, unless the use of bicycles on sidewalks is authorized by a local government. The proposed legislation also states that a scooter may be parked on a sidewalk if it doesn’t impede reasonable movement of pedestrians. Under the state’s proposed legislation, cities can still prohibit scooters from certain trails and paths with local resolutions and ordinances. No scooter can be used by more people than it was designed for.
Scooters should be ridden as close as practical to the right-hand curb or edge of the road, unless passing another vehicle traveling in the same direction, making a left-hand turn or when needing to avoid an object, vehicle or pedestrian. Electric scooters should not travel faster than 15 mph. A person shouldn’t carry an item while riding a scooter if it prevents them from keeping at least one hand on the handlebars.
Texas
In Texas, a motor-assisted scooter may be operated only on a street or highway for which the posted speed limit is 35 mph or less. Traffic laws which apply to bicycles also apply to motor assisted scooters and the operator must obey the usual traffic laws that bicycle operators must obey such as speed limit, signal turns, etc. There are some laws that apply to a motor vehicle do not apply to electric scooters, for example, riders do not need a safety inspection, a driver’s license, registration or insurance to operate an electric scooter with up to 750 W motor.
Utah
In Utah, to ride an electric scooter, there is no requirement to have a driver’s license or driver’s permit. But, there are age restrictions. Anyone under 15 years old must be in the direct supervision of a parent or guardian. Children under 8 years old are not allowed to ride scooters on public property, this includes sidewalks, pathways, and roadways. Children under 8 years old are not allowed to ride scooters, and if they do, their parents or guardians may be ticketed. A person may not operate a motor assisted scooter (electric scooter) in the following areas: in a public parking structure; on public property posted as an area prohibiting skateboards; on a highway consisting of a total of four or more lanes designated for regular vehicular traffic; on a highway with a posted speed limit greater than 25 miles per hour.
Vermont
Scooters and electric bicycles are treated as vehicles and must ride on roadways and not sidewalks. The default for maximum e-assist scooter speed is 15 mph maximum. Riders must still follow all existing regulations and applicable laws.

Virginia
While statewide scooter information on Virgina is not available, information on regulations in Arlington County is accessible. In Arlington, riders have to be at least 16 years of age, but don’t have to wear a helmet. The county asks people not to park scooters in travel lanes, blocking walkways, blocking driveways, or at entrances to buildings. The county also states there is no regulation that prohibits riders from operating scooters on sidewalks. However, off-street bicycle paths may not be used by electric scooter riders. Scooters must be parked on public sidewalks or at bike racks, but not in a way that they are an obstruction.
Washington
In Washington, riders can operate their electric scooters on roadways, on highway shoulders, and in alleys. Riders cannot operate on sidewalks, bike lanes, or other public walkways, or on any roadway where the speed limit exceeds 35 mph. Riders cannot operate an e-scooter on playgrounds or schoolyards. Riders who suffer from a disability and use their e-scooter to increase mobility can operate their vehicle in any of the previously mentioned locations, except on roadways that exceed 35 mph.
West Virginia
All mopeds must be titled and registered through the local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Riders and passengers must wear helmets while operating the moped. A moped’s handlebars must not exceed the height of the seat by more than 15 inches. Riders must keep their seats in proper adjustment while riding. Riders must not carry passengers unless their vehicles are specifically made to do so. This means obtaining a vehicle with a second seat or a sidecar. Riders must equip their moped with a rearview mirror that is visible while operating the vehicle. Riders must obey the same traffic laws, lights, as other roadway vehicles do.
Wisconsin
The Wisconsin state Assembly has signed off on a bill to regulate electric scooters on roads and sidewalks. According to the measure, scooters must weigh less than 100 pounds and abide by a 15 mph speed limit. Local governments could prohibit their use on sidewalks or streets with speed limits of more than 25 mph as well as restrict public rentals.
Wyoming
There is no current, available information on electric scooter law in the state of Wyoming.

Electric Scooter Use in the USA
At the onset of the e-scooter legality debate in the United States, it seemed as though electric scooter regulation would fall under the auspices of a 2002 federal law governing electric bike classification. According to this law, an electric bike would be considered street legal if its maximum speed could not exceed 20 mph and possessed a motor under 750 W of power. If at or below these specifications, these bicycles would not require that their riders obtain any type of registration.  Over time, the United States Department of Transportation – through its National Highway Traffic Safety Administration division – came to define when scooters would not qualify as motor vehicles (and be subject to their standards). According to the NHTSA website:
The following scooters or scooter-like vehicles are not “motor vehicles” that must be manufactured to comply with all applicable FMVSS and be so certified to be lawfully imported into the United States:

Scooters lacking seats that are operated in a stand-up mode.
Scooters that are incapable of a top speed of 20 mph or greater.
Electric bicycles with operable pedals, and an electric motor of 750 watts or less, whose maximum speed on a paved level surface, when powered solely by such a motor while ridden by an operator who weighs 170 pounds, is less than 20 mph.

By these standards, the Unagi qualifies as legal on the Federal level, as do many of the scooters in the ride-share department. Despite federal guidelines, many cities across the States have implemented their own regulations governing electric scooter use. It should be noted that, at the city level, a ban on dockless electric scooters might not constitute a ban on all electric scooter use. Many cities banned the popular scooter rideshare platforms prior to instituting pilot programs to evaluate their use. During this banned period, it remains unclear whether owned electric scooters were technically allowed, but, given federal guidelines, it would seem that they indeed would have been permitted for use without explicit, specified legislation against their use.
While Bird, Lime, and its competitors can still be seen scattered across Los Angeles through the city’s pilot scooter share program, the once omnipresent brands have been ejected from New York City – which had technically implemented a ban on electric scooters in 2004 – but are due to return to New York in a statewide fashion (save Manhattan) in the immediate future. A facet of the Los Angeles program, which no doubt helps to eliminate many pedestrian worries, includes ridesharing companies’ staffing of 24 hour scooter removal specialists to handle scooter pickup from sensitive areas. Washington D.C. instituted a formal pilot program in 2018 for dockless scooters, and they can be ridden anywhere bike lanes exist in the city. In June of 2018, Miami banned scooter use, but has initiated a pilot program through which all major rideshare companies are allowed to deploy 50 scooters each with a flexible ceiling stretching to 100 scooters each depending on popularity. Similar pilot programs have sprouted in a number of US cities which first opposed electric scooters – like San Francisco – and other cities have lifted restrictions in even larger ways, as is the case in Boston. Given the number of cities in the States, prospective riders should refer to their local governments to make sure that federal guidelines are observed before engaging in scooter use.

2. International Electric Scooter Laws

Canada
Much like the United States, the Canadian federal government recognizes electric scooters as power assisted vehicles that do not require a specific license. The specific usage of scooters however, is determined at the local level. Also, much like in the States, regions and cities in Canada that once opposed electric scooter use have instituted ride-share pilot programs, like Calgary and Quebec. Again, as in the States, there seems to be a dislocation between general electric scooter use as determined by the Canadian federal government and the acceptance of dockless scooter programs on the municipal level. Indicators would point that owned, personal electric scooters are a green light unless otherwise prohibited in major Canadian cities.
The United Kingdom
Unlike electric bikes, electric scooters are classified as personal, light electric vehicles and are only legal for use on private land. It will be interesting to see how this regulation might change over time, and British scooter enthusiasts should refer to their local governments prior to making a purchasing decision.
France
Recently, France instituted a law that permits electric scooters to be ridden on cycling paths or the street, but prohibits their use on sidewalks. This stems from the same types of complaints issued by pedestrians in the United States surrounding scooter littering and congestion brought on by the ridesharing model.
Germany
Germany’s Minister of Transport, Andrea Scheuer, passed a bill governing electric scooter use this Spring which paved a way for a cleaner, more efficient Germany. According to the bill, electric scooters with a maximum speed of 20 km/h would be allowed to be ridden on bike paths or lanes by civilians 14 years of age or older. Scooters with a maximum speed of 12 km/h are allowed to be operated on bike lanes, paths, and on sidewalks by children 12 years of age and older.
Italy
Italian law appears relatively friendly toward electric scooters, going as far as to offer a 30 % subsidy to purchasers of electric scooters with performance matching a 125 cc combustible engine – maxing out at around 30mph – if the buyer scraps an older, gas powered scooter in the process. The country’s capital, Rome, accepted a plan in January to prepare for the launch of dockless scooters, and seems open to all electric vehicles. Again, it is best to check with your local authority, but Italy remains one of the more enthusiastic electric vehicle supporters in Europe.

Sweden
In August of 2018, Daniel Hellden, Transport Minister of Sweden, gave dockless scooters his seal of approval. Since then, the use of e-scooters – particularly in Stockholm – has come under scrutiny following a fatality and many minor accidents and injuries. For now, it would seem that electric scooters are still encouraged, with a purported government subsidy of 25 %.
Spain
Dockless scooters caused a stir in late 2018 when they hit major metropolitan cities in Spain, which have thus far worked to launch somewhat prohibitive regulation. While these laws vary city to city, Barcelona prohibits electric scooters on sidewalks and walkways, but allows them in bike lanes and those with unique platforms that accommodate both pedestrians and riders.
Mexico and Latin America
In July of last year, dockless scooter startup Grin began to penetrate both Mexico and Latin America without much opposition. Lime can be found in Mexico City, Bird has plans to launch in Brazil, Cosmic Go is visible in Columbia, and Movo is working to launch in Mexico, Peru, Columbia, and Chile. The list of active entrants into the Latin American shared scooter market continues, and it would appear that most larger countries are favorable towards e-scooters, but, as always, check local law before committing to a purchase.
South Korea
Although electric scooters can be seen lined across the sidewalks of South Korean cities nationwide, the country’s federal Road Traffic Act categorizes and treats PMD’s (one-person vehicles powered by electricity) as motorcycles, requiring riders to stay in car lans and wear helmets. In addition, riders over the age of 16 are technically supposed to have a license. That said, riders typically don’t follow these rules, and enforcement has been historically lax. Interestingly, although the current law has categorized PMD’s as motorcycles, there is no law mandating that devices like electric scooters acquire the government safety certifications typically tied to motorcycles.
While federal regulations have yet to be amended, The Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy has begun a sandbox program in Gyeonggi province (which contains Seoul) to allow the use of electric scooters in bike lanes as long as riders demonstrate responsible practices and operate vehicles with 15.5 mph caps. Amendments to federal regulation are currently being discussed in The National Assembly, but there is no speculative date on the adoption of new PMD law.

Last-mile delivery presents a challenge for companies across all types of industries. But now, more and more industry players are turning to autonomous solutions  — in the form of driverless delivery vehicles.
Filling gaps in the supply chain, these autonomous vehicles (AVs) are being used to deliver products for grocers, retailers, and various other businesses.
Autonomous Vehicles and Last-Mile Delivery
If you think e-commerce shook up the supply chain, you’re in for a shock, according to KPMG’s automotive sector leader Gary Silberg. “E-commerce,” he said, “has been a tremor, but autonomous delivery vehicles now represent an earthquake of a magnitude not seen before.”
Using natural language processing, artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computer networking, so-called “islands of autonomy” in metropolitan markets will fundamentally change local order fulfillment.
KPMG further predicts:

Delivery vehicle miles traveled (VMT) could reach 78 billion VMT per year by 2040 as companies strive to meet customer demand for same-day, or even same-hour, delivery
New service and business development for building, routing, cleaning, charging, and maintaining the new AVs
Introduction of loading and unloading zones, as well as spaces for delivery lockboxes to accommodate driverless delivery vehicles

“Shopping and last-mile logistics will never be the same.” — KPMG
Whether customers will embrace the driverless delivery vehicle remains to be seen; several recent news stories have reported on incidents of individuals attacking driverless cars, and in a Brookings study from July 2018, only 21% of adult internet users said they would be willing to ride in such a vehicle. Yet the business benefits of this trend are clear.
Driverless Delivery Vehicle Testing
Today’s customers have high expectations for delivery fulfillment. And through the use of autonomous vehicles, deliveries are expected to become both faster and cheaper.
Ford is already testing autonomous vehicle delivery on the streets of Miami and anticipates the deployment of tens of thousands of self-driving vehicles in multiple cities beginning in 2021. Why? “The opportunity of that market is massive,” said Sherif Marakby, president of Ford Autonomous Vehicles. “It’s a margin that is like no automotive markets today.”
Ford has also partnered with Walmart and logistics company Postmates to design self-driving vehicles that will deliver goods ordered from the retail giant’s stores to customers’ doorsteps. Ford has said it plans to invest a total of $4 billion in AV technology through 2023.
Toyota, General Motors (GM), Google, and Apple are also investing in autonomous vehicles. Toyota, for example, revealed the e-Palette at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show; the company hopes that this autonomous vehicle will be delivering pizzas as early as 2020 — potentially with a chef in tow cooking up the pizzas to order. Toyota says it will work with Amazon, Didi Chuxing, Mazda, Pizza Hut, and Uber to make this a reality.
Kroger, meanwhile, went with an AV startup to try out driverless delivery on the streets of Scottsdale, Arizona. The grocer is trusting Nuro to handle last-mile delivery in this densely populated region, with product loaded in temperature-controlled compartments.
In China, e-commerce behemoth Alibaba already uses driverless robots to deliver goods to a secure e-locker. The robot, called the G Plus, can run up to 9 miles an hour.
And in Silicon Valley, a leading Seoul-based AV startup, ThorDrive, launched its self-driving delivery service for the Ace Hardware retailers’ cooperative, starting with Hassett Ace Hardware in Palo Alto, California.
Driving Into an Autonomous Future
KPMG predicts that autonomous delivery vehicles will:

Dramatically change the consumer e-commerce experience
Drive consumer demand for faster, easier deliveries
Create a totally new product-delivery ecosystem 

McKinsey expects autonomous ground vehicles to be used most often in the last-mile delivery market in urban areas for regular, high-reliability, or same-day delivery, while drones and droids will be more likely to handle rural areas and faster fulfillment requirements.

“With the Electronic Logging Device (ELD) mandate in the books, mobile devices in vehicle cabs are now commonplace,” explained Gina Daniel-Lee, VP Strategic Alliances and Partnerships at https://www.stratixcorp.com. “These phones and rugged tablets can help fleets distinguish themselves from the pack by leveraging telematics technology that takes a big bite out of waste and boosts profit margins every day.
“A typical over-the-road fleet can spend up to 40% of its time idling, with a lead-foot driver using up to 20% more fuel than the average trucker. With smartphones and tablets linking drivers and dispatchers, trucking fleet management technology can do away with overspending and improve overall safety.”
Daniel-Lee offered 10 benefits that telematics technology can deliver for trucking fleet management.
• Increase efficiency. Drivers who know their behavior is being monitored tend to perform according to company and regulatory standards, which can reduce accidents and damage to vehicles and freight.
• Increase job satisfaction. With electronic logs, drivers have more control over their daily routines, which is one of the top contributors to job satisfaction. The drivers know how much time they have left to work and can better collaborate with dispatchers to meet customer demands. Having smartphones and tablets with them at all times, they can engage in training at a time and place that’s convenient for them.



• Reduce operating costs. Saving even a few minutes of idling time across a fleet leads to huge fuel savings. Better fleet and driver utilization can lift equipment availability to meet customer demand with existing assets. Connecting with drivers via cab-mounted tablets, fleet managers can instantaneously update drivers on detours, reroute them around heavy traffic and direct them to preferred fuel vendors.



• Monitor safety habits. With connected trucks, management can view how fast vehicles are being driven, how quickly they accelerate from a stop and other indicators of driver behavior. Drivers can be rewarded or counseled based on their performance relative to regulations and standards.
• Optimize vehicle performance. Vehicle sensors can deliver alerts about engine problems and other diagnostic issues, while informing routing centers when a vehicle is out of service. The cache of vehicle data can help drive fleet overhaul and replacement planning as well.
• Schedule alerts for repair centers. Wired vehicles can monitor vehicle diagnostics and contact repair centers with proactive schedule alerts. This allows drivers and managers to plan for maintenance rather than running a truck to the point of failure.
• Streamline compliance. Despite the December 2017 deadline for the ELD mandate, 43.7 percent of out-of-service violations were related to HOS tracking during the 2018 RoadCheck enforcement event. Fleets need to be more proficient with mobile telematics technologies to improve compliance.
• Retain/attract drivers. Mobile technology can increase connectivity for drivers who often feel disconnected by allowing them to virtually attend company meetings, while also improving daily communication with their managers.
• Enhance security. Storing both company and personal data on mobile devices has become possible. With this technology, drivers can still use company-issued tablets for entertainment and communication during downtime, without compromising the security of business applications.

Gone are the days when blockchain was an unheard term. 
Now, blockchain and cryptocurrencies have become a force to be reckoned with. According to TechJury, the blockchain market is expected to reach a whopping value of 20 billion dollars by 2024.
Moreover, as per a survey conducted by Deloitte, 53 percent of organizations terms blockchain to be a critical technology for their organization.  One sector that can benefit immensely from technology is the automotive sector.
The automotive sector has continued to have steady demand over the years. In 2017, the global car sales reached up to 78.6 million, as per Statista. Various companies have already incorporated blockchain within this sector.
According to IBM, 62 percent of the sector is set to utilize the technology in various ways by 2021. And by doing so, the traditional car business is poised to be transformed. Here are ways blockchain can impact the automotive industry in the future.

     Swift supply chain through efficient tracking

There is a lot more to producing cars than merely putting the various pieces together. Instead, each organization must also keep tabs on the different car parts. Inventory management of car parts is quite a headache for the supply chain department of car manufacturing companies.
To ensure that manufacturers know each piece that is either damaged, lost in delivery, or stolen, blockchain can be used. Blockchain, if used correctly, can carry information regarding the origin of each car part.
Since only the manufacturer can make modifications to the data, it ensures better transparency throughout the supply chain process.

     Streamlined manufacturing processes

The blockchain technology can be used in several ways to improve the manufacturing processes of the automotive industry. For instance, it can be used to store data for vehicle components via bills of lading.
Similarly, quality-inspection records can be created and altered to store WIP information regarding each car manufactured. This can help keep track of vehicle assembly from beginning to end.

     Accelerating finances

Each sector within the corporate world needs a proper and transparent finance department. Here, data insertion, transaction, expenses, and other financial aspects of the company are taken care of. Blockchain can prove to be the platform where each of these financial processes is stored.
For instance, rather than relying on manual data insertion of transactions and revisions, inventory management and its subsequent effect on different financial reports can be taken care of via blockchain.
This will help in accelerating the pace of finances and help ensure that the organization stays updated regarding its financial changes throughout the lifecycle of a given vehicle.  

     Safeguarding a connected car from cyberattacks

With each passing year, we are becoming even more dependent on IoT. We live or strive to live in a highly connected and smart world. The automotive industry, too, has begun seeing connected and smart vehicles.
One drawback of smart vehicles, which feature extensive internet connectivity, is vehicle safety and data security. The more we rely on the online world, the more vulnerable we are to cyberattacks.
Blockchain can combat this problem without relying on the traditional car model. Blockchain allows vehicles to be connected, yet have their data secured. This is because blockchain features robust cryptographic roots that are highly challenging to reverse-engineer. Hence, hackers can’t access the information stored on the platform regardless of how much they try.
In connected vehicles, telematics is often used for car-t0-car communication and software-based navigation. If hacked, such systems can compromise vehicle security immensely. But, blockchain can be combined with these systems to safeguard all the data that is sent as well as received.
By encrypting all the data, hackers cannot view your data, even if they achieve the impossible task of accessing it.

     Delivering smarter insurance

One industry that is linked with the automotive sector and until now operates on a traditional model is the car insurance industry. Blockchain technology has the power to transform this branch of the car business as well.
Blockchain technology can guarantee that no vehicle sensor data that is logged into the system is manipulated or changed. Since the platform is a decentralized system, the unmodifiable documentation of blockchain can help gain clarity about circumstances surrounding different accidents. This is especially helpful in autonomous vehicles.
By knowing the correct details about a given situation, insurance companies can better gauge how to address the different claims.

     Easy buying and selling of cars

The car buying and selling a business is a bread earner for a lot of people. Many buy a car for sale at later times.
Whether you are buying a car or selling it, vehicle verification is always a tedious task. Not to mention that the lack of transparency in vehicle history always makes such a transaction a difficult decision.
Blockchain can effectively revolutionize the buying and selling of cars by creating registries for each vehicle. This can help keep tabs regarding vehicle history. You can know how many times the vehicle has been serviced when it was manufactured, what the origins of its car parts are, and whether or not it has been in an accident. This can help customers get the best deal from sellers.

     Catalyst for carsharing

Carsharing has not yet seen accelerated demand and growth because of the security issues surrounding it. However, with blockchain technology, one can guarantee a secure digital identity of their cars.
Personal data exposure to unnecessary third parties can be avoided through encryption of data via blockchain.
Not to mention that the reaping benefits from various carsharing offers be fast-tracked through the blockchain technology. This is because a single registration on the ecosystem will be usable for all the service providers on the platform.
Ending Remarks
Blockchain has the power to transform and improve the car business through and through. From the moment a car is made till the moment customers use it, blockchain can streamline it all for a better experience.

Alongside “smart cities” and “transit-oriented development,” the term “mobility hubs” is joining the buzzy phrases making their mark on sustainable urban planning.
Mobility hubs are a cornerstone concept for shared mobility transit, which the Shared Use Mobility Center (SUMC) defines as “transportation services and resources that are shared among users, either concurrently or one after another.” In other words, shared mobility is the integration of traditional shared transit like buses and trains with newer forms like car share, bike share and ride hailing services.
Mobility hubs are meant to be a physical space where these different modes of transit can intersect.
Last year, Minneapolis and St. Paul were each awarded funding from the Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge to implement mobility hubs locally. While the plans remain in drafting stages, early comments suggest that more than 70 mobility hubs will be designated within 35 square miles of the metro area.
Minneapolis Sustainability Coordinator Kim Havey framed mobility hubs as one solution to the so-called first-mile/last-mile problem. As Havey explained, many people decide what types of transit to use based on the options presented in the first or last mile of a trip. By making alternative modes more convenient in this first or last mile, the idea is that mobility hubs will incentivize drivers to leave their cars at home.
Details of what these mobility hubs would actually look like are still emerging.
Havey imagines them as a kind of “public space-plus” with many amenities wrapped into one, including green space, bathrooms, electric vehicle charging stations and public art. These spaces would be accompanied by a new multi-modal transit app, providing a single technological platform to integrate transit information and synchronize payment structures.
These hubs are being championed locally though the Twin Cities Shared Mobility Collaborative, a working group of community and political leaders that is supported through SUMC, a public-interest nonprofit with offices in Chicago and Los Angeles. This working group was convened as a vehicle for implementing the Twin Cities Shared Mobility Action Plan, also a product of SUMC and funded by the McKnight Foundation.
As local mobility hub proponents argue, redesigning the transit system around shared mobility serves two basic and urgent needs.
First, as the Twin Cities continue to experience rapid population growth and worsening congestion, mobility hubs will target a pervasive reliance on single-occupancy vehicles. Second, they will incentivize greener transit alternatives and reduce carbon emissions.
Diverting cars from the road appears all the more significant since the release of The Air We Breathe 2019, a biannual report from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency that is mandated by the state Legislature.
The MPCA found that as of 2019 transportation accounted for the largest amount of statewide carbon emissions.
This finding prompted several presentations during a Valentine’s Day hearing of the House Transit Finance and Policy Committee, which was convened to discuss the relationship between transportation and climate change in Minnesota.
Alex Burns, chair of the Sierra Club’s local Land Use and Transportation Committee, sees this report as an important call for reimagining the role of transit for healthy climate futures.
“In order for us to immediately make it easier for people to get around without a car, that means all hands on deck,” he said. “We need to allow people to use all these multimodal systems until our (public) system catches up.”
But there are concerns that shared mobility solutions like mobility hubs don’t just act as a placeholder for public transit; they may actually re-enforce nonpublic models.
As international public transportation researcher Graham Currie of Australia’s Monash University argues in an explosively pointed Journal of Public Transportation article entitled “Lies, Damned Lies, AVs, Shared Mobility, and Urban Transit Futures,” a major part of the shared mobility narrative is “that public transport is old, doesn’t work, and its time as an alternative growth mode are limited.”
Dependence on private ride hailing companies like Lyft and Uber is a particular concern. While these transit modes provide key linkages for people to get from one place to the next, the reliance on private ride hailing can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
As Henry Graber wrote for Slate in 2016, “The rise of ride-hailing companies is increasingly viewed not as a fix for bad service but as its justification.”
On the other hand, a recently published study in the Journal of Urban Economics suggests that Uber’s presence in cities actually increases public transit ridership by providing connections to destinations inaccessible by public routes — the precise results that mobility hubs are striving for.
Perhaps this tension is best reflected in a blog post about shared mobility for the Eno Center for Transportation, where two transit practitioners wrote: “We are at the beginning of an important new phase in personal transportation that is both disruptive and revolutionary.”
And yet mobility hubs are actually rooted in a fairly incremental premise: There are many different ways that people get around and many different reasons (convenience, price, ability, safety) for choosing between them.
Whether or not this means transit revolution remains to be seen.

First ride for VAIMOO, the Vehicle Sharing system designed to revolutionize the urban mobility of the future and developed by the Digital Transformation division of SITAEL, the largest privately owned space company in Italy and worldwide leader in the small satellites sector. 
Based on a flexible and multi-vehicle platform, VAIMOO uses the potential of IoT technologies to offer more efficient, safe and user-friendly smart mobility services. The system has been presented during the C40 World Mayor Summit 2019, the largest climate summit involving mayors and leaders from 96 cities across the world, this year held in Copenhagen. 
The Danish capital, international centre for green mobility, will be the first city to adopt VAIMOO for its e-bike fleets, thanks to the partnership signed by SITAEL with Bycyklen, the main operator of the bike-sharing scheme in Copenhagen. 
The first stage of the agreement sees the integration of the innovative features developed by the Italian company with the Bycyklen system (with 400 thousand active users) and, starting from 2020, the current fleet will be replaced by the new generation bicycles entirely made by SITAEL, for a total amount of 2,000 e-bikes. 
A strategic project realized thanks to the close collaboration with an important operator, which has made available to SITAEL its bike sharing system and its strong skills in the field of emobility. In fact, the partnership with Bycyklen will allow VAIMOO to hit the international market and SITAEL to strengthen, thanks to the experience in hardware and software design, its role as a strategic partner to companies and institutions for the implementation of mobility services and the management of shared urban infrastructures. 
Matteo Pertosa, Chief Executive Officer of SITAEL S.p.A. claimed: ‘Sustainable mobility is the key factor in the development of Smart Cities. In the future, commuting will become more and more a shared activity that will not require the possession of a vehicle. To achieve this ecosystem, however, we need integrated mobility systems to generate high added value for the communities. VAIMOO has been designed with this intention: to offer to institutions and citizens, vehicles equipped with a multi-modal platform and connectivity services, which are able to innovate the personal transport. Today, thanks to the important agreement with Bycyklen, we are starting from Copenhagen to export our innovative model to other countries.’ 
VAIMOO will be officially presented in Paris during the Autonomy & The Urban Mobility Summit (16-17 October 2019), the annual event that brings together innovators and institutions with the aim of changing urban mobility. During these two days, will be present with its booth (A47) to introduce to the public the innovation and potential of the new system made in Italy. 
Moreover, the VAIMOO solution will be also a Smart City Expo World Congress, which will take place from 19 to 21 November 2019 in Barcelona. 
THE MODEL OF VAIMOO 
VAIMOO Vehicle-Sharing is an end-to-end sharing system based on an open mobility platform that allows the simple, effective and timely management of traditional bikes and e-bikes, but also electric scooters and kick scooters. Vehicles, equipped with a safe locking system, integrate innovative connectivity features enabling satellite geolocation, access to usage data and diagnostic information of fleets in real time. In the event of an accident or vandalism, the platform allows the timely intervention of operators and repairers of vehicles. 
On the user side, the smartphone app defines a new concept of urban mobility, offering a unique experience in terms of accessibility and usability thanks to the integration of the sharing version of MAT, the docking station awarded at the CES Innovation Awards in Las Vegas in the Vehicle Intelligence and Self-Driving Technology category. Thanks to this 
technology, with a simple tap of the smartphone, the vehicle is undocked and the sharing session starts. 
The app also offers an immersive experience of sustainable transport, enabling the access of the city map to verify the available vehicles for booking, contact the Support Team in case of malfunctioning, take advantage of promotions in order to facilitate, for example, bikes’ redistribution operations, pay automatically at the end of the riding session and top up the credit directly with the app by using a credit card or PayPal. 
In addition to the Free-Floating mode of use, the return of the vehicle and the end of the sharing session takes place in specific bike racks or in Drop Zones defined through the platform, ensuring maximum safety of the vehicles. 
Flexible and adaptable to several situations for micro-mobility public services, the platform in addition to support kick scooters and electric scooters schemes can be easily integrated with third-party systems via API.

Ride sharing on app-based taxi services is catching up. Now researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi have developed an algorithm that can guide taxi drivers to take a route where they can find more commuters for sharing. They believe this algorithm can make shared rides more profitable for drivers and reduce waiting time for commuters as well.
To make cabs more economical for customers, many taxi-service companies are promoting ride-share among commuters. Here two or more ride-orders are completed by a single taxi driver who can complete these rides without deviating much in a given travel route. The taxi company benefits from such ride shares as it increases their customer base, reduces fuel and allows them to maximize profits from limited number of vehicles.
However, often a compatible ride order may not possible on a given route due to which company may incur loss as it has to notify charges to ride-share customers even before they take a cab.
“In the current scenario, the appearance of subsequent compatible customers is left to luck — a taxi moves along the shortest (or quickest) path for the existing customer and hopes to find additional compatible customers on its way,” said Amitabha Bagchi, associate professor, IIT, New Delhi while explaining the problem to India Science Wire.
The new algorithm is more efficient in searching compatibility between ride-orders. Called ‘Share’ (Sharing with History-Aware Route Recommendations), it finds routes beyond shortest paths and recommends a route that is close in length to the shortest path and offers higher chance of finding a compatible ride-order. 
To verify the algorithms, researchers tested it on real taxi datasets from New York and Singapore across a range of metrics. The results showed that routes recommended by the algorithm received up to 40 per cent reduction in orders without ride-sharing than the shortest path. Also, this reduces waiting time for customers by 20 per cent.
“We would like to see how our algorithm works on Indian conditions by collaborating with one of the taxi operators from India. We are also extending this work for the food delivery business,” added Bagchi.
The research team included Chak Fai Yuen, Abhishek Pratap Singh, Sagar Goyal and Sayan Ranu. (India Science Wire)

Ever since it introduced its first bipedal robot, Cassie, in early 2017, Agility Robotics has said package delivery is an ideal application. We now have our first look at how the Albany, Oregon-based company envisions its bipedal robots assisting last-mile delivery.
Agility and Ford Motor Company are developing a last-mile delivery solution that combines Ford’s autonomous vehicles and Agility’s Digit bipedal robot. This system is in the early stages of development, but an autonomous delivery test program is scheduled to begin in early 2020.
Agility CEO Damion Shelton told The Robot Report the first time the entire system was up and running was just two weeks ago. The companies started discussing a partnership in February 2018 and began work on this project about six months ago.
“This is a big deal for [Ford] to be making this type of move,” said Shelton. “And for us it’s a big deal to be making firm decisions about what we’re using the robots for.”
Here’s how it works. Digit, which can fold up tightly, rides in the back of Ford’s autonomous vehicles. Using a patent-pending lift designed by Agility, Digit can get itself in and out of the vehicle. The lift mechanism latches onto the same place you would have third row seats and goes under Digit’s “armpits” to lift the robot in and out of the vehicle.

Digit, which can carry boxes up to 40 lb. (18 kg), picks up the package, walks up the front steps, drops off the package and returns to the autonomous vehicle.
One of the first questions with these types of videos is the level of autonomy involved. For this demo, local tele-operation was used to trigger behaviors for Digit at appropriate times — such as when to pick up the box and when to climb the stairs. But the actual picking up of the box and climbing of the stairs were performed autonomously and run locally on Digit.
The only thing “fake” part of the video are the dotted lines that indicate an obstacle in Digit’s path. Shelton said Digit did not fall once during the 12 hours of shooting the video.
“I’m as surprised as anyone because there was a bug in the system leading up to the shoot that caused Digit to fall excitedly and repeatedly. We didn’t know it was fixed until the day of the shoot.”
“We will repeat the same demo under 100 percent full autonomy,” Shelton said. “We’ll press a button and the full demo executes with no human involvement whatsoever. We’ll be able to go to any neighborhood, acquire a base map of the neighborhood, and then deploy the car and robot without someone giving it hints. We anticipate doing that by the end of this year or early next year.”
Shelton said upgraded versions of Digit being developed will help enable full autonomy. The second-generation Digit is coming in mid-2019 and the third generation in the fall. “The sensors on the robot in the video – LiDAR and Intel RealSense – are functional but aren’t used for planning. We’ve been testing version two of Digit with this sensor stack and plan to use it for full autonomy.”
Shelton said it’s more important to start capturing real-world data rather than adhere to the notion that it’s full autonomy or bust.

Help from the cloud
One interesting tidbit is how Ford’s autonomous vehicles could help Digit navigate edge cases or more difficult environments.
“A self-driving vehicle is capable of creating a detailed map of the surrounding environment, so why not share that data with Digit instead of having it recreate the same type of information?” said Dr. Ken Washington, Vice President, Ford Research and Advanced Engineering, and Chief Technology Officer. “After all, both Digit and the self-driving car need to know where they are in the world, where they need to go and how to get there. When a self-driving vehicle brings Digit to its final destination, the vehicle can wirelessly deliver all the information it needs, including the best pathway to the front door.
“The car could even send that information into the cloud and request help from other systems to enable Digit to navigate, providing multiple levels of assistance that help keep the robot light and nimble. Digit’s light weight also helps ensure it has a long run time, which is essential for a self-driving delivery business that will be operating most of the day.”
There haven’t been many instances, but this isn’t the first time a self-driving vehicle and legged robot worked together for last-mile delivery. ANYbotics’ quadruped robot, for example, was used by Continental to demo last-mile delivery at CES 2019.
What’s next for Digit the delivery robot?
Shelton said once Digit is capable of full autonomy for this application, testing will be done in Albany, Oregon and Michigan, which is home to Ford and a challenging weather environment.
“We’re very careful to say we don’t need to solve or address the hardest 90 percent of delivery problems. The easiest deliveries can be done with wheeled vehicles. But others can’t be done with wheeled vehicles, like the delivery in the video,” Shelton said. “All of those are test environments we can test in. We’re challenging ourselves just to the edge of what we can do all the time.”
Ford believes driverless delivery has huge potential. It said the potential value of the market for robot ride-hailing and driverless delivery is $332 billion.
“Logistics is a large market. If we gain 1 percent of the market each year, that’s an unbelievable growth rate for a robotics company,” said Shelton.
Shelton was clear this is not a commercial service competing with the UPS’ and FedEx’s of the world. And that the Agility-Ford partnership will remain in medium to large-scale pilot mode for a while.
“This is not a one-and-done concept for us,” Shelton said. “This is very much what we thought we’d be using Digit for. It’s earlier than we thought, but the opportunity was there now to partner with Ford. So we’re excited.”

If Tony Seba were a company, its slogan might be: The future is coming … faster than you think.
Seba, a Stanford- and MIT-educated entrepreneur, educator, researcher and author, is both lauded and criticized for his bullish predictions on the pace and impact of technology disruption, most notably in energy and transportation.
It’s one thing to say, as Seba does, that the 2020s will be “the most disrupted decade in history.” But it’s another entirely to forecast that electric vehicles will be cheaper than internal combustion vehicles as early as next year — or to declare that by 2025 every new car made will be electric.
Yet that’s the future which Seba’s research, based on a proprietary “disruption framework” analyzing cost curves and technology convergence, points to. And it’s not just cars: “Every new tractor, every new bus, every new truck will be electric, too,” he says.
Along with that change, the model of individual vehicle ownership will dramatically shift to transportation as a service, and be fully realized by 2030, says Seba. That’s a future in which the bulk of driving is done by fleets of electric, automated vehicles; where far fewer people own their own cars; and where cities start to be redesigned to take advantage of all the newly available space no longer needed for parking lots.
Electric Autonomy Canada is delighted that Seba agreed to join us for an exclusive interview from his office in California to discuss his outlook and share his thoughts on what transportation as a service means for Canada.
Electric Autonomy Canada: Is there anything particular about Canada that might hold us back or propel us forward towards the transportation-as-a-service scenario that you envision for 2030?

Tony Seba

Tony Seba: This disruption is going to happen, whether Canada wants it or not. Essentially, it’s going to happen for purely economic reasons. When you have this convergence of on-demand, autonomous and electric transport as a service, the cost per mile of transportation is going to go down by 10 times, from about $1 to 10 cents. Every time we’ve had a 10x decrease in cost, we’ve had a disruption and very quick. So, Canada is going to have to do it. The only question is, will it be upfront and gain the upside, or will it be behind and essentially let others dominate?
Canada has become a leader in information technology, essentially artificial intelligence. And AI is key, of course, to self-driving vehicles, to autonomous vehicles, and is key to pretty much every industry. And Canada is now a hub for AI. So, Canada has an opportunity to be a leader in energy and transportation because it is a technology disruption and Canada has great talent and investors to do that.
On the other hand, Canada is an extraction energy powerhouse. The Canadian government just bought a pipeline. And it owns or protects nukes, power companies and so on. And that could hold Canada back, because essentially the government is going to protect its legacy industries to the detriment of Canadian people.


This disruption is going to happen for purely economic reasons. The cost per mile of transportation is going to go down by 10 times, from about $1 to 10 cents
Tony Seba

Electric Autonomy: You’re very explicit in saying that the economics are driving these changes, that governments shouldn’t subsidize energy technologies. Yet you’re also saying there still is an important role for government to play, in having the right policies. Is that correct?
Tony Seba: Absolutely. Policy is really, really important. The government should set standards, set the right policies. The government also has the power of signalling — by saying we want to be a world leader in clean energy and clean transportation by 2030, that’s signalling. It can enable the right policies for this to happen. But it should allow entrepreneurs and the market to work because that’s where energy is right now.
Electric Autonomy: Here, we’ve got vastly different views on energy and transportation policies between different governments and the federal parties. The differences in direction and potential outcomes seem huge.
Tony Seba: What we have seen in the U.S. is that the states are leading, not the federal government. Look at California. It’s no coincidence that Tesla is here, that autonomous companies from all over the world are here. That’s because the state of California has policies that have enabled electrification, solar, batteries, autonomous technology and so forth. If we can extrapolate from that to Canada, the leadership should come from the provinces.
Electric Autonomy: In Ontario, and Alberta, we have two premiers who are tied to the legacy industries and characterize electric vehicles as symbols of leftism. What advice would you give to municipalities and business leaders in these provinces who are looking to be progressive on this front?
Tony Seba: Part of the mistake that a lot of folks make is to see this purely as environmental topic. This disruption is going to happen for purely economic reasons. When I did the numbers for the U.S., our conclusion was that by going to transport-as-a-service world, because it’s going to be that much cheaper on a per-mile basis, and because it’s going to free us from the cost of owning a car and insurance and gas, the average American family is going to get $6,000 back. That’s a trillion-dollar boost to the economy. On top of that, by not driving to work or to shop, there is another trillion dollars in productivity gains for the economy. So, we’re going to get new jobs and get money back.


The fallacy is that this disruption is going to be government-led, that we’re going to have to make sacrifices, that it’s going to cost us a lot of money. I think that once leaders and policy makers understand that, it’s a no-brainer.
Tony Seba

So, what can they do to enable this that it’s not going to cost us money? One, give every consumer and every business the right to generate, store and sell electricity. Right now, I don’t have to ask permission to publish a blog or sell my computer on eBay, why should I need permission to generate and sell electricity?
Another thing. Once we have Level 4 autonomous technology approved and ready — 2021 or 2022 — that day, essentially, the cost of transport is going to go down by 10x. That’s going to unleash all kinds of innovations and an upside for society in terms of access to work for people who don’t have access to public transportation, for the disabled, for the poor. The social upside for all those demographics is huge.
The government doesn’t need to subsidize EVs for it to happen, it just needs to have the right policies.






The accelerated transition from horses to cars took only 10 years, despite building two industries (oil and auto) and road infrastructure, while fighting WWI @tonyseba speaking at #FutureofPower







Electric Autonomy: Disruption in media has been driven by platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Whatever their benefits, they’ve also decimated local media and raised concerns about the quality of information, privacy, data rights. Is there a similar concern in conceding control of local transportation in Canada to global ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft?
Tony Seba: That’s a great question. Governments are hierarchical, they’re used to making decisions in industries like publishing and telecom and energy that are monopolies or centralized. By and large, they don’t know networks well enough to regulate them. That’s why companies like Facebook got out of hand. It’s a network, and governments by and large don’t know to manage or regulate networks.


So, one thing that we have to start doing — the people in governments that represent us — is to think about how to manage networks from a regulatory perspective, in the best interest of the people, not in the best interest of the networks.
Tony Seba

Today’s ride-hailing model is actually a double-sided network. Drivers on one side and users on the other side. Once you have that double-sided network, the barriers to entry are huge. So how do you get out of that? Well, when you enable autonomous technology, you disable the drivers’ side of the network. What that does is lower the barriers of entry to any company. When you have that, when you essentially have a network of users in transport as a service, anybody — a Ford, a GM, a Google, anybody — can come in with 10,000 or 20,000 cars — autonomous, electric, on-demand — and basically get into that market. So, one way to get us away from the power of the network is enabling autonomous technology.
Electric Autonomy: What about data privacy?
Tony Seba: Data privacy is very, very important. Whose data is it in the self-driving cars? Mapping right now is very important for autonomous technology. Who owns that mapping data? I, as a consumer, I am generating mapping data…who owns that data? Governments should at least make sure that a lot of that data is open, for instance. That data, in the beginning, should be consumer data. And also, some of it should be open, because it’s going to be in the best interest of society. High-definition mapping is digital streets. Today society owns the street. If we go into a mapping world where it’s all private, then basically every street becomes a toll road, to drive on any street you’re going to have to pay somebody who owns the high-definition mapping and we don’t want to go there.
Electric Autonomy: Are you optimistic that we can manage that new way of thinking?
Tony Seba: It will get easier as we move forward to 2030. We’re on the cusp of a lot of great things happening for society. On the other hand, because essentially every industry’s going to be disrupted, the danger is that we don’t take care of the downside. There’s going to be a lot of job losses, then the job gains will come later. Governments should be thinking about how do we protect our workers, to provide them health, a financial cushion and education to make the transition to the new growth industries? If we do that we’re going to be a lot more successful as a society and take advantage of the upside without having to go back to protecting obsolete industries.
WANT MORE ON THE THEMES RAISED BY TONY SEBA?
In future, we’ll be asking Canadian leaders for their reaction and views on these same topics.
Electric Autonomy: Do you have a sense of where the new jobs will be? And when will they come on?
Tony Seba: A lot of the new jobs, we don’t know where they are going to be, because new industries are going to create new opportunities that we can’t even envision. But we do know that the whole battery industry goes through the roof. Basically, this is a huge growth market. Countries should be investing in battery R&D and battery infrastructure and capacity rather than buying pipelines and nuclear power plants. Batteries, big growth. EVs, big growth. Wind. Solar. Autonomous technologies. All of these are big growth areas that are going to generate huge work over the next decade, if not two.
That’s one area. Another is construction. Individuals park their car for 96% of time. When you have transport as a service, individuals are not going to own cars because it doesn’t make any sense, it’s going to be fleets that drive around and don’t need to park. Essentially, a third or so of the land mass of cities is going to open up to people, to businesses, to green parks and that is going to generate a massive construction boom. Affordable housing, check; new business, check; new green spaces, check.
Electric Autonomy: Last question. You are often challenged for your ambitious forecasts. But in March, BloombergNEF updated its annual projection on the declining cost of EVs. It now foresees EVs becoming cheaper than internal combustion vehicles in 2022. Two years ago, it said 2026. With a year to go until 2020, they’ve nearly matched your forecast. Any comment?
Tony Seba: First, they ignore you, then they attack you, then you win. That’s how mainstream analysis and insiders work. The tipping point is happening as we predicted, the analysts are missing a lot of pieces for this equation. In particular, what the mainstream analysts are missing is fleets. They still see EVs as a one-to-one substitution for privately owned automobiles. The disruption will be when fleets start becoming electrified, automated and more widespread.

CAR SHARE MARKET IN CANADA
 
As of January, 2018, Canada had 20 car sharing services in operation with more than 336,000 members and 5,200 vehicles. In 2017, there were 3,300 car-sharing vehicles operating in the city of Vancouver alone, dubbed the ‘car-sharing capital of North America.’ A recent Vancity survey has revealed that 95% of ‘Vancouverites’ choose car-sharing services for the convenience, 62% to save money and 58% due to the concern for the environment.  
The are two types of car-sharing, one-way and two-way. An example of one-way sharing is car2go. You take the car from A to B and can drop it off anywhere in the service area. With a two-way car, you book by the hour and you pick it up and drop it off in the same place. The Canadian carshare market is also made up of many players, including small, local, non-profit co-operatives such as Kootenay Carshare. However the top Canadian carshare giants are:
CAR2GO
car2go launched in Ulm, Germany in 2008 before making its North American debut in Austin, Texas in 2010 and offers one-way carsharing. In Canada, it is available in Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal, as well as 30 other cities worldwide. Included in membership is fuel, insurance and free parking at all permit and residential areas. The car2go fleet contains electric vehicles, but only in Europe and Montreal.
If you are a Canadian member, you can also use the car2go’s carshare services anywhere in North America. However, in May 2018, car2go shut down its services in Toronto. Local Toronto residents complained when the company suggested its users park in any legal space, including those in residential areas. The Toronto city council passed a pilot that was heavily restrictive on carshare operators which included $1,500 parking permit fees per vehicle. The company said that these new rules would mean almost 10,000 parking would be off-limits for its customers, rendering the company inoperable, which is why they suspended their services.
ENTERPRISE CARSHARE
Originally Autoshare, it began in Toronto in 1998 before Enterprise Rent-a-Car bought the company in 2014. Enterprise carshare offers two-way car-sharing and is available in Regina, Sackville, New Brunswick, Saskatoon and Toronto as well as 35 American states. Fuel and insurance is included.
ZIPCAR


Zipcar was launched in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2000 and offers two-way car sharing. Zipcar has 10,000 vehicles in more than 480 cities across the world. In Canada it is available in Victoria, Vancouver, London (Ontario), Kitchener/Waterlook (Ontario), Toronto and Ottawa. Zipcar members can choose from over 50 different makes and models ranging from luxury vehicles to large vans.


COMMUNAUTO
Communauto launched In 1994, in Quebec City is unique because it offers round-trip, free-floating carsharing. It is available in Montreal, Ottawa, Quebec City, Halifax and Gatineau and Sherbrook in Quebec. Unlike other carshare providers, members do not have to pay fees for one-way sharing. The rates are 38 cents per minute and $12 per hour instead. Insurance and fuel are included and Communauto has more than 1,880 vehicles on the roads, including electric vehicles such as the Nissan Leaf.
The company recently acquired Halifax car-sharing company, CarShare Atlantic in January 2019. CarShare Atlantic is known for its introduction of vehicles that are accessible by everyone into its fleet, which includes a fully automated vehicle for people with physical disabilities.
Communauto also entered the Toronto market under the new pilot regulations of the city with a free-floating service offer. During the first phase of the pilot in November 2018, Communauto FLEX will operate in the downtown core with 200 cars servicing 50 square kilometres.
MODO
Modo was North-America’s first car sharing co-operative and started as a thesis project in 1997. It offers two-way car-sharing and is available in Vancouver, Lower Mainland, B.C and Victoria. There is a monthly fee of $5, unless you are an owner – you can buy a $500 share. Being an owner puts your rates at $5/hour compared to the $8/hour. Insurance and fuel are provided to members. Vehicles included are Hatchbacks, convertibles, CUVs, trucks, hybrids, electric vehicles, minivans and cargo vans.
Modo has grown substantially since Evo and car2go entered the Vancouver market and currently has 700 vehicles in its fleet. The company continues to expand on its model and is highly innovative using the latest in-house technology. For example, a new feature that they offer is Open Return. Since the car share revolution began, there has only been one way to book a trip and that is with an end time in mind. Modo’s latest feature allows the user the luxury of booking the car for a full 24 hours but only paying for the length of time the car was in use and it only costs $3.
Modo is also partnering with Translink, Evo Car Share and Mobi bike share in a pilot to offer integrated travel to the residents of Metro Vancouver. When each method of transport in connected and effectively communicating with each other, it creates seamless, easier travels routes for its users.
EVO
Evo began in 2015 and was launched by BCAA. It offers one-way carsharing and is only available in Vancouver. A one-time $35 registration fee is required and the rates are 41 cents per minute, $14.99 per hour or $89.99 per day. Fuel, insurance, free parking all permit and residential only areas are included for their members.
We created a strategy for Evo, that focused on consistent customer service and fleet operations and implemented this strategy in Vancouver. We did this through an internal pilot project, creating a seamless infleeting chain, building an internal call center, hiring dedicated teams and producing a complete library of all fleet and customer service processes. Our goal was to ensure that Evo carshare offers the best carshare fleet and service in Vancouver. 
One main aim for introducing car sharing to Canadian citizens was to eliminate the high numbers of car ownership in the country. In a survey of carshare member however, 28% said they find it more convenient to carshare on occasion but still own a car, due to the strict geographical limitations of many services. However, 25% of those surveyed said they had no more need for a private vehicle and “threw away the key” and 12% said they simply couldn’t afford to buy a car.
RIDE HAILING MARKET IN CANADA
Ride-hailing, although available in many Canadian provinces is still a contentious subject, particularly in British Columbia. Currently, there are only 14 regions in Canada that have ride-sharing services available, a few of which include; Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal.
These cities make up around 50% of the country’s population. It’s still very much an urban service and overall, Canada’s ride-sharing service is quite small. At present ride hailing revenue in Canada amounts to US$829m, in comparison to China’s US$35,589m. However, this figure is expected to grow by 2023, with ride-hailing revenue forecasted at US$1,067m.
However, after years of waiting, British Columbians may also be able to catch a ride in an Uber or Lyft – but not quite yet. The B.C. government has introduced legislation to allow ride-hailing in the province by sometime in 2019. The proposed changes include amendments to eight provincial statutes. For example, drivers for ride-hail services will need to have Class 4 licences. This means they’ll have to have criminal record and medical fitness checks every five years.
Similar to British Columbia, Saskatchewan has also passed legislation to allow ride-hailing vehicles in the province. The Vehicles for Hire Act allows ride-sharing companies to operate in Saskatchewan, but gives municipalities responsibility for issuing licences, deciding how licences are allocated, who can drive a ride-share vehicle, setting standards for the vehicles themselves, and setting fees, rates or fares. In February Saskatoon was the first city to introduce Uber to the streets of Saskatchewan.
Some of the bigger ride-hail services currently operating in Canada are, Uber, Facedrive – a Canadian startup aims to pay its drivers better than Uber and offer them the opportunity to be a part of a cooperative business structure, European car sharing company Taxify and Lyft, only available in Toronto, but Uber’s biggest competition.
Ridehailing also has the power in supporting smaller towns transport needs such as Innisfil, Ontario. The town is moving away from more common methods of public transportation such as buses and is opting in for ridehailing services instead. The town is partnering with Uber and subsidizing the cost of rides for its users, offering flat rates on Uber Pool. It is an experimental partnership, but one that is estimated to save $8 million per year.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTION IN CANADA

Canada is behind the majority of other developed-world peers when it comes to adopting EV technology. Canadian consumers in general are not opposed to EV adoption but with government policy and the local auto industry not keeping pace, with regards to public and private EV infrastructure, buying an electric car in Canada can be an expensive risk.
In a survey of 30 member countries by GoCompare, Canada was found to have 23,620 electric cars on the roads at the end of 2017. That’s a lower number than in many smaller countries, including Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Canada also placed seventh with regards to EV infrastructure, with 0.56 stations per 100 kilometres of road. In comparison, the Netherlands has 23.25 charging stations per 100 km of road and is number one in the world.
However, these results came from studies and surveys conducted in 2017. According to Fleetcarma, in the first nine months of 2018, electric vehicle sales in Canada (hybrids included) were up by 158% compared to the same period in 2017. Incentives such as rebates for plug-in vehicles, incentives for charging stations at homes, stratas and workplaces are available to B.C. residents, businesses, non-profit organizations and local government organizations.
However, we do see electric vehicles being incorporated into car share fleets, such as Car2Go, Evo, Zipcar. Hopefully with a large scale introduction of EV infrastructure across Canadian cities, we will see a spike in fleets offering electric and hybrid vehicles.
CANADIAN MICROMOBILITY OFFERINGS 
There are many bike share providers operating across Canada. Vancouver, for example has Mobi by Shaw Go, which started in 2016 and has more than 1,400 bicycles and almost 150 solar-powered stations and 75,000 users.
Other areas of British Columbia also offer bike share services. In Greater Victoria, TapBike converts regular bicycles to smart bikes using a Bluetooth locking system and Kelowna started an 18-month dockless bike-share pilot with Dropbike in the spring.
American company, LimeBike launched the first ever e-bike share network in Calgary, which is a success whenever the weather co-operates. Lime released 375 electric pedal, dockless bikes into the streets of the city. The company sends out crews to pick up bikes and charge them so they do not have to be returned to charging stations.
E-SCOOTER SHARING
Last October, Waterloo city council voted to yes to the implementation of a new micro-mobility solution. The pilot project is also being hosted by Lime. The city was targeted because of its strong tech community and will be bringing e-scooters to its residents in the not-too-distant future.
It’s not just Waterloo that is hoping to implement the current trend in mobility – electric scooters and electric bikes could be on Edmonton roads as early as this summer. If successful, these pilot schemes could pave the way to the introduction of micromobility across the Canadian shared mobility landscape.
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IN CANADA
Last year alone there were more than 37,000 road fatalities in the US and 1,800 in Canada. Over 90% of crashes were caused by human error. The introduction of AVs is a way of significantly reducing these numbers.
Ottawa is the not only the capital city of Canada, but the Autonomous Vehicle capital of Canada as well. There are more that 70 companies and organizations creating AV clusters in key technology centres across the city. Each company contributes expertise and technology in areas like software, cybersecurity, IoT to AVs and much more. Anchored by global AV leader BlackBerry QNX, more than 45 of the firms that comprise Ottawa’s AV cluster are located in Kanata North Technology Park, the largest of its kind in Canada. This was also the location of Canada’s first ‘on-road’ autonomous vehicle testing.
However, the Canadian Senate Committee on Transport and Communications report for 2018, found Canada “ill-equipped for the fast-growing future of transportation” and called on the federal government to develop a national strategy. In an effort to combat the lack of infrastructure, cities such as Vancouver and Surrey submitted a $50 million joint application to the Federal Infrastructure Canada Smart Cities Challenge.
ELECTRONIC AUTOMATION
As part of the Smart Cities bid, the City of Vancouver and Surrey have teamed up and welcomed an ELA (Electronic Automation) shuttle, so that local residents can experience riding in a driverless vehicle. The EZ10 Driverless Shuttle – is already being used in several countries around the world. The shuttle is a fully-accessible, 100% electric vehicle with a battery life of up to 14 hours. It holds up to 12 passengers and will travel at about 12 km/h during the demo but has a maximum travelling speed of 40 km/h.
If the cities of Vancouver and Surrey are chosen as the winning submission for the Smart Cities Challenge, they will be able to “demonstrate the path to safer, healthier and more connected communities while reducing emissions, improving transportation efficiency, and enhancing livability in the face of rapid growth and traffic congestion.”

In 2015, the Government of India launched ‘Smart Cities Mission’ as an urban renewal and retrofitting program, with a vision to develop 100 smart cities across India, to spur economic growth and improve the quality of governance and public life.
 In a country of billions, intimately familiar with the challenges of travelling in crowded cities and a vast yet diverse geography, the concept of smart cities with fast mobility can sometimes seem unrealistic. But nothing can be further from the truth. With smart planning and deployment of intelligent technological solutions such as electric mobility, Cloud-based digital controls, advanced AI tools, we can turn this formidable vision into reality.
Data, Location and Location Intelligence
Every city usually has access to large amounts of valuable operational data whether it is related to urban planning, public safety, healthcare services, traffic controls, etc. When we consider the current technological developments, the maxim- ‘data is the new oil’ stands true. It intersects across various components of planning and management.







Moreover, since so much of planning and management is ‘location-centric’, accessing and understanding location related data is and can drive easy and intelligent mobility- one of the foundations on which a smart city is built. For e.g.- In Danang, Vietnam, smart cameras and sensors have been deployed to monitor traffic, manage road safety and inform future city planning.  Closer home, Pune in India is an example of how mobile network data can be used to gather information on public habits and infrastructure usage.
 Let’s look at how Location Intelligence, when incorporated into business intelligence across verticals, can help shape the future of intelligent mobility in India:
Shared mobility
Over the last few years, owing to rapid urbanization, traffic congestion, distressing parking fees and a surge in new-app based mobility solutions, we have been witnessing a shift in car-ownership to greater use of shared transportation.
Experts argue that buyers, especially younger ones, don’t necessarily want to be bogged down with owning a vehicle. If industry estimates are anything to go by, India is predicted to be the leader in shared mobility by 2030. For businesses providing private mobility and shared cab services, this presents a huge opportunity to deliver more personalized and on-demand customer services using maps, embedded connectivity, location data on road conditions, weather fluctuations, visual routes, reduced travel time, etc. Companies could also identify major gaps in their existing infrastructure in specific locations and introduce value added ‘on-demand’ services such as food delivery or courier.
Public Transport
The coming years will see Location Intelligence change the face of public transportation systems. At present, the urban satellite town of Maharashtra; Navi Mumbai, has deployed real time data driven Integrated Intelligent Transport System (IITS) that has eased bus travel woes. This includes a mobile app that informs travelers of the nearest bus stations and helps them track fastest routes.
On the other hand, it helps authorities to track buses that skip stops and act. In such a situation, Location Intelligence could have wider applications for the public transport sector. It can help visualize the movement of people, when a road is closed for maintenance, while at the same time offer predictive models that can be used to show what will happen the next time, the road closes.
AI based predictive maps could help drivers to reduce journey time or calculate the optimal traffic signal timing. Leveraging rich GPS analytics and high-definition maps could provide insights to plan better pedestrian walkways and provide alternative travel modes such as ‘stairs’ or ‘elevators.’
Logistics & Fleet management
Logistics sector is important for a country’s GDP as it facilitates movement of goods and services from one geography to another. Given that logistics optimization is always a complex equation, Location Intelligence and spatial data can be leveraged to build predictive data models that can provide insights on road restraints, define alternative distribution routes and warehouse capacity limits, thus reducing fuel cost and time to last mile delivery.
Organizations can also use sensors and fleet management applications to monitor and coach driver on driving behaviors and compliance with road safety regulations, thus minimizing any human or goods damage.
Healthcare & citizen services
A few years back, Jill Hubley, a web-developer created a detailed interactive atlas, mapping all the species of trees present in New York. What emerged from her work is a kaleidoscope of colors and fascinating look at the city’s biodiversity that is now used to plan and maintain the city’s green cover.
This indicates how location mapping and intelligence platforms can enable governments and civic bodies to plan better delivery of public welfare and healthcare services. Using city data and real-time mobility streams, civic bodies could also be alerted about accidents live, allowing emergency services team to respond faster, and thus improving governance and public life on roads.

This is an excerpt of a blog published by Matthew W. Daus, Esq., in Black Car News. The full blog can be viewed here.

In the future, it is likely that we will see more cross-pollination between car rentals on the back end of mobility services. A for-hire or TNC (Transportation Network Company) driver who owns their own vehicle may wish to drive for-hire one day, rent the vehicle to another TNC driver who does not own a car the next day, and the next week rent the car to a passenger to use for a vacation or business trip.
The sharing of vehicles on a platform serves as a potential method to reduce the costs of ownership, allow for flexible working environments, and to hopefully, over time, reduce the costs of transportation to passengers. Ultimately, these platforms in the short term will involve more merging of services between car rental companies and individuals on the back-end for supply purposes; on the demand side, passengers or renters will be able to open either a car sharing, TNC, or other platform app to choose between a quick ride with an assigned driver, or the app user can rent a car for an extended period of time without an assigned driver.
These on-demand options and business models are rapidly evolving and are already happening on some levels.
It is inevitable that public transit agencies may even get in on the action for first and last mile and other Mobility-As-A-Service options. For example, a commuter who takes the train can rent a car located in a parking lot at the train station when coming home on a Friday night and then return it Monday morning while on the way to work.
The provision of on-demand booking, numerous mobility options, and convenience are inevitable. The implementation of a public and private platform where passengers or renters can load credit card information to pay for public transit and private rentals interchangeably presents liability or duty of care, data management, and other complications or sticky legal issues when involving governmental services and operations.
A more likely way these services can be implemented in tandem with public transit would be franchises or concessions at or around municipal parking and transit curb space locations, with the outsourcing of app functionality and services to one or more private companies that can interface directly with the public.
Safety, Liability, and Insurance
It is refreshing to see that the carsharing industry is not engaging in illegal disruption as the TNCs did in their nascent rise by issuing ultimatums to regulators and simply ignoring laws and rules to commence operations, and then changing the laws after the fact. The TNC laws that were passed over the years came after — not before — the introduction of TNC services.
Here, with the exception of New York State as an early warning to the industry, it appears that laws are being crafted, like in Maryland, to accommodate and encourage carsharing while addressing the liability, insurance, and other safety/regulatory/consumer issues — before the fact, not after. This will allow investors and consumers to feel more confident and will allow the industry to scale better and faster if the example of Maryland is followed elsewhere.
The insurance industry and insurance regulators must keep-up with these new sharing models and find a way to make them work while protecting the public interest. Success or failure of the carsharing industry — across all the business models — rests with regulators and private insurance companies embracing the changes and figuring out ways to reduce risk and costs to consumers and insureds. Some of the new laws are encouraging, but more needs to be done, including flexible ratemaking and filings for flexible carsharing models.
Any inertia or resistance will stifle innovation in this sector. Likewise, tax laws should be conformed to create an even playing field and uniformity, possibly eliminating such taxes for everyone to encourage the use of shared mobility services.
Experiment Now
It is all so very important that the cross-pollination of carsharing and vehicle rental with for-hire and other mobility services happens now, with as much experimentation as possible with public and private mobility platforms on both the front-end (demand/consumer facing) and on the back-end (supply/driver and car rental company inventory sharing).
The results of these experiments are likely to guide both public and private decision making on autonomous and connected vehicle implementation. The sharing of vehicles is an important part of our mobility future, especially as consumers expect the price or costs of transportation to stay low or reasonable. The partnerships between automakers and carsharing, car rental, and mobility companies could be motivated by any number of reasons, such as innocent experimentation, joint ventures and brand merger.
There could also be more nefarious motives — such as spying on the competition or possibly even buying companies to put them out of business so that automakers can continue to sell cars to the masses without sharing.
All possibilities are on the table right now, but the partnerships and experiments of today will be the future of autonomous mobility, where automakers or technology or mobility companies could turn technology platforms and apps into the deployment and sharing of automated vehicles owned by the government, private individuals, or companies, with any combination of ownership and sharing options.
It is truly mind boggling to think of where this could go. For now, everyone in neighboring spaces should be aware of these issues and trends because if overlapping companies in the ecosystem are not aware of where they are or should be in the ever-evolving food chain, certain transportation species or companies could find themselves facing extinction.

With extreme disruption comes the need for foresight and informed decision-making. For marketers there are few things more informative than converging trends. Earlier in this series I canvassed the extreme disruption being faced by the global automotive industry and how it is occurring on a number of levels. Any one of these disruptive forces – electrification of vehicles or connected cars at the product level, or digitisation, urbanisation and environmentalism at the macro level – would signal a need for marketers to reassess their strategy. When the forces are converging and influencing one another, however, strategic realignment becomes vital.
Convergence also offers clues as to the sequence and speed of change and adoption, and illuminates what is required from a marketing perspective. For example, the development of the connected car is likely, in turn, to drive the development and use of shared and autonomous cars – the connectivity will be a crucial element of the sharing platform in the first case and the safety and viability of autonomous operation in the second. It is also clear, for example, that the desire for mobility options in a world of increasing congestion, coupled with connectivity and shared vehicle options, will propel new transportation systems. In the simplest of terms, the multiple and overlapping trends mean dramatic change is inevitable. Like all change, while it will be erratic, there will also be patterns and sequences.
Another crucial clue to the future of the automotive industry is the flow of money. In Australia, automotive businesses should monitor where global players are investing, then reorient themselves accordingly. While there are many unknowns, there are plenty of factors at play that offer considerable insight for marketing decisions in Australia:

the nature of the change both at a macro-environment and industry level
the converging trends, and
the scale and focus of current investments both by international automotive manufacturers and new players.

New technology, global competition, high costs of local labour and changing consumer behaviours are all affecting the profitability of established operations, but there are opportunities for companies that are ready to adapt. The research that I am conducting with the financial support of incentive group Destination has identified a number of strategic marketing implications of the anticipated market disruption. They fall into the following areas:

Understanding the consumer
consideration of strategic sequences
consumers’ view of brands, and
specific implications at the automotive dealer level.

Understanding the customer
Automotive businesses will need to spend a lot more time analysing consumers and value propositions, rather than simply serving up the latest product ‘improvements’. This will range across all aspects of the car offering including performance, comfort, safety, design, entertainment and interactivity, reliability, aesthetics, autonomous and self-driven, electric or petrol/diesel, outright ownership or another form of purchase. Companies will need to understand mobility from a user-centric perspective, which may mean that features previously valued by buyers or pushed by car companies become less appealing.
New offerings will be competing for consumer validation. The connected car offers a wealth of opportunity to enhance both driver and passenger experience while also providing practical solutions to everyday problems. In the automotive industry it is known that Australian consumers are early adopters (shown, for example, by their enthusiastic take-up of SUVs), so manufacturers and other players including dealers that understand their customers will be best placed to develop offerings that hold market appeal.
Many consumers will prefer not to own their own car, or at least a second family car, and will see subscription as attractive. We know that about 30% of car users (a figure constant since 2017) are questioning ongoing car ownership. Nevertheless, while subscription offerings may become increasingly popular, car manufacturers can be expected to continue to offer private ownership options, as many consumers will still see significant practical, personal and psychological benefits of traditional car ownership. Rates of private ownership will vary by customer age, income, attitude, use etc.
Overall, CASE (connected, autonomous, shared and electric vehicles) technologies suggest a whole host of positive and transformative changes that will only add great value to private ownership and to the types of cars we currently buy, whether family, sports, SUV, or luxury cars. There will also be mobility experiences of an entirely new kind.
The evolving market
Understanding how the market will evolve is of great strategic importance and involves analysing a host of factors such as understanding current industry investments, government actions, buying patterns, infrastructure issues, various other tipping points, and how one development in CASE may trigger another. 
Market adoption of autonomous fleets (robo-taxis), for example, will be an indicator of how quickly regular drivers may adopt self-driving cars. Fleet operators are looking at developing a centralised system controller (similar to air traffic controllers in the air travel industry) who would oversee as many as 50 cars. This sort of innovation would reduce costs and thus enable mainstream consumer diffusion.
Similarly, the way consumers value technology and safety improvements led by the connected car will have an important flow-on effect on future product development, and inevitably also have implications for the success of autonomous vehicles. The way the connected car changes buyer perceptions of the vehicle as an experience will also be a major indicator of future value positions and customer experiences.
There are many elements that are difficult to assess such in relation to the use of big data. The connected car will harvest a significant level of data which will provide diverse insights about what additional services customers can be exposed to. However, we can expect disputes over who owns this data (manufacturer, service, parts, finance, dealer), as well as concerns over data privacy. An advantage for car companies is the significant trust consumers have in them.
Car users are more likely to trust car companies rather than others in a connected ecosystem (such as insurance agencies and energy providers) which means manufacturers are in a position to form stronger relationships and move quickly to present new products and services for the connected car owner.
The importance of brand
Extreme disruption will redefine how consumers see value in a car and therefore will have profound implications on how manufacturers present their brands. My research suggests major companies are likely to revert to existing strengths in their brands to attract customers, including the heritage they have in these brands.
Volvo, for example, is likely to leverage its strong track record on safety and market this aspect in its engagement with consumers. Safety is likely to be a key focus of consumers who are looking to adopt technology-advanced and autonomous cars.
BMW, on the other hand, is known for performance and so may well recode how it represents the performance-related attributes and meanings of its evolving products.
As the inventor of the car, Daimler and Mercedes-Benz have a particular claim to the hallmark of quality and know-how, and could be expected to emphasise a superior understanding of the new automotive world. A type of ‘we knew then, and we know now’ approach may be used to persuade consumers to trust the German manufacturer. Whatever the approach, the power of the brand will be at the fore.
Brands and branding will be especially important – and competitive – for new players in the industry such as Dyson and Tesla. They face an enormous challenge because of the size and widespread consumer acceptance of incumbent players – moreover they cannot match the economies of scale enjoyed by existing operators in the industry. New players’ ability to integrate through partnerships and alliances will be important.
A related curious challenge is the willingness of incumbents to work together despite a history of competitiveness. The tie-up between BMW and Mercedes around shared and subscription offerings will, if successful, have massive implications for the mobility industry and make it more difficult for new players to steal market share.
Lastly, many suggest with the coming of electric, shared and autonomous cars that the vehicle will become a commodity as people will merely want to get from one place to the next. While this may be the case to some degree, brands will still matter greatly and with CASE vehicles will come very powerful evolving brand identities supported with differentiated offerings. In fact, brands and brand building will likely take on an even more important role in the disrupted automotive industry than we are accustomed to at present.
The dealer landscape
Extreme disruption and the changing market suggest that the physical presence and structure of the dealership environment will need to evolve especially as the CASE innovations and digitisation become more mainstream.
Dealership spaces will need to be more flexible and adaptable as the product will be changing at a faster rate than ever and across more levels than simply product design. Traditionally structured dealership environments, with large numbers of cars on the lot, will need to adjust given the constant pipeline of new products and mobility related services. Dealers, more than anyone, will need to embrace change and see it as an opportunity.
There are a number of possible dealer environments, and their suitability will depend on the nature of the dealer business model. This includes a strategic understanding of its link into the ecosystem/s, their target market and capacity to differentiate, and its sources of revenue now and in the future. Some possibilities are:

Existing model, showroom, many cars on the lot. Consolidation may mean this continues, but is much less likely to be the dominant approach as the mix of product and service mobility options evolves and competition increases.
Retail shop, two or three cars, digital interface (ordering). In the shopping mall, potential to position brand according to nearby outlets. Mercedes-Benz, for example, may seek to be positioned near premium fashion designers.
Lifestyle dealership precinct and mobility hubs. Dealers are located in lifestyle centres offering a mix of mobility products and services, and are situated among complementary brands, products and services such as high-end fashion, homewares, fine foods and health centres. An early example of this is the Mercedes-Benz Breakfast Creek Wharf Lifestyle Precinct in Brisbane.
Manufacturer direct. Some manufacturers like Volvo have entered the manufacturer direct sales channel. Given the increased role of digital platforms, savvy digital buyers, high product quality and reliability even in non-premium vehicles, it is probable that this channel will continue to expand.
Hybrid. Fewer cars, digital, customisation and with added services like bundling of mobility options (ownership and subscription packages, for example), dealers may become a focal point for different mobility solutions.

Ultimately, dealers are likely to hold fewer cars because of the associated costs, while salespeople will increasingly require specialised technology knowledge beyond pure mobility aspects. Online retailers like Kogan who play an aggregator role searching hundreds of dealerships to find better deals and deliver direct to people’s homes (sometimes with significant savings) will expand.
Taking an aerial view of extreme disruption, one thing is clear: the converging trends and the sheer scale of investment and change within and across ecosystems means that dealers will increasingly need to position themselves not just as a retailer of cars but as a route to market for mobility solutions. This likely means they will need to sell a different combination of products and services than they do currently. They will need to form closer relationships both with manufacturers and corporate (including fleet) and private consumers with changing preferences and needs. This will include becoming part of new digital and hybrid sales channels, and thinking in very different ways about customer experience and how it can evolve.
Given the magnitude and protracted nature of change, there is a very real prospect that dealers who do not move with the market will find it difficult to compete. Investing for the future is a way of protecting what they have in the present.
Conclusion
Disruption of the automotive industry will occur at an unprecedented level in terms of the scale of investment, its longevity, and in the multiple areas of change. Most particularly, changes will occur in product, service and new and existent stakeholders. The industry is still at the investment phase of this evolution, with the extreme disruption still to come. While some aspects of disruption will be drawn out – for example mainstream use of the autonomous car – other aspects will happen quickly, such as the developing sophistication of the connected car and more integrated shared mobility options.
The convergence of a number of market trends, coupled with the scale and nature of investment, helps paint the picture of what the future may hold. Savvy market players will need to refine their strategies as the direction and pace of evolution becomes clearer. This is true not just for manufacturers and other product and service developers, but also for dealers who face particularly turbulent times.

Global Mobility on Demand Market is set to grow from its current market value of more than $100 billion to over $200 billion by 2024; according to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc.    
The development of travel & tourism industry is expected to be one of the major drivers of the industry. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council, in 2016, the direct contribution of this sector to GDP was USD 2,306.0 billion, that is approximately 3.1% of the total GDP. Transport forms a vital component of the travel industry for the sustainable growth of the sector. Using mobile technologies, travelers are seeking more freedom of movement, demanding advanced mobility solutions such as car rental services and positively impacting the mobility on demand market. Furthermore, several tourism & hospitality companies are offering services such as car rental and ride-hailing. For instance, Active African Vacations Ltd. has partnered with Self Drive Uganda to provide car rental services to the tourists.
Mobility on Demand Market
 

 
The smart cities initiatives by the governments of various countries including the U.S., Spain, Ireland, India, Singapore, and Sweden are expected to speed up the mobility on demand market expansion. The governments are providing incentives to the people to share rides while commuting and converting the existing public fleet of vehicles to electric vehicles. For instance, under the smart city project, the Vienna Model Region is developing e-mobility on demand to integrate the transportation system with the e-car sharing model effectively.
The legalization of ride-hailing services, such as Uber and Grab, by the government of Malaysia will drive the mobility on demand market growth in the region. The government of Malaysia has made amendments to the Commercial Vehicles Licensing Board (CVLB) Act and Land Public Transport Act to allow the ride-hailing operators to work as an intermediary. The intermediary business license will allow these operators to facilitate transactions and booking of these services.
Growing concerns regarding the privacy and security of the customer data are expected to challenge the mobility on demand market growth. The penetration of smartphones and increasing internet usage is encouraging the users to use applications that open loopholes for cyber threats.
The mobility on demand market in business applications is poised to grow at a significant pace as these services help the corporate organizations to reduce the dependency on private fleets. Also, these services allow the organizations to significantly reduce fleet-related costs and optimize the fleet management. Companies such as Omoove and Ubeeqo provide these services to the corporations that are tailored according to their specific requirements.

UK car rental market size, by application, 2017 & 2024 (USD Million)
The Germany mobility on demand market is expected to grow over the next six years due to the stringent regulations imposed on taxi drivers such as the obligation to operate taxi service and obligation to set rates. Increasing environmental consciousness and openness to innovations among the consumers are expected to drive industry growth. Several automobile companies in the country are entering the mobility on demand market to regain the declining positions due to the reduction in car ownership. For instance, BMW Group entered the industry by forming a subsidiary, DsriveNow, which is a car sharing company.
Some of the vendors in the mobility on demand market include Avis Budget Group, Hertz Corporation, Car2Go, Didi Chuxing, DriveNow GmbH & Co. KG, and Enterprise Rent-A-Car. The industry is characterized by the presence of several global & regional players and common strategies adopted by the players include mergers & acquisitions and partnerships. For instance, in March 2018, Daimler AG acquired the European car sharing platform, Car2Go by acquiring a major share from Europcar, a car rental company. In March 2017, Fox Rent-A-Car announced the acquisition of cloud-based P2P car sharing platform, JustShareIt.

It’s a chilly Thursday night in late January, and Detroiter Tamara Ballinger is waiting for a bus at DDOT’s Rosa Parks Transit Center. The 21-year-old college student and fast food worker is sitting on a bench listening intently to music on her smartphone, seemingly oblivious to the cold. But when asked about how she navigates between home, work, and school, her eyes light up a little.
“I take the bus home from work. And if I get off late, I take a Lyft or a cab,” she says. “I like Lyft, but the cab is a little too expensive. I wish they had 24-hour bus service [on my route].”
Not far away, Vincent Further-Bey, 54, a recent Texas transplant to Detroit, says he relies on the bus system to get to his distribution center job in Livonia. When the topic of electric scooters comes up, though, he’s eager to share his thoughts.
“A friend of mine comes down here [to the transit center] and takes a scooter to Grand River and Livernois,” he says. “I’ll be using them this summer to check out downtown.”
For Ballinger and Further-Bey and many other commuters, the streets of Detroit aren’t what they used to be. The city’s transportation landscape has shifted dramatically; new services like electric scooters and bike sharing have become part and parcel to how people get around in the Motor City these days.
Connected mobility
To bus riders, new transportation modes mean more choices. And they offer new solutions for covering the distance from work and homes to bus stops, what’s known as the first/last mile problem. But the emergence of this patchwork of options also raises questions about which services to use and how to navigate between them.
Detroit is rapidly transforming into a multimodal city where people rely on several different ways to get around. Megan Owens is executive director of Transportation Riders United (TRU), a nonprofit Metro Detroit transit advocacy group that held a public forum on new mobility services and technology last fall.
For the most part, says Owens, TRU feels “the more transportation options people have the better,” whether as an additional alternative or as a way to bridge the first/last mile problem. That said, Owens stresses the importance of not looking at the arrival of new transit modes as a cure-all for the region’s transportation needs.
“Our biggest concern is how do we make sure these are options are for everyone,” she says, “whether it’s the 92-year-old grandma who doesn’t have a smartphone, or people who don’t have bank accounts, or people in wheelchairs.”
Multimodal city, multimodal region
While taxis, buses, and the People Mover have been here for some time, over the last ten years there’s been a surge of new transportation alternatives.
DDOT started getting bike racks on buses around 2008, a move that has allowed bicyclists to integrate buses into their trips and, in turn, enjoy more flexibility in how they get around. Since that time, the city has built an impressive 240-mile network of bike lanes. The on-demand ride hailing service Uber, which relies on a smartphone app to connect drivers and riders came online here in 2013. Its competitor Lyft set up shop the following year. May 2017 saw the launch of MoGo, a dock-based public bike share system. And last year, three dockless electric scootercompanies — Bird, Lime and Spin — arrived in Detroit, as did May Mobility autonomous shuttles, self-driving electric vehicles that can carry up to six people along a predetermined loop.
In 2016, Detroit’s Mayor Mike Duggan established an Office of Mobility Innovation to coordinate new additions like these. And two years in, it’s borne some intriguing fruit.
Last summer, DDOT and MoGo partnered up on a limited-time offer to provide free 30-day bike share passes to bus riders who bought long-term bus passes. In May, the agency kicked off a pilot program with Lyft to help bus riders cover late gaps in bus coverage. DDOT passengers who text a certain phone number can get a $7 credit towards a Lyft ride during designated hours.
And in the fall, DDOT released an upgrade to its bus tracking and trip planning app, Transit, making it easier to seamlessly connect with Uber and Lyft. The app can also be used to access MoGo’s bike sharing services.
The Rosa Parks Transit Center is a hub in central Detroit.
“The City of Detroit Office of Mobility Innovation is doing a good job of trying to stay on top of these things,” says Owens. “Cities certainly have a challenge in that regard, when things like the new scooters just literally show up one day.”
Unlike Ann Arbor, which warned dockless scooter users to stay off the sidewalks and bike lanes and initially confiscated those parked improperly in the public right-of-way, Detroit has been more embracing of the new mobility technology. Late last year it raised the cap on Bird and Lime scooters from 300 to 400 each with the understanding more would be placed in neighborhoods outside downtown.
Creating space to move
Todd Scott is executive director of the Detroit Greenways Coalition. For a person whose organization played a considerable role in building up Detroit’s biking and walking infrastructure, he has an interesting take on how it relates to the scooters.
“I don’t know if it’s right to call it just bike infrastructure, because it accommodates bikes and scooters both very well,” he says. “And in some ways, I think the scooters are going to encourage the city to make more investments in bike lanes.”
Right now, Scott is in the thick of developing the Joe Louis Greenway, a 26-mile trail that will run a ring around the heart of Detroit. He’s excited about what it and MoGo’s upcoming expansion into more city neighborhoods and several Oakland County communities will mean for city and regional transit.
A new dedicated walking and biking path will facilitate faster, safer trips for cyclists with minimal motorized vehicle interactions as they commute through Detroit’s core city to get to work, school, and shopping locations. And the expansion of MoGo, in tandem with a new 17.1-mile bike route through many of the same communities, called the Woodward Corridor Neighborhood Bicycle Network, could play a role in normalizing bicycling as a mobility option throughout the region.
Metropolitan connectivity is also a topic of interest for the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG), which intends to include new mobility options in its next long-range regional transportation plan.
“Our policy recommendations include encouraging projects that integrate first- and last-mile connections to increase accessibility … [and] collaboration with new mobility providers such as bikeshare and e-scooters to collect and share data,” SEMCOG spokesperson Sue Stetler said in an email.
As a member of the of Southeast Michigan’s Regional Transit Authority Citizens’ Advisory Committee, Owens says that RTA is also actively looking into new mobility pilots and ways to integrate these new services. And that’s got her feeling good about the future of new mobility options in Metro Detroit.
“We need to make sure that people don’t go overboard and think we don’t need transit anymore,” she says. “But as long as they’re seen as an addition, I’m pretty optimistic about where things are headed.”

Carsharing Market







The carsharing market generated a revenue of $5,571.2 million in 2018 and is estimated to progress at a CAGR of 11.0% during the forecast period (2019–2025), owing to advancements in technology, which are helping make the access to shared mobility services easy. The growing demand for convenient and cost-effective mobility services, coupled with government policies encouraging the use of carsharing programs, is the key factor driving the growth of the market. In simple terms, carsharing is a short–term rental service offered to customers at a certain charge.
Favorable government regulations for carsharing services, growing concerns over environmental emissions, increasing demand for more convenient and cost-effective mobility solutions, and advancements in technology are the key factors driving the growth of the market.
Besides, the high upfront and maintenance costs associated with personal cars are encouraging people to switch to shared mobility services. Since owning a car demands a high investment in terms of vehicle cost, fuel cost, parking and maintenance charges, and insurance cost, people are increasingly adopting carsharing services that provide them the flexibility to rent a car, without having the need to own one. The users can make the payment on the basis of the time and distance travelled by them. Besides, additional expenses, such as costs related to fuel, maintenance, insurance, and parking, are borne by the service providers in the carsharing market.
Carsharing services are extremely useful for the general public, especially for daily commuters, as without owning and maintaining cars, they can reach their destination. For users, these services are available day and night throughout the year, allowing them to use a car from anywhere, anytime. Besides, with the help of the carsharing company’s mobile app, commuters can directly avail the services and easily rent the car of their choice. The apps offer the necessary details and every assistance to users, so that they have a good commuting experience. Hence, mobile apps, providing easy access to cars as well as all the information related to the service, are taking the carsharing market ahead.
Furthermore, carsharing helps save the expenditure on owned cars, fuel, maintenance, parking, and insurance. Carsharing services require users to pay only on the basis of the time and distance the car is being driven for, along with an initial registration cost. Also, other expenses, such as those for maintenance, insurance and fuel, are borne by the carsharing service providers. Due to benefits associated with sharing services, such as cost-efficiency and easy availability, the global carsharing market is expected to grow.
Hence, with the increasing inclination of people toward convenient mobility services, the global market for carsharing is witnessing a boost.
APAC standing as the largest market for carsharing services globally
APAC is expected to continue holding the largest share in the global carsharing market, with an estimated revenue of over 40% in 2018. Of all countries around the world, China continues to remain the largest market for carsharing services. In 2017, several cities across China increased the usage of electric vehicles across carsharing platforms to promote greener environment. With continuous support from the government in the form of policies and incentives, the market in China is expected to demonstrate robust growth in the future as well.

There’s a scene in the movie Planes, Trains and Automobiles where Steve Martin’s character, Neal, is dropped off in the middle of a rental car lot, looking for a car that isn’t there.
By the time he returns to the rental counter he’s frustrated, annoyed and tired.
It’s a relatable moment for many of us who travel as part of our jobs, but it’s one that is becoming rarer as business travelers opt for Uber and Lyft over car rentals.
New data from Epsilon-Conversant highlights this dramatic shift in the habits of business travelers.
Data shows that from Q2 2016 to Q1 2018, 63% of car rental customers reduced their spending on rentals and 56% stopped using car rental services entirely.
And while the insights show a clear trend towards rideshare services, there are growth opportunities for both rideshare and car rental companies.
Similar to many other industries, all signs point towards the need for evolution by both traditional car rental companies and rideshare services to stay competitive.
Here are three tips to help car rental and rideshare companies alike to co-exist and grow.
Surviving and thriving
Create personalized experiences where you can
Car rental companies can only take the personalized customer experience so far.
They can’t compete with rideshare services that allow riders to select the type of car picking them up and see the name of the driver, but they can do a handful of things to make the car rental experience much more enjoyable.
Focus on the digital and counter experiences where customers spend the bulk of time engaging with your brand.
Don’t sleep on peer-to-peer ridesharing
Peer-to-peer car services such as Drive Now, Reach Now and Getaround are popping up and pose a threat to both rideshare services and car rental companies.
Think about it: most cars spend most of their time sitting. Especially in major cities, cars might find themselves parked for days at a time unused.
Even in suburban areas, cars will sit in parking lots from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. as people work the day away.
There are opportunities for these differing business models to converge and provide the ultimate transportation experience for a wide array of consumer preferences and needs.
Identify opportunities for investment and/or joint-mobility ventures
While this is still a couple of years out, it won’t surprise me if a rideshare company snatches up a struggling rental car company or a rental car company invests in a peer-to-peer car sharing.
Consumer preferences shift depending on where they’re headed. It’s a matter of convenience.
I’m not going to treat my trip to Dallas the same as I would New York or Chicago. Investment or partnerships provide flexibility and the ability to reach individuals where they prefer.
Important steps to take
We’ve been down this road before. Blockbuster gave way to Redbox, which is now struggling keep up with Netflix. Instagram challenged Kodak as the most recognizable photo brand.
And today, direct-to-consumer brands are challenging their traditional counterparts with rich, first-party data.
Car rental companies should not take the $3.2 billion loss to rideshare companies lightly—the time to implement change, innovate and evolve is now.
In some instances, legacy brands not only adapt, but grow and thrive during a time of industry disruption.
Others flounder and die.
If they’re to survive, car rental companies must look holistically at the transportation industry and make the necessary changes that allow them to determine their own destiny.

A bike-sharing system built around the North Bay’s commuter rail line could debut this fall, adding new options for people to get around town while reducing local reliance on cars.
The plan envisions at least 300 bicycles stationed near Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit stops from Santa Rosa to Larkspur, as well as a few key sites in the more populated cities in Sonoma and Marin counties. The focus of the one-year pilot is increasing ways for passengers to get to and from the train, and then judging the program’s success for possible future expansion.
Eight potential suppliers have submitted proposals to the transportation authorities of Sonoma and Marin counties, which are partnering on the $800,000 grant-funded bike system. Transportation officials could pick the winner next week, setting themselves up this summer to fine-tune many of the details, including whether or not the bikes will be docked at central kiosks.
The bike-share program is slated to begin no later than next spring, and could start as soon as this fall.
“Our vision is to serve the whole corridor,” said Dana Turréy, senior planner with the Sonoma County Transportation Authority. “Bike-share systems are kind of designed around one-way trips, so we definitely need some coverage near the stations, but we’re really focusing on areas within fairly close proximity to SMART. We have some ideas, but exactly which ones kind of depends on the process with the vendor we select.”
Whether the new system will be comprised of traditional bicycles or the electric-assisted models growing in popularity around the country is for now another question left unanswered.
While the electric bikes require more oversight and are a little costlier to upkeep, they give riders a boost up to 20 mph as they pedal and have the advantage of appealing to a broader group of users, said Turréy.
The program aligns with SMART’s goal of improving so-called first- and last-mile connectivity, which emphasizes enhancing rider alternatives for getting to and from their final destinations.
Since starting passenger service in August 2017, about a third of passengers reported walking back and forth from their train stop. Bicycling ranked further down the list at 14%, behind driving and parking, and being dropped off by a non-paid service, according to a recent survey of riders.
A Marin County Civil Grand Jury report in April stated SMART had done a “commendable job” of developing first- and last-mile connections in its first year of operations, though expected more options to be added as the rail agency matures. Incorporating a successful bike-share program is part of the overall strategy.
“First- and last-mile stuff is super organic,” Joanne Parker, SMART’s programming and grants manager, told the agency’s board in April. “You figure out what works and you keep doing it, and you figure out what doesn’t work and then you change direction. We’re young. We look forward to aging gracefully from our toddler status.”
Cities across California have launched bike-share programs over the past few years that have continued to gain traction with local commuters and visitors alike. In the Bay Area, San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley and San Jose are part of the 4,500-bike Ford GoBike program, which is owned by ride-sharing service Lyft and was recently renamed Bay Wheels.

As shared mobility gains traction in India, 51 per cent of millennials are questioning the need to own a vehicle, according to a global study by Deloitte.
As per Deloitte’s 2019 Global Automotive Consumer Study, consumers in India feel empowered trusting the power of digital solutions that make their commute safer.
It also said 76 per cent of respondents in India were in favour of connected vehicles with 84 per cent feeling that connected vehicles will be beneficial in providing suggestions regarding safer routes along with updates to improve road safety and prevent potential collisions.
“Shared mobility is another trend which is gaining momentum in India. The report uncovers a clear generational divide when it comes to shared mobility,” Deloitte said.
Compared to the older generation, younger consumers are more likely to understand the idea of shared mobility and to question whether vehicle ownership is a necessity.
Therefore, ride-hailing has been integrated in some markets and the concept is progressing in India, the report added.
As per the report, 51 per cent of Gen Y/Z users in India are questioning the need for an owned vehicle, while 44 per cent of Gen X have similar thoughts.
On the other hand, only 34 per cent of pre/boomers generation have questioned the need for an owned vehicle, the Deloitte added.
Commenting on the findings, Deloitte India Partner Rajeev Singh said, “India is at the cusp of digital transformation as we see a whole new way of engagement, interactivity and consumption pattern. With that, the future is truly going to be driven by mobile connectivity and digital power.”
He further said even though the daily usage of personally owned vehicles in India is quite high, the cumulative vehicle sales for the country have seen a sharp decline over the last year.
“It is expected that the younger audience would subvert the trend of personally owned vehicles in the time to come with their growing affinity, towards shared mobility and digital technologies,” Singh said.
Currently in India, 47 per cent of consumers use their own vehicle everyday which is expected to increase to 50 per cent in the next three years, the report said.
As part the study, Deloitte said over 10,000 consumers across Australia, China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Southeast Asia shared their views on critical issues impacting the automotive sector.

As cities around the world move toward greater mobility, different transportation modes are being introduced, offering commuters more options to help get them to where they need to be. One such mode that has rapidly gained popularity around the globe in recent years is the electric scooter (e-scooter), often in the form of scooter-sharing startups. The trend is generating plenty of buzz, as well as concern.
Recently, scooter-sharing systems have been introduced in some parts of Thailand. Wander around Thong Lor and Ekamai today, and you’ll see orange e-scooters outside BTS stations and in front of cafes and restaurants. Increasingly, someone on a scooter will cruise past you on the pavement.
Neuron, a scooter-sharing company based in Singapore, introduced its line of orange e-scooters in Chiang Mai late last year. The company expanded its service to Thammasat University (Rangsit campus) in January, before coming to Bangkok in May. In the capital, the service area started out in Thong Lor before expanding from Asok to On Nut BTS stations, and Phetchaburi to Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre MRT stations. Collectively called the Thong Lor zone, Neuron provides around 200 e-scooters in this area. It is reported that users take approximately 500-600 trips daily within the zone.
The service comes with an app, and geo-fence and GPS tracking in each dockless scooter. Designated parking spots can be located using the in-app map. Neuron also employs staff to go around the area collecting scooters, replacing batteries and ensuring abandoned scooters don’t end up dumped together in ugly clutters.
“It’s not about simply buying scooters and placing them on the street. We look at it in terms of city planning too, as well as incorporating technology to keep things safe while helping with the smart city initiative,” said Nate Chanchareon, Neuron Mobility’s head of business development.


To avail of the service, users have to download the app and scan a QR code on the scooter. Then they just hop on and ride. The pay-per-ride rates start from 20 baht, with an additional 1 baht per minute. Daily, weekly and monthly rates are available. The scooters can reach speeds of 20-25km/h. Basic insurance is provided, helmets are not.



Staff regularly check on the scooter fleet throughout the day.

Nate said feedback from commuters has been positive. In Chiang Mai, many use it for tourism and leisure purposes. Within the university campus, students ride scooters from dorm to class, as well as for recreation. In Bangkok, the scooters are mainly being used for commuting purposes, connecting from the BTS/MRT to the home or workplace, providing a solution to the first-mile/last-mile (FMLM) connection problem, an attractive alternative to motorcycle taxis, taxis or walking.
“Consider any given Friday. The traffic is heavy. Some people may not want to ride on a motorcycle. Scooters can then be a faster option than cars and cheaper than a taxi for the first-mile/last-mile connection. They’re suitable for commuting short distances. The more options there are, the better they help ease the traffic,” said Nate. As they run on electricity, the scooters are also more eco-friendly.
Outside of Thailand, Neuron also provides scooter-sharing services in Singapore and Cyberjaya in Malaysia, and will be heading to Brisbane and Darwin in Australia soon.
Globally, scooter-sharing services have experienced strong growth since 2017, starting in Europe before making their way to the US and now Asia. However, despite the benefits, there are concerns over safety. According to Nate, some minor injuries have been reported from people falling over while using the scooters. There still is risk, of course, which Nate describes as “similar to riding a bicycle”.
Everywhere reacts to the arrival of e-scooters differently. For example, the Queensland authority issued regulations on helmets and speed limits. Riders can use footpaths only, not bike lanes or roads. In some locations, such regulations are not enough, with people seeking to ban the scooters altogether.
In Thailand, scooter-sharing is still in its infancy. While its usage is steadily growing, there are as yet no clear regulations in place. Assoc Prof Pawinee Iamtrakul, from the Faculty of Architecture and Planning at Thammasat University, says the use of scooters can be safe as long as regulations are in place.
“In a closed area like a university campus, which you don’t need to share with other vehicles, it’s quite safe to use scooters. But in other areas, it could be dangerous,” she said. “The state is the best entity to decide which zones could be used for sharing. They know what should and shouldn’t be allowed. In the end, we don’t want anyone to be in danger.”
This goes both ways. Users have to be educated on how to safely operate the scooters, and on which areas are safe to travel in. This will make it easier for the state to step in and impose appropriate regulations ensuring minimal disruption and maximum safety.
In Bangkok, authorities have been redoubling their efforts to clear the pavements for pedestrians by banning motorcycles and vendor carts. Is it ideal to throw scooters into the mix? Plus the precarious state of the city’s footpaths, already broken up and uneven, create difficulties for pedestrians. Surely scooters are not well suited to such terrain.
Pawinee believes it’s up to different sectors to come together and manage the sharing of space. If sections of footpaths can be cleared and then properly designated as areas for scooters and other mobility devices, she says, it could be beneficial to all, including pedestrians, senior citizens and people with disabilities.
“People have different limitations. Scooters are one option that can help them travel longer distances. It’ll be helpful to improve basic infrastructure to accommodate a diversity of users for greater connectivity, accessibility and safety,” she said.

The interface of the Neuron app shows the real-time locations of parking spots and available scooters in the Thong Lor area.

Additionally, she argues, e-scooters can be used to promote tourism and help local economies.
Despite the controversies and uncertainties that surround scooter-sharing, both Nate and Pawinee are confident that they have the potential to grow.
“As long as Thailand continues to have road traffic problems, people will seek alternatives,” said Nate. “If there’s a more reliable, faster, maybe even cheaper option, people will use it. In Bangkok, the infrastructure isn’t bad in all areas. There are places that may be good for using scooters.”
However, he pointed out, the pavements and bike lanes must be improved, and clear regulations put in place.
“It’s not just about business but also community,” he says. “We can strive for sustainable goals and be environmentally friendly. So, if more people learn to accommodate the scooters, it should help make Thailand more liveable. With safety concerns, we can put them on the table: let’s see what the problems are and try to solve them.
“Bangkok already has an established transit backbone in the shape of the MRT and BTS. The next thing to do is address first-mile/last-mile connections; improve them by providing more options, be they bicycles, scooters or something else. Set up designated lanes and make them safe. If we can do this, I think people would rely less on personal cars.”
Pawinee also underlined the importance of connectivity between small, medium and large transit modes. These should be designed to feed into each other seamlessly for added convenience and safety.
“Today, many people feel that using their own car is more convenient than using public transportation … With new options and development, they should be able to create a better society, beyond just commuting,” she said.

Neuron has partnered with local cafes and restaurants to set up parking spots outside.

BANGKOK TEST RIDE
It was pretty scary trying an e-scooter for the first time in Bangkok. The sight of uneven pavements, random manholes, pedestrians, vendor carts, trees, utility poles, motorcycles and everything else that clutter the city’s sidewalks and sois suggested an unpleasant ride. But to my surprise, the experience was much more pleasant than I’d anticipated.
I recently dropped by BTS Phrom Phong station to give the scooters a shot. My destination was Donki Mall, Thong Lor 10. As I’d already downloaded the application and linked my credit card, I was ready to go. A Neuron staff member who was checking on the scooters outside the station, gave me some basic instructions on how to operate the scooter and use the app.
Then I was off. Even for a first-timer, the scooter was easy to ride. The real challenge was to avoid all of obstacles and get to my destination in one piece. Sure enough, it proved to be difficult terrain. I spent half the time riding and the other half pulling and lifting the heavy scooter. I was drenched with sweat by the time I got to my destination, almost half an hour later, a distance of 3.4km. I paid 45 baht. Comparatively, the same trip using the Grab motorcycle taxi service is 48 baht and over 75 baht for a Grab taxi.
It was quite a tiring ride. But on the occasions when the pavement was long and obstacle-free, it was actually pretty fun zipping along on the scooter. The potential of this transportation mode is quite clear. I can see it becoming a practical and convenient option in places with better infrastructure and terrain. In Bangkok, it’s really crucial to take precautions and watch where we’re going. Another added plus is that I passed by some interesting local shops that I never really noticed when driving a car.

As we move towards the age of digitalization, data is being rightly called the ‘king’, as it is essential for taking better and informed decisions. With smart cities becoming the buzzword, the significance of data has only grown as it enables decision-makers to plan, build and maintain cities in a better way. Cities around the world are looking to function efficiently through connected networks to increase transparency, by allowing open access to data.
In such a scenario, mobility is an area which produces enormous data every second. As per a research report by ABI, the numerous vehicles commuting and connecting people to their destinations have huge potential of data generation that can boost the economic growth of smart cities by more than 3 percent and lead to additional benefits worth $20 trillion by 2026.
Importance of mobility data
Mobility data is generated from public transit agencies, private mobility solution providers and citizens. It is either derived in a primary manner through an organization’s own sensors, or through user applications. While collecting data from primary sources, it is often assumed that data is valuable and collecting more of it can provide benefits in the future. The other method is the secondary method, in which data is collected by acquiring existing datasets from other parties, with intent defined well in advance. In this case, only that data is acquired which is of use.
Mobility data is of great importance as it unlocks the maximum value that can help cities become smarter and provide better transport facilities to its citizens. For example, it can inform citizens about real-time information of arrival and departure of trains and buses, help them to choose options for last mile connectivity and help in reducing travel time by informing them about areas with heavy traffic and suggesting alternative routes. It also helps in reducing traffic congestion due to cars looking for parking space as it can provide parking availability information.
Mobility data also creates efficiencies for delivery vehicles by identifying the most efficient time slots and routes, and adjusting traffic/ parking rules during major events. Furthermore, this data can also be used for identifying road safety and security hotspots, thus enabling quick response and understanding the issues of those areas and how they can be rectified.
This data can also help city administrators to better design and maintain routes, public transit and mobility infrastructure. For example, analyzing traffic and commute patterns can help planners to decide where to build infrastructure and add transit routes to ease stress in heavy traffic areas. Through the flow of traffic, the structural health of transportation infrastructures such as bridges and overpasses can be monitored.
Mobility data also helps in effective enforcement of regulations, develop new and modify existing regulations to ensure smooth functioning of system. This data can allow regulators to see where violations occur frequently and collect tolls and parking fees efficiently.
Challenges in optimizing mobility data
Despite having great importance, there are numerous problems that block the proper utilization of mobility data. The first one is the lack of data sharing: companies still work in silos and the reasons for this are competition and privacy concerns. Thus, there needs to be a common platform where all data is available so that anyone can use it for better city management and decision-making.
On the other hand, data standardization is another challenge that obstructs data sharing. Cities are still struggling to establish a standard for data sharing for efficient management. Therefore, a proper data sharing mechanism is a must for using this data efficiently.

San Mateo, Calif., – July 24, 2019 –  Zuora, Inc., (NYSE:ZUO) the leading cloud-based subscription management platform provider, announced today that Omoove, the European leader in technology solutions for the mobility market, is using Zuora to manage and grow its subscription business and support the high usage-based billing volume of its customers including Enjoy, an Italian vehicle sharing service offered by Eni, the $86 billion multinational oil and gas company.
Omoove is a leading European technology service provider for intelligent mobility corporations, offering end-to-end shared mobility and fleet management technologies and solutions for vehicle sharing operators, fleet management companies and car makers. Omoove operates more than 20 intelligent mobility services across Europe with about 200,000 connected vehicles, 1 million registered users and more than 400,000 rentals per month (as of 30th June 2019).
The global transportation industry is increasingly being disrupted by new technology and changing customer preferences. According to the recent The End of Ownership survey conducted by the Harris Group on behalf of Zuora, 60 percent of Italian adults wish they could own fewer physical goods and 77 percent of Italian adults believe that in the future, people will subscribe to more services and own less. While car sales are declining in Europe, the ride-sharing market is growing at a 33.7 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and is expected to hit $4 billion by 2024. Omoove’s success is dependent on quickly adapting to such changes in consumer spending preferences.
As the era of ownership is closing, it is giving rise to the era of usership and Omoove is one of the companies leading the charge. In order to meet the evolving needs of its customers, Omoove offers flexible pricing and packaging options that can be customized to meet its various requirements. The company needed an enterprise monetization system which would help it grow with new pricing strategies like usage-based billing.
Omoove deployed Zuora to help it offer usage-based billing for one of its most important customers—Enjoy, a car-sharing service fully designed and owned by Eni to revolutionize mobility in the major Italian cities with easy access, competitive rates, and better customer experiences.
The Zuora platform enables Omoove to manage the entire payment and billing cycle of Omoove’s services and the extremely complex subscription billing based on several different factors including the type of car, miles driven, time, discounts, deposits, and extra fees for out of country driver’s licenses. 
“We understand that the “one-size-fits-all” approach does not work in the Subscription Economy. Using Zuora will help us meet the different needs of our diverse customer base and grow our business,” says Edwin M. Colella, VP Mobility  Sales & Marketing at Omoove. “We will now be able to offer customers more freedom to tailor packages to meet their unique needs. Omoove is proud to offer Enjoy, one of our most valued customers, the flexibility to pay based on how much they use our services. In the future, we will be looking at expanding Zuora to all our other customers around the world.”

You might have already seen people whooshing by on e-scooters and e-bikes on the sidewalks of your city. The flood of dockless transport has caught many, including policymakers, off guard. And with growing urbanization and increasingly flexible work schedules, demand for sharing programs offering portable transportation services will likely only grow.
“[P]rocess of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism,” said Joseph Schumpeter, a 20th-century Austrian economist, who believed that the opening up of any new market, or industry, is inevitably followed by the destruction of the old and creation of the new economic structure. Indeed, the rising tide of so-called last mile solutions serves a testament to that.
A somewhat similar, although much less overwhelming, bike-sharing craze that hit China is now spreading over the states. Companies like Bird, Lime, Lyft, Skip Spin (owned by Ford), and others all rush to get a piece of the action. Many already operate an e-scooter and/or e-bike sharing services in more than 25 states and Washington, D.C. All this in a span of less than a year. In the District alone, under a pilot program started in 2017, the District Department of Transportation has recently approved permits for eight companies, which could potentially more than double the number of electric devices from 2,400 to 6,000 available for rent this year.
Legislators are rushing to catch up, many are starting to roll out reasonable laws ensuring safety (e.g. limiting the speed of e-scooters to 10-15mph) and limiting the growth of the fleet (i.e. imposing caps on the number of shared vehicles any one company can operate). Some jurisdictions, like New York City, are struggling more than others.
New York City all but bans electric bikes and recently kicked the tires on e-scooter programs.  But, sometimes when local governments struggle, state legislatures can assist. Governor Andrew Cuomo’s proposed the fiscal year 2020 budget creates categories for both types of currently illegal vehicles, giving local authorities the power to legalize them if they wish. This could foreshadow New York City legalizing e-bikes and/or e-scooters later this year.
But while legislators are busy establishing boundaries for the young industry, the question remains whether this trend will last? Turns out, it may be here to stay.
“These e-scooters are being used. That tells you they’re filling a need,” said Douglas Shinkle, transportation program director at the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures. Indeed, many, including the top managers like Paul White of Bird, believe that dockless transport helps cut down on commute times and makes streets safer.
This makes sense, given that three among the world’s 25 most-gridlocked cities are in the United States, according to the latest INRIX Global Traffic Scorecard. Last year residents of Boston, Washington, D.C., and Chicago spent more than 138 hours stuck in traffic. New York, Los Angeles, and Seattle are the next biggest culprits.
But, avoiding road congestion might not be the only reason why many prefer to hop on an e-scooter these days. In fact, the increasing number of young individuals that are moving to urban areas looking for work, and increasingly flexible work schedules are few of the other key drivers of this creatively destructive phenomenon.
It is no secret that the Millennial generation has helped define the “sharing economy” with flexibility and portability features at its core: from cloud storage to car-sharing services like Uber. Certainly, some of it comes from financial restraints and a reluctance for ownership imposed by the 2007-08 financial crisis. But, more importantly, it feeds on a desire to optimize work-life balance and to be more productive. Flexible work schedules fit right into these preferences. For example, a 2014 study from Nicholas Bloom, a professor at Stanford University, found that employees who worked at home had quieter environments, increasing their productivity by 13 percent.
Further data backs this up. In 2012, 24% of employees in America were spending 80% or more of their time working remotely, according to Gallup. By 2016, already 31% were found to be doing the same. This allows many to work and network from anywhere in the city. Classical cafés, bakery-cafés, restaurants—you name it—all become more inviting to those working on a laptop. The rise of shared workspaces like WeWork is another indicator of the trend.
All this creates a natural push towards more portable, short-range transport solutions like e-scooters and e-bikes, a trend that is likely to persist. The dockless scooters can be parked anywhere in the service area. All that new rider has to do is to simply scan them on their phone and start riding.
This kind of transportation solution is pivotal in helping younger workers cut commute time, optimize their day-schedules, and perk up their productivity, translating into more rapid economic growth. Given these benefits, these programs should not be crushed by unnecessary regulation. Policymakers should provide room for experimentation through pilot programs, while only cautiously enacting sensible laws that would truly ensure the safety of new riders.

As integrated payments technology continues to evolve and internet of things technology expands the automation of voice control and natural language, the auto industry is increasingly looking at mobile purchasing as another key feature of the connected home experience.
The same technology used to turn off the lights, lower the temperature and secure the front door is being used to in car navigation systems, unlocking and starting the car on a winter morning and buying a morning cup of coffee, paying bridge and highway tolls and pre-ordering a breakfast muffin.
Honda announced what it calls the first integrated driver and passenger infotainment system called Honda Dream Drive, which provides customers with the ability to enjoy a range of voice controlled services through the car dashboard, including the ability to pay for everything from gasoline to parking and food pickup without the need for drivers to pull out a mobile app on their phone.
Honda worked with Visa and a firm called Connected Travel on the project, but also lined up partnerships with several major brands, including Atom Tickets, Chevron, Phillips 66, GrubHub and has expanded in-vehicle payment partners to include Mastercard and PayPal.
“The direction that we’ve taken and the path that we’ve taken is around tokenizing the payment method for the customer so that can then be used for a variety of different merchants that we’ve integrated into our platform,” said John Moon, managing director, strategic partnerships at Honda.
He said Honda has been working with Visa as early as 2016 on developing the connected car payments functionality, including lining up a group of merchants that can be integrated into a unified platform.
The automaker has since added Mastercard and PayPal as payment partners to offer additional payment options to customers.
Korean automaker Hyundai is also working to develop a connected car platform with the ability to accept payments.
Connected car technology has evolved over the past several years, as automakers looked to automate more of the driving experience, using dashboard entertainment systems to integrate with IoT technologies like smart home functions, autonomous driving technologies to improve driver safety and offer an ever expanding list of entertainment and information options.
Jaguar was one of the first automakers to offer an in-car payment system in February 2017, developing a system using touch screen controls to pay for gasoline through the Shell payment app. Jaguar included the Shell payment technology in the 2018 models of the XE, XF and F-Pace models and launched the ability to buy through the app in the U.K. using PayPal and Apple Pay initially and Android Pay added later in 2017.
General Motors in December 2017 announced its connected Marketplace application, which allowed customers to buy everything from Shell gasoline to Starbucks Coffee and Dunkin Donuts. The 4G LTE technology, developed with Seattle-based Xevo, Austin, Texas-based Conversable and Atlanta-based Sonic Mobile was built into select 2017 and 2018 cars, trucks and crossover vehicles from Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac.
Hyundai announced plans in 2018 to develop a connected car experience with Xevo that would include a payments component. The system would connect Hyundai’s Blue Link connected car technology to the Xevo Market, which offers the ability to buy gas, parking and other items.
“Hyundai is looking to simplify things for customers using this technology,” said company spokesman Miles Johnson.
He said a full rollout of the payments component in was still in development, noting that the company would likely pilot some of the technology before launching with limited partners.
No distractions
Some of the main concerns around connected car technology include ease of use, security and for those making payments while driving, safety is a key issue, according to Eric Hoarau, senior director of automotive technology at Flex, a firm that specializes in IoT technology for homes, healthcare and automotive.
“Most payment systems right now are connected through the cloud for security and authentication,” he said via email, “actually having point to point communication between a car and a drive thru restaurant requires V2X capabilities and secure infrastructure that can talk directly to a local payment point.”
He noted that safety is key, as entering a PIN code or password to authenticate would require the user stop the car somewhere and voice commands need some form of authentication.
He said consumers might trust a more established automaker than a start-up app before they test the limits of secure payments.
Connected technology
Beyond the major automakers, there are mobile providers and technology companies competing in this space as well.
Amazon announced plans in September 2018 to launch Echo Auto, an invitation-only device that allows users to connect Alexa skills to their car using the car’s audio jack or bluetooth connection. The company is working with automakers, including Ford, BMW and Toyota,  to bring this technology into more vehicles, according to a spokesperson.
“We have the Alexa Auto SDK which includes everything that automakers need to integrate Alexa into their infotainment system,” Amazon spokesperson Jill Tornifoglio said via email.
The technology operates basically the same as it would in the home, where users can issue voice commands and if there are Alexa skills for payment, then drivers would be able to make purchases just like if they are speaking into an Echo device.
Harman International, which was acquired by Samsung in 2017,  is demonstrating its Harman Ignite 3.0 connected car platform through an integration with Samsung Pay, according to a spokesperson for Harman.
Harman introduced the Ignite 3.0 platform at CES this week as a new connected ecosystem for car makers to offer a connected marketplace for customers, giving them the ability to use a virtual assistant to control smart home functions like thermostats, locks and home security through the Samsung SmartThings platform and gives access to third-party developers through downloadable apps.
AT&T previously announced an agreement in September 2018 to begin selling the Harman Spark, which is a plug in device that Harman developed with an automobile software firm called Tantalum. The device, which plugs into the car similar to the devices provided by insurance companies, provides safety tracking, roadside service, offers streaming Wi-Fi, and other services such as paying for parking.

In 2019, the world relies on various forms of transportation more than ever before to get around on a day-to-day basis. Whether it’s heading to the supermarket for weekly shopping, traveling to work, visiting friends and family, or going abroad for a week in the sun, the world today has access to buses, trains, planes, bicycles, trams, and many more modes of transport, making it the easiest it’s ever been to travel both short and long distances across the globe.
Over the last 200 years, transportation has completely transformed. In 1804 the first steam railway was built. In 1885-1886 the first credited automobile was created by Karl Benz in Germany, 1903 saw the creation of the first powered aircraft, and in 1942 the first ever rocket reached space. The transportation industry has clearly hit some huge milestones over the past 200 years.
So, how will transport evolve by 2100?
We live in a digital age where technology has become entwined and embedded in our society. This technological revolution has impacted all industries, including transport, with the world now witnessing self-driving cars, drones that can deliver goods to your doorstep, and billionaires who are hoping to transport humans to Mars in the next couple of decades.
RS Components has collated the most exciting predictions set to take place over the next century in this graphic. Are you ready for the changes set to happen in the transport industry?
Autonomous Cars
Driverless cars have been discussed for a long period of time now by the likes of Elon Musk, who has recently claimed that a true self-driving Tesla will exist by 2020, where passengers could even snooze in the driver’s seat while the car takes you from point A to B.
Autonomous car technology is also being developed by the likes of BMW and Mercedes, however this development is still very much in its testing stages. Having said that, these tests are set to be implemented by 2025, which is predicted to be the year this development emerges further and is implemented with the concept of driverless taxis. Will Elon Musk beat this with his Tesla’s?
The result of driverless cars is that there will no longer be a need to own a personal car, instead people can choose to subscribe to car-sharing driverless plans.
Drive through the Skies
By 2050 global populations are expected to reach 9.8 billion. At the same time, the UK population is expected to exceed 70 million [2] by 2030, growing by a further 7 million [3] to reach 77 million by 2050.
This large growth in population across the world and the UK will lead to a huge increase in the number of road users and other systems of transportation as they look to commute for work and leisure.
While the number of people traveling will increase, the capacity of routes currently available are unlikely to keep pace due to the road and underground systems being restricted in the routes and numbers they can hold. As such, humans will need to look for alternative transport routes.
For these reasons, the Irish SpaceX Hyperloop pod competition team, Éirloop, has predicted that humans will be “driving in the sky” where far more space can be found than on roads or underground. This will allow for higher volumes of people to travel and at higher speeds, cutting travel times.
Fly in Style
When we fly to our desired destination, lots of us peek our heads through the window to see the beautiful sights below as we are cruising through the skies. Unfortunately, at the moment the view is limited on most planes with the windows being small in size. By 2030 this is all set to change, as these windows will be replaced altogether by the fuselage becoming a big screen. Not only will this give passengers a far more impressive view, it will also make the aircraft lighter and faster, seeing less fuel burnt as a result.
Travel to Space via Hyperloop
Traveling to space is a dream nearly all of us share, as we look up to the skies and wonder what it might be like to transport out of Earth and experience outer space. While in the past space has always been reserved for the most advanced astronauts, this is all set to change in the future with the rise of commercial travel to space, which has become increasingly topical as billionaires such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson are all working to get people into space over the next couple of decades.
But by 2100, it is expected that space travel will be taking place via Hyperloop, which will transport passengers to other colonies outside of Earth.
A Green Future
Governments are currently undergoing huge policy changes to ensure cars become emission free over the next two decades, by banning gas- and diesel-powered cars due to the air pollution problems they cause. By 2030 it is predicted that all ground transport, including cars, buses, and trains, will be driven by renewable energies to tackle this global issue.
In the same year airplanes will have no windows, but rather the fuselage will be a big screen, making the aircraft lighter as a result which will mean less fuel is being burnt.
Are you ready for the next century of transport?

The upgrade to 5G networks is not only going to transform industries, businesses, and consumers with intelligent connectivity. Low-latency connectivity plays a paramount role enabling an array of smart city applications including smart urban agriculture to real-time detection of crime to intelligent traffic management and, of course, self-driving cars.



Mobile networks and services can both help municipalities improve and manage transport through a city either by car, public transport, or on foot. Mobility is changing rapidly around the world. Passengers and travellers are given more options with added flexibility in how they get from point A to point B.
How future cities manage transport will also change as the result of citizens becoming increasingly demanding. The cities’ local governments are thus going to employ more diverse and innovative means of transport. Autonomous drones used as air taxis for a solo passenger are also going to be seen frequently in the skies, together with other means of air mobility. 
Connecting transport and IoT in a smart city
In the recent Smart Mobility Congress in Barcelona, Spain global industry leaders discussed future transport options in a smart city. In just a few years’ time, transport can become much more efficient and relevant through the use of connected sensors, big data, mobile applications, and mobile payments. As they provide the connectivity that is enabling these changes, mobile operators are best placed to advise on how to meet the different transportation challenges of the future.







Cities are getting smarter every day. Municipalities are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICT) to enrich and enhance city life, which is paramount in planning the cities of the future. The rapid growth and expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) result in a fundamental impact on the development of smart cities and their mobility options.
The IoT drives efficiencies and delivers rich new services that have a positive impact in urban life. However, without effective strategies in place, cities can be unable to capitalize on these benefits.
As part of the GSMA Connected Living programme, an initiative that lets operators add value and accelerate the delivery of new connected devices and services in the Internet of Things (IoT), the Smart Cities project is collaborating with mobile operators and a number of cities to create real, long-term benefits for businesses and citizens through IoT technologies.
Connecting vehicles to their surroundings
A wide array of applications, services, and technologies can connect a vehicle to other vehicles (V2V), to the infrastructure, and to its surroundings. A connected vehicle includes the different communication devices, which can be embedded or portable, present in the vehicle that enables in-car connectivity with other devices present in the same vehicle.
A connected vehicle also enables connection of the vehicle to external devices, networks, applications, and services. These applications can include anything and everything from traffic safety and efficiency, infotainment, parking assistance, roadside assistance, remote diagnostics, and telematics to autonomous self-driving vehicles and global positioning systems (GPS).
What is a connected vehicle?
Typically, within the scale of the six levels of autonomous driving, vehicles that include interactive advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs) and cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) can be regarded as connected. Connected-vehicle safety applications are designed to increase situation awareness and mitigate traffic accidents through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications.
ADAS technology can be based on vision/camera systems, sensor technology, vehicle data networks, V2V, or V2I systems. Features may include adaptive cruise control, automate braking, incorporate GPS and traffic warnings, connect to smartphones, alert the driver to hazards, and keep the driver aware of what is in the blind spot.
In terms of safety, V2V communication technology could mitigate traffic collisions and improve traffic congestion by exchanging basic safety information such as location, speed, and direction between vehicles within range of each other. It can supplement active safety features, such as forward collision warning and blind-spot detection.
Connected vehicles technologies are also going to be a fundamental component of automated driving as they will allow the exchange of sensor and awareness data among vehicles, cooperative localization and map updating, as well as facilitate cooperative maneuvers between automated vehicles. 




Electric cars and smart cities
Perhaps Tesla is the most talked about of all electric cars, even though there are many other auto-makers in the electric and connected vehicle market as well. According to InsideEVs, Tesla Model 3 was the number one selling plug-in electric car in Canada for September 2018. This comes along with the news that Tesla Model 3 is the safest car that has has been tested, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

The Hyderabad Metro Rail project still lacks an efficient first and last-mile connectivity and a common ticket for different commutes even as it sees a steady rise in passengers with the number inching towards three-lakh mark every day.
Once the Raidurg station on Corridor 3 gets operational, trains with better frequency would ensure more passengers to hop in and ease crowd pressure during peak hours, but a lot more effort is needed to make the first and last-mile connectivity towards metro stations reliable and affordable.
Shuttle services are being run by some firms at Hi-Tec City and Durgam Cheruvu stations, while the L&T Metro Rail is running them from stations like Secunderabad East, Tarnaka, Mettuguda and others. Yet, these are either insufficient or the frequency of 15-30 minutes is not working out, if passengers reactions are anything to go by.
“I have shifted back to MMTS, which is less-crowed and also convenient to get transport from the railway station to my office at Kondapur. Metro ride was comfortable, but after alighting at Hi-Tec City, it is a nightmare to get into shuttle bus or shared auto-rickshaws packed to capacity,” says Kusuma, an IT professional, travelling from Begumpet.
“Unless you share the auto, the fare is flat ₹50 or ₹100 at metro stations to travel to nearby offices or residences,” was the most heard comment. Kalpana, a banking professional, thinks it is more convenient to take a shared cab from Mahendra Hills to Jubilee Hills Check Post than travel in metro.
“Commute by auto or cab to Parade Grounds station from home and again to office from Jubilee Hills Check Post metro station is more than double the metro ticket fare. It is more convenient to take a shared cab with my colleagues,” she says. Or take the case of Murthy, a private sector employee, commuting to Begumpet from Bandlaguda.
He changes two buses or shared autos to reach Nagole/Uppal metro station spending ₹40 in either direction.
Those sharing a cab shell out about ₹50-₹80 per head to catch the metro rail moving towards Ameerpet and from onward to Hi-Tec City. “We have an RTC depot in the vicinity, but after a couple of months of shuttle services, they were withdrawn,” says Mr. Murthy.
“Time travelled in metro is being wasted waiting for half-hour shuttle service every day,” tweeted Prashant M., travelling to DLF from Hi-Tec City. And, the promise of a common ticket for use through metro, auto, cabs, bus and train could have prevented unfettered fare rip-offs, but it is not in sight.

Commuting these days isn’t what it used to be. Instead of trying to draw workers into Boston, some Massachusetts businesses are often trying to get their most coveted employees to leave the city — at least for the work day.
Creating solutions to the so-called “first mile/last mile problem” helps make that possible. It means providing a way for workers to both get to the train — the first mile — and then how to get them to work — the last mile.
This is true in many parts of the state, but especially in the fast-growing region west of Boston.
Paul Matthews is the executive director of the 495/Metrowest Partnership, a coalition of 35 communities from Westford to Foxboro. For years, he and others have been trying to make the commuter rail work, not only for businesses in Boston, but also the other way around — for the growing industries along Route 495. But Matthews said to make the train truly viable, you must get people from train stations to their workplaces.
“This is New England,” Matthews said. “You can’t get off the train in January and walk 2.5 miles to your place of work. You need a way of stepping onto a shuttle and getting there.”
That shuttle most often takes the form of a van seating up to 16 people. But providing those shuttles to the almost 200,000 people working in MetroWest but living elsewhere is requiring people to get creative.




Doug Halley is the transportation coordinator for the town of Acton and for the CrossTown Connect Transportation Management Association, an effort funded by seven Massachusetts towns trying to get commuters out of their cars. Halley said they provide door-to-door service for seniors and for those with physical disabilities, and do commuter shuttles for area businesses. The shuttles drive local residents to the commuter rail so they can work in Boston, and bring workers coming in from Cambridge and Boston to work at companies along Route 495.





Halley thinks the MBTA could do a lot more to promote what’s called “reverse commuting” by lowering, or even eliminating, outbound fares.
“The trains are virtually empty,” Halley said. “Why even worry about charging those people coming out? Once they establish the ridership base, they can start increasing those fares, but initially they should be encouraging people to come out here. The businesses out here need them.“
In some cases, the employees need the shuttles as well. Peter Lowitt, who manages economic development for the office park at Fort Devens in central Mass., said many of the 130 reverse commuters at Devens depend on the commuter rail and the shuttle.
“In many cases, but for the shuttle bus, those folks wouldn’t be employed,” Lowitt said. “I was speaking with a gal who commutes out from Cambridge and she said she wouldn’t have taken the job if the commuter rail wasn’t here.”
MBTA officials have acknowledged they haven’t done enough to promote reverse commuting, but are now talking about testing reduced fares for reverse commuters — though not on all rail lines, and not on the Fitchburg train that serves Devens.
The state is also pledging to give more support to the shuttle van programs as a way to solve the first mile/last mile problems. Earlier this month, the MassDOT announced it would give $1.5 million to organizations like CrossTown Connect that can come up with creative solutions.
An example is the Maynard/Acton Commuter Shuttle, which connects people to the South Acton Train Station two and a half miles outside of town. It also transports workers coming in from Boston to their jobs in Maynard. Usage of the shuttle has grown in three years, from 100 rides per month up to 800.
The commuter shuttles that run in Maynard, Acton, Littleton and four other nearby towns are examples of the kinds of collaborative approaches that Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack says the state is looking to fund.
“The reason people aren’t trying other ways of commuting to work and driving by themselves is not lack of information. It’s actually lack of services,” Pollack said at a recent transportation conference.
Some advocates think the state could be doing more to promote these first mile/last mile services, like shuttles. Once people learn the shuttles are there and start using them, they keep using them. And as ridership grows, it means more people are getting to and from work without using their cars.
That fulfills what Pollack says is today’s transportation imperative: “To move more people in fewer vehicles.”

The smart cities initiatives by the governments of various countries including the U.S., Spain, Ireland, India, Singapore, and Sweden are expected to speed up the mobility on demand market expansion. The governments are providing incentives to the people to share rides while commuting and converting the existing public fleet of vehicles to electric vehicles. For instance, under the smart city project, the Vienna Model Region is developing e-mobility on demand to integrate the transportation system with the e-car sharing model effectively.
The legalization of ride-hailing services, such as Uber and Grab, by the government of Malaysia will drive the mobility on demand market growth in the region.
The government of Malaysia has made amendments to the Commercial Vehicles Licensing Board (CVLB) Act and Land Public Transport Act to allow the ride-hailing operators to work as an intermediary. The intermediary business license will allow these operators to facilitate transactions and booking of these services.
Mobility on demand market has seemingly brought about an upsurge in the development of autonomous vehicles. For instance, Uber is investing heavily in bringing driverless cars to the roads as estimates show that 60% to 80% of the revenues remain with the car owner.
By eliminating the need of a driver, ride hailing services like Uber are persevering to keep most of the revenue with the service provider. The profit perspective is highly motivating the development of driverless and autonomous cars, that are in turn expected to profoundly change mobility on demand market trends within the next 5 to 15 years.
The success of ride hailing services such as Lyft, Uber, and Ola has come to be highly dependent on new mobility on-demand market players, as they strive to build trust with key stakeholders such as regulators, consumers, insurers and investors.

With e-commerce booming and more consumers shopping online, the push towards speedier fulfillment approaches and efficient last-mile logistics is strong. In the race to implement new technologies, experiment with new transportation approaches and utilize efficient packaging techniques, shippers must be able to entice customers and keep them coming back for more.
Getting this right isn’t easy in a world where the nearest competitor is literally one mouse click away.
The good news is that by expanding omni-channel inventory selection, adopting diverse last-mile service offerings and assessing the cost of goods sold (COGS), a company can effectively leverage a dynamic, last-mile delivery strategy that meets their customers’ needs while helping them maintain and grow their own bottom lines.
In this Insider Q&A, ProShip’s Global Project Management Director and Co-Founder, Justin Cramer, explains the challenges shippers are grappling with, discusses changing customer expectations and shows how the right blend of technology is helping companies of all sizes conquer their biggest last-mile delivery obstacles.
Insider Q&A:
Justin Cramer — Global Project Management Director and Co-Founder, ProShip
Q: What key e-fulfillment and last-mile challenges are shippers dealing with right now?
A: Customer expectations are changing, and companies have to be able to keep up with these demands. It’s about providing an “intended experience” to those customers, which means meeting the transit time for their shipments. Doing this in a cost-effective way and still turning a profit has gotten difficult.
Q: Why can’t companies afford to ignore this any longer?  
A:  Because the mammoths of the industry are competing with one another on same-day delivery and free shortened-duration deliveries. Amazon, Target and Walmart are setting the bar in which that all small- to mid-sized retailers are now pushed to find a way to equal or exceed. 
Q: What’s the root of the problem?
A:  Companies that have a small amount of inventory origins are really limited in terms of the last-mile solutions that they can use. This prohibits them from providing an excellent customer experience in a cost-effective way—at least on a transaction basis.
Q: How can companies conquer this? 
A:  Shippers have to be able to maximize their number of inventory sources by using an omni-channel inventory approach. That’s the key to opening up the use of last-mile services that fit within the customer experience. It all starts with internal inventory locations, which retailers have two of—distribution center inventory and store inventory. So, even if that company has a handful of stores, the odds are that an order’s origin is now significantly closer to a larger set of customers.
We see this with a lot of the larger stores, many of which are shipping 50% or more of their orders directly from their stores. This allows them to be closer to their customer. Now, retailers also have to consider their external sources of supply (i.e., their vendors) because they can often execute shipping from their manufacturing facilities or third-party logistics (3PL) providers. It’s not uncommon to see large retailers securing 3PLs to help them through peak, for example.
Q:  Is this helping companies manage their final-mile deliveries?
A:  Yes, because it opens up options for them. If we look at a retailer that has an inventory location within a few hundred miles of every customer, it can now use postal last-mile solutions to deliver two-day services. Using these extra available inventory origins lowers the cost of shipping and ensures that delivery promises are met.
Q:  What steps should companies be taking now to improve their final-mile strategies and better meet their customers’ demands?
A:  The first step is to implement and use a good order management system (OMS). This one step will help companies ensure that the inventory is where it needs to be at the right time. OMS software includes specific functionalities that can give shippers a high level of confidence that the inventory will be there when they need it. This is critical because it eliminates the possibility of selling an item and then finding out that the last one on the store shelf sold an hour ago (but wasn’t entered into the system yet because the retailer’s point of sale [POS] system isn’t integrated with its OMS).
Now, the second step is to use shipping software that can take an expectation and find the lowest cost service to realize it from that location. In other words, if a company gets an order in by 1 p.m.—a typical cutoff for same-day shipments—and if it’s a busy day in the store, then that order may get pushed back resulting in an unmet shipping deadline. If, however, that company has an OMS with boomerang capabilities built into it and that order hasn’t been fulfilled within a certain timeframe (a certain number of minutes, hours, etc.), then the order “boomerangs” back and gets reallocated to another inventory source. This allows shippers to effectively react to get their orders to their customers on time.
Q:  What else needs to be done?
A:  Number one, the retailer needs to know when the pickup is going to be for a particular carrier. So, if the pickup is at 5 p.m. and it’s already 6:30 p.m., then that changes the services a shipper can use because the amount of time it takes for a given carrier to transit those services does not change. So, a 2-day delivery is going to stay a 2-day delivery, and a 3-day ground time in transit is exactly that; the transit time doesn’t start until that package is in the carrier’s custody. These are all important considerations from our perspective because applying the shipping label, determining when the carrier will actually take custody of the shipment and meeting the customer’s expectations all go into deciding which last-mile service to use.
Q:  What about same-day deliveries? How are they best handled?
A:  Companies like Deliv, Postmates, DHL and FedEx are all doing same-day delivery services now. So, let’s say a couture brand that’s selling highly-desirable goods offers same-day delivery to those customers who are willing to pay for it. Even with expanded inventory sources, the ideal OMS must be able to accurately inform the company’s e-commerce suite of exactly what can be delivered same-day for that customer.
If the couture brand has a warehouse or a retail location near the customer, it can pick that item and turn it over to Deliv, Postmates, or another carrier—but only if that item is in the customer’s region and appearing on the website with a same-delivery option. Now, in bigger cities like New York, Chicago or Los Angeles, where the brand has multiple stores, that exercise is fairly easy to accomplish.
But what about the rest of the country, where there’s just one store, DC, or even none at all? That’s where the real challenge comes in. That retailer needs to make it clear that the item is not available for a same-day delivery. Getting that message out clearly requires a 3-pronged integration that includes the e-commerce suite, the OMS, and the shipping software.
Q:  How many carriers should shippers be working with and why?
A:  Customers expect to have multiple shipping options at their disposal, which requires multiple carriers. Including multiple carriers supports the decision-making process with more choices and more opportunities to find the lowest-cost solution that will meet or exceed that customer’s expectation. At this point, companies should be set up to switch between carriers and take advantage of modern last-mile services like Deliv and Postmates.
And while no one knows where delivery trends are heading—10 years from now, drones may be handling most deliveries—the shippers that use multi-carrier shipping software and a multi-carrier strategy today will be best equipped to take advantage of these options. Wherever the industry is headed, it will be a lot easier to adapt to—and much less risky—for the company that’s not single-carrier/single-source.
Q:  How does the cost of goods sold (COGS) come into the picture here?
A:  A lot of companies today are still using classic COGS to do the math, when in reality they should be using cost-per-transaction. For example, a retailer’s labor and holding costs may be most affordable at a particular DC, but the shipping costs from that location may amount to more than sending the order out from another inventory source (i.e., a retail store). If that company can achieve a particular commitment to a customer while cutting its shipping costs by 25% or 50%, that may offset the increased holding and labor costs of going to an external source or to a store. Figuring this out takes shipping systems that do the math within milliseconds so that no one has to think about it.
Q:  What systems does a shipper need to be able to use cost-per-transaction?
A:  It takes an integrated enterprise software stack that can move the data around between the e-commerce components, POS, OMS, enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, warehouse management system (WMS) and shipping software. Having great data flow among all of those platforms probably isn’t something that operations thinks about, but it’s definitely something that IT thinks about. If the data flows and is congruent across all systems and pulled into them in real-time, then shippers have the power and freedom to make changes and decisions that ensure the customers get exactly what they want, when they want it. 
Q:  What else should shippers be thinking about at this moment?
A:  Everyone is focused on customer attraction and retention, and on living up to the experience that customers expect. Otherwise, they’ll go elsewhere to get the experience that they want. The mega-brands out there—Amazon, Walmart, and Target—are setting these expectations. By assembling a software stack that can manage the end-to-end supply chain, companies of all sizes can meet, and possibly even exceed, industry standards that customers are looking for. This is critical in a world where each new generation of consumers brings with it a new set of expectations, and where vendor loyalty is getting harder and harder to retain.

Car giants General Motors and BMW are backing blockchain tech as a way to share self-driving car data among themselves and other automakers.
It’s all part of a bid to unlock valuable data held in silos which will ultimately get autonomous vehicles on the road sooner. Exploratory work in this area is being done under the auspices of the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI), a consortium formed last year to harmonize the development of distributed ledger technology (DLT) across the “smart mobility” industry.
CoinDesk has learned that the next MOBI working group on so-called autonomous vehicle data markets (AVDM) will be chaired by General Motors (GM). The automaker has clearly been thinking about using blockchain to share data for some time, having filed a patent detailing such a system for fleets of self-driving cars at the end of last year.
The new AVDM working group chairman Michal Filipowski, manager global innovation of General Motors, told CoinDesk in an email:

“I am excited to chair the AVDM working group and kickoff the development of our collaborative efforts with the other OEM [original equipment manufacturers] and supplier MOBI members.”

And notably, BMW, a founding member of MOBI, has also expressed its interest in the data-sharing use case for the first time. (Previously BMW tested blockchain to track mileage of leased vehicles.)
The German manufacturer, like many others in the auto space, has realized that keeping self-driving data in silos is a “major barrier” to widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles.
“With the advent of blockchain, decentral[ized] data management can be implemented in a privacy-preserving and efficient way,” Andre Luckow, blockchain lead at BMW Group, told CoinDesk. “Further, emerging technologies, such as decentral machine learning, secure multi-party confidential computing, and decentral data markets, will provide the fabric for data processing in the autonomous age.”
Stepping back, the push to foster autonomous vehicles faces a key hurdle: the sheer volume of data self-driving cars must consume in order to “learn” how to drive in different places and scenarios. Driving around a test track is one thing, but negotiating a busy city center on a rainy day is quite another.
Crown jewels
According to a Rand Corp report, getting to the stage where AVs are safe in all conditions could take hundreds of billions of self-driven miles, a process by which data are gathered using cameras and Lidar (a detection system which works on the principle of radar, but uses light from a laser).
Pooling this data together to train artificial intelligence on might seem like a no-brainer, but autonomous vehicle companies – be they carmakers or Uber or Google-affiliated, Waymo – tend to think of their self-driving data as their crown jewels.
This is where blockchain comes in, explains Sebastien Henot, head of business innovation at the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance Innovation Lab in the Silicon Valley (who chairs MOBI’s vehicle identity working group). He told CoinDesk:

“The old fashioned way is that everybody thinks their data alone is so precious. The new way is to consider data sets like cooking ingredients: you need to be able to mix multiple ones to create something really valuable. Data marketplaces call technically for blockchain because you can create an environment where rules are clear in terms of who shares what data with who.”

Another MOBI member, Ocean Protocol (which went live Monday), is focused on the creating blockchain-based data markets and running a shared AI on them. Ocean co-founder Trent McConaghy is aiming to create a kind of enterprise data commons where everyone can benefit, yet at the same time, this data can be prevented from escaping beyond the firewalls of any one company.
McConaghy explained that Ocean takes “federated machine learning” (machine learning built without direct access to training data, where data remains in its original location, such as on a smartphone, for instance) and gives it an additional dose of decentralization.
Google and others have been “pushing pretty hard on centralized federated learning,” said McConaghy, where they control the whole process.
“The makes the holders of the data feel pretty uneasy. So if you can actually remove that creepiness and the process of learning if done from silo to silo to silo in a decentralised fashion, that is much better. Decentralised federated leaning is what Ocean unlocks,” he told CoinDesk.
And this more decentralized approach is what BMW and GM, as part of AVDM group at MOBI, seem to be enthusiastic about.
Michael Ortmeier of BMW Group IT communications said Ocean’s approach to data sharing is one the company is “following with great interest.”
“We used the opportunity of the MOBI colloquium to speak with Ocean and other members and we will definitely continue and intensify these discussions,” he said.
Waymo data
It’s no secret that Waymo, the self-driving technology development company owned by Google parent Alphabet, is further ahead than anyone else in terms of how much data it has collected.
However, if you run the numbers, says Chris Ballinger, the founder and CEO of MOBI, it could still take many years for Waymo get there on its own.
Ballinger, the former head of mobility at Toyota, estimates that Waymo is accumulating a million miles of self-driven miles a month, adding:

“So you can say in miles it’s going to take millennia. Something has to be done and obviously it will speed up as more cars get on the road. Once everybody gets involved and once they start sharing it will be an order of magnitude increase.”

However, Vint Cerf, vice president and chief internet evangelist for Google, countered the claim the Waymo might way off when it comes to reaching its AV goals.
It depends what you mean by “driving data,” said Cerf. “We have billions of miles in simulation by generating direct inputs into the software that emulate what the sensors see,” he told CoinDesk by email.
Regards the possibility of car companies using blockchain networks to share data, Cerf added:

“I do not see additional value in the overhead of blockchain vs digital signatures.”

BOULDER, Colo. (BRAIN) — Cycling advocates are casting a wary eye on bills pending in several statehouses that seek to legalize electric scooters. Their concerns aren’t with e-scooters as such, but with the scooter industry’s attempts to classify them as legally identical to bikes or electric bikes.
The scooter industry’s growth, and its much publicized disputes with local officials, has led to a glut of bills across the country. Legislatures in more than half the states are considering scooter-related bills this year. The bills that redefine scooters as bikes are the most troublesome for bike advocates.
“I really don’t want a scooter-related bill that defines scooters as bikes to get passed, and then have that bill reopened down the road because there are issues and safety implications with scooters,” said Morgan Lommele, director of state and local policy for PeopleForBikes and for the Bicycle Product Suppliers Association.
Bikes and electric scooters share many common interests, and both are seen as viable ways to reduce car traffic and make cities more livable and environmentally friendly. Some electric scooter-sharing companies also run bike-share systems and are members of the PeopleForBikes Coalition.
“I think there is an existential crisis for the industry as to who we are,” — Randy Neufeld, director of the SRAM Cycling Fund
But cycling advocates worry that safety issues or other problems with scooters could disrupt the bike industry’s success in legalizing e-bikes. PFB and the BPSA have been chipping away at passing model e-bike bills in state legislatures. The model bill creates three classifications for e-bikes, and the industry has gotten the bill, or something close to it, passed in 14 states so far.
Lommele said she is tracking 41 scooter bills pending in 27 states. The measures seek to provide a legal footing for scooters and scooter-share services.
While legalizing and regulating scooters is fine with the bike industry, Lommele said the industry objects to giving scooters legal parity with bikes, or treating bike-share and e-bike-share systems the same as scooter-sharing systems.
She cited one problematic scooter-sharing bill that is pending in the California Assembly. One provision of AB-1286 would require the operator of a scooter- or bike-share system to maintain general liability insurance. That would eliminate the common practice among bike-share operators of requiring users to sign waivers before they hop on a share bike.
“It implicates bikes and it lumps in bike share with scooter share. It takes away the ability to require a waiver from the rider. That’s really unfair to nonprofit bike-share operators,” Lommele said. “What scooters do should be specific to their industry and to their share operations, and not rope in bike share.”
In January, a Florida state senator introduced SB 542, which Lommele says lumps “motorized bicycles” in the same category as “micromobility devices” for the purpose of regulating electric scooter-share systems.
“We want them to remove ‘motorized bicycles’ from that definition to avoid any negative consequences for electric-bike-share operators in the state,” Lommele said.
In Tennessee, HB 1220 would establish requirements for electric scooters that mirror those for e-bikes, according to a legislative analysis.
Randy Neufeld, director of the SRAM Cycling Fund, believes e-scooters and similar light electric vehicles present a long-term threat to the bike industry.
“I think there is an existential crisis for the industry as to who we are,” he said.
It’s a tricky argument, because Neufeld acknowledges that scooters and other LEVs are much better for cities than cars. But he argues that they aren’t as beneficial for society as the human-powered activities of walking or riding a bike or e-bike.
“If, policywise, these light, low-speed vehicles occupy the bicycle ‘space’ — no helmet, no insurance, no license, you can park them anywhere — then they become a competitor to our industry,” Neufeld said. “It’s not that they’re bad things, but if they’re easier and cheaper and more available then it’s difficult for us to compete.”
The threat to e-bikes is particularly worrisome, he said, because e-bikes are key to the bicycle industry’s future profitability and growth.
“The light low-speed vehicles are likely to get cheaper and cheaper. We could be having a $2,000 e-bike competing with a $200 light low-speed electric vehicle,” he said.
The North American BikeShare Association, which despite its name now represents shared scooter and other “micromobility” devices as well as the bike-share industry, argues that bike-share and scooter-sharing systems should be treated separately.
In a policy statement, NABSA says bike lanes and other protected cycling infrastructure are the “most sensible” places for electric scooters. But the organization also says that “bicycles, electric bicycles and electric scooters are different products and should be regulated differently as appropriate. In particular, NABSA supports language that defines electric scooters independently of regulations regarding bicycles and electric bicycles.”
When comes to lobbying against these bills, the bike industry has another problem: The booming scooter industry has far deeper pockets.
“These are massive, multibillion-dollar operations, heavily backed by venture capital, and they’re aggressively seeking market share,” PFB’s Lommele said. “It’s just a different environment than bikes and e-bikes.”
Lyft, the ride-share company, owns Motivate, the largest operator of bike-share systems in the United States, and also operates a network of dockless scooters. It was anticipated to be valued at more than $20 billion in its IPO, which was expected to happen before the end of March.
Lime and Bird, two other big scooter-share firms, are each worth about $2 billion. Uber, the big kahuna of ride-sharing firms, is an investor in Lime and owns e-bike-share provider Jump Bikes, which recently debuted scooter services in several cities.

Andy Chen Weixing, the founder of Kuaidi Dache, was pushed out of China’s ride-hailing market in 2015. The company merged with a competitor ending in a price war with a more extensive service provider called Didi Chuxing.
However, Didi Chuxing is currently struggling with bad publicity as a second passenger was killed in three months. The company chalked these deaths up to a lack of oversight because of its quick expansion. Weixing decided to re-enter the marketplace to take market share from Didi Chuxing.
The app VV Go hopes to improve the income of drivers as well as passenger safety by leveraging the power of blockchain technology.
Blockchain Making Rideshare Safer
The blockchain based ride sharing platform will distribute informationbetween drivers and riders within the network. To ensure safety, the entire network will be informed in the case of a passenger sending out a distress call. This will allow other drivers or police officers to respond quickly.

The inability to reach help was an issue in the death of a rideshare customer earlier this year.
While the victim sent out a distress call, the company did not share trip details because of privacy concerns.
Now Didi Chuxing is developing a system whereby the police can be connected more efficiently with the details of their customers.


Transparency and access


Blockchain technology will allow greater transparency and access to records of passengers and drivers in a ride-sharing service. It also lets authorities generate a full audit of transaction history. This would presumably allow the police to intervene in case of a security issue.
Weixing  is creating his ride share on blockchain company through a non-profit called VV Share. This company will run a public blockchain network which will form the basis of building a shared economy in China.
Putting Blockchain into Action
VV Go will have a similar utility to Uber, Lyft, and Didi. But VV Go uses algorithms to send out orders in a way which works best for riders and drivers. VV Share will give out tokens for use on VV Go as well as other on-demand serviceswhich are currently in development by the company. VV Share will create 100 billion VVS tokens. VV Share’s team and advisors will maintain about 80 percent of them.
Chen believes that giving riders and drivers control and stake over their blockchain, maintaining security will be the business of the network as a whole. At this moment, it is unclear how VV Share will disperse the VVS tokens to people on the network.
Power to the People
However, this comes at a time when the Chinese government is cracking down on the burgeoning blockchain space. Beijing is looking to bring blockchain into areas of public record as well as cybersecurity. But, it does not want the retail space to become involved with blockchain technology for fear of opening the country up to fraud schemes. However, Weixing is hoping that working with the government; he will be able to bring blockchain technology to ride-hailing services.

The rise of car sharing could slash property prices with inner-city buyers increasingly happy to forgo a parking space for other transport alternatives.
With parking becoming less crucial to buyers, developers are increasingly doing away with a car spot for every apartment and turning to car share.
At Central Park — one of Sydney’s biggest redevelopments in the past decade — about 700 residents, or one in 10, are car-share members utilising about 50 spaces in GoGet SuperPods at the One Central Park and Duo buildings.
With the area’s last residents moving in to the neighbouring Wonderland building, another SuperPod — 10 or more car-share spots — is due to open.
The Chippendale development delivered 0.6 car spaces per apartment, but it would be even fewer now if construction was to start again, said Central Park project director Mick Caddey, from Frasers Property Australia.
“Car share … was only in its infancy of development [when we started],” Mr Caddey said. “[We have a] pretty low car ratio and if I was developing today I might even squeeze that down further. [Generally] now, our studios and a very large proportion of one-bedroom apartments would not have a car space.”
Central Park is one of about 100 developments nationally which has GoGet parking, with about 9 per cent – 280 – of their 3000 vehicles in developments. They had 120 vehicles across 50 developments less than two years ago.
About 140,000 people are now members of GoGet and more than 60,000 people are members of Car Next Door.
“Sydney is where we are really seeing the big push,” said Chris Vanneste, head of locations and partnerships at GoGet. “[But] we’re starting to see a really big start up in Brisbane … and in Melbourne we have them in a lot of developments, but at a smaller scale.”
Chippendale has the highest proportion of GoGet users in the country, with some Central Park residents reportedly selling their cars or deciding not to buy one in order to car share. While vehicle numbers have increased with the population in recent years, there’s been an overall decline in the percentage of car owners.
“[In the early days] we got a lot of pushback from the sales team that they couldn’t sell apartments without parking spaces, [then they realised] as long as you provide an alternate service it works,” Mr Vanneste said.
“We’re starting to have developers talk to us now about car-share only developments … because it’s such a huge cost [to provide basement parking].”
Mr Caddey said an underground parking space could add $50,000 to the cost of an apartment, a substantial increase particularly for studio and one-bedroom apartments. The extra cost, combined with the purchase and running costs of a car, equated to a lot of public transport, ride-share and car-share trips, he added.
However stripping back parking in new developments was a balancing act, Mr Caddey said. While there was little resistance at Central Park, it was a different story in lower density areas with less public transport options and amenity.
It is an issue inner-west mayor Darcy Byrne is all too familiar with.
“You’ve got two competing imperatives, if you reduce requirements for parking in new development you increase affordability of housing significantly … on the other hand if you build new developments and there is not either parking capacity or good public transport, it creates chaos in public streets,” Cr Byrne said.
The inner west council has more than 80 allocated car-share spots and has partnered with GoGet to roll out up to 20 more as part of a pilot program integrating car share with the light rail. It’s one of almost 50 councils GoGet has partnered with and is neck and neck with Melbourne City Council for the highest number of spots after the City of Sydney.
“There is significant demand for first and last-mile journey [options] and, given our public transport system is generally not very well integrated, it seems like a good opportunity,” Cr Byrne said.
However it had to be balanced with concerns raised by the community about dedicated car-sharing spaces resulting in a loss of parking for residents, he said.
“The entire time I’ve been in local government, parking has always been close to the number one issue, but we’re never going to get big enough streets for everyone to have a car … as the population starts to increase, we have to look at innovative alternatives,” Cr Byrne said.
“We do need to transition aways from dependence on private vehicles. [But] I don’t think we’re going to see private car ownership disappear anytime soon … it will continue to be a balancing act.”
Mr Vanneste said he would like to see the pilot program, if successful, rolled out statewide so people could use public transport for most of their journey and a car for the last leg if needed.
While he initially saw car share as an inner-city service, Mr Vanneste said there was more demand than expected in areas like Parramatta, Liverpool and Sydney Olympic Park. He noted the company would continue to expand across the city, focusing on transport corridors.

Washington’s regional transit system is planning a $1 million, one-year pilot program to subsidize taxi and ride-sharing trips for Metro users between midnight and 4 a.m. when the subway system is closed.
Business leaders in Montgomery County say the service could help restaurants and other late-night workers.
Metrorail has been closing at 11:30 p.m. on weeknights and 1 a.m. on weekends for required track repairs and system maintenance and late-night bus service is limited.
“We have almost 200 restaurants in Bethesda, and many of them stay open past midnight,” said Ginanne Italiano, president and CEO of the Greater Bethesda Chamber of Commerce, who supports more options for employees who work late hours and customers of bars and restaurants. “And it’s not just restaurants, but also office workers like cleaning folks and others who do work late.”
Italiano said she recognizes that Metro needs to perform nighttime maintenance and that it isn’t realistic to expect the system to do so while returning to late-night hours.
“Metro is doing what they’re supposed to be doing … so we understood, but at the same time, it didn’t help our economy,” she said.
Similar concerns were heard voiced last month at a public forum in Silver Spring.
Stephanie Steele, who works for The Fillmore music venue and was the past chairwoman of the Greater Silver Spring Chamber of Commerce, Steele said 450 businesses in downtown Silver Spring rely on Metro.
“Simply said, Metro’s reduction of night time hours are reducing the nighttime economy,” she said.
Jane Redicker, the President and CEO of the Silver Spring Chamber, said she too had observed a suffering restaurant industry in the downtown area due to the early Metro closings.
“It’s an interesting proposal and an interesting way to help alleviate some of the challenges that some of the nighttime economy has faced with the early shutdowns,” she said of the ride-sharing idea.
Redicker said she has also spoken to a number of property owners who have had trouble attracting tenants due to the fact that Silver Spring is located on the often-delayed Red Line. She said she is looking forward to the service improvements Metro is implementing in the coming year, which includes ending turnbacks at Silver Spring and adding more trains during rush hours.
“We supported ending the turnbacks. That’ll be a big help,” she said.
Under the proposal released Wednesday, Metro would pay for the first $3 of each ride for 10 rides per week. Trips would need to take place within Metro’s service area.
Wednesday’s announcement came two weeks after the transit agency’s board voted to maintain the current early closing times of 11:30 p.m. on weeknights and 1 a.m. on weekends. The earlier closing times have been in place since 2016 to allow the transit system to perform nighttime maintianance.

Southeast Asia’s largest ride-hailer Grab will add public transport information to its platform as it moves a step closer to becoming a one-stop mobility app.
The new service called “Trip Planner” will integrate publicly available transport data as well as other real-time information from partner transport operators. It will be launched this week in Singapore, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur.
Trip Planner will allow users to view public transit routes, along with ride-hailing suggestions for the first and last mile of each journey, as well as alerts on delay and schedule changes for some transport options.
Initially, the new service will only display public transport information, but Grab plans to add a function to enable consumers to pay for the entire journey with once touch.
“Trip Planner is one of our first steps towards integrating Grab with public transport,” Ngiam Xinwei, head of marketplace and shared mobility at Grab, told Nikkei Asian Review in an interview, adding that Grab envisioned a future where all users had to do was “pay [for public transport] with the Grab app” and then put the phone in their pocket.
Grab is still to negotiate financial arrangements with public transport operators, and there are technical hurdles to overcome such as how users would ride on trains or buses without physical tickets.
Grab operates ride-hailing services in eight countries across Southeast Asia, and will start the Trip Planner in Singapore, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur because those cities have more developed public transport systems with easily accessible data.
The ride-hailing company has been testing Trip Planner in Jakarta since late February ahead of the launch of the Indonesian capital’s first MRT service in March. Jakarta’s MRT operator expects to attract users by tapping into Grab and other ride hailing services.
While Grab’s Trip Planner might be a boon for competing transport operators, Grab views this as being in line with its vision to help reduce congestion and push smart mobility. Trip Planner will be “a win-win for everybody involved, including the governments and us,” said Ngiam.

Uber was an unknown quantity when it arrived in New Zealand.
“Now it’s a verb, it’s a noun, everyone uses it and I think that that has been the evolution in terms of how it’s become integrated into people’s lives,” said Uber’s New Zealand boss Amanda Gilmore.
But Uber’s monopoly of the ride-sharing market is over – there is a new kid on the block.
Ola might be the underdog here in New Zealand, but it dominates the massive Indian market – its home base.
Brian Dewil is leading Ola’s drive into New Zealand.
He said the two founders, Bharvish Aggarwal and Ankit Bhati kept Ola in India, concentrating on securing it’s huge market share there. But in 2017 they “decided to venture out of the shores of India into international waters”.
Ola moved into Australia in 2017, the UK early 2018 and finally arrived here in November last year.
“We’ve done a lot of research into the market places and the ANZ region seemed like a good place for us to trial and to get Ola out of India,” said Dewil.
“And, particularly in New Zealand, we saw what could be argued as a monopoly in terms of where the ride-share was at with very little competition against the dominant incumbent. So, Ola being a challenger brand, familiar with that world was very keen to sort of come into New Zealand and offer a credible, safe, viable ride-share alternative.”
And they’ve come into market, as Dewil terms it, “aggressively”.
“We’ve got to get enough customers quick enough for our drivers to make a substantial living,” said Dewil, “We’ve invested very heavily into New Zealand. We’re not here to just sort of test the waters and play around.”
So, a full-scale battle has broken out for the hearts, minds and pockets of customers. And drivers.
Drivers are key. Without a critical mass of them in the right place at the right times the business model falls apart.
Ola’s strategy is to give drivers a bigger slice of the pie. The company takes a lower commission rate than Uber.
But Amanda Gilmore says driver loyalty is not all about how much drivers earn.
She explained that the ability to earn with Uber is really dependent upon time and day of the week, so Uber aims to empower drivers with information. If they know where the greatest earning opportunities are they can make the most of their time driving.
“I’ve been with Uber for almost 3 years and there’s still plenty of drivers that I run into every day that I met my first week and I don’t think that they would still be doing that if it wasn’t a compelling proposition for them,” she said.
Jimmy is one of around 8,000 Uber drivers in Auckland and reckons during the busy Christmas season, drivers can earn up to 1800 dollars a week before tax and expenses.
“But all other times they make about 1200, 1400 a week. So, after cutting all their expenses, at least everybody’s making $900 a week, which is equal to their 40 or 50 hours a week job.
And this is great, because the job also comes with flexibility.
“If I work full-time somewhere else then my wife need to stop the job or I have to end up sending my son to the childcare, where if we make another $400 extra, we might be ending up paying 2-3 hundred dollars to the childcare,” he said.
Jimmy is fairly clear about who will emerge as the winner between Uber and Ola.
“Maybe Uber will lose some jobs. But still they are the one who first started these ride-share apps, so whoever started it first, they are going to be number one, all the time.”
Jimmy’s confidence is one thing, but Uber’s not taking its head start for granted.
It’s aiming to stay number one by becoming an integral part of our urban transport systems.
Last year Uber acquired Jump electric scooters and plans to add them to it’s platform.
“In the next 12 months we’re really thinking about what are those other modes that we can bring in to market,” said Glimore, “What if you could get an electric scooter or even an electric bike or potentially you could see what buses are available and jump on a bus as well?”
Gilmore sees a future with lots of different ways of getting around so the consumer can choose a seamless experience that works best for them.
“That is really the North Star for us. Creating that whole experience in one place.”
“But we can also kind of incentivise people to take the modes that make the most sense for the city and the ecosystem. So we can try to get people onto public transport or potentially on to electric scooters and things like that,” she said.
And Auckland’s congested roads and stressed public transport has plenty of upside for Uber
“There is a ton of opportunity in first and last mile,” said Gilmore.
So, she said, instead of using overflowing Park ‘n Ride stations, people could ride-share to the bus and train stations. That might be a much more efficient solution than us having to invest in more Park ‘n Ride infrastructure.
Gilmore also thinks complementing the existing transport network could be a source of new customers for Uber.
“Potentially there are times of day buses are roaming around with really low utilisation. Is it more cost effective to do a share-ride in a smaller vehicle, like an Uber with four people. Or the opposite – is there times of day or areas where buses are at capacity and it doesn’t make sense to add another bus from a cost perspective but maybe we can get just a little added capacity from some pooled vehicles.”
She said Uber’s pooling technology has come a really long way and she’s keen to work with government on how we could bring that to New Zealand.
But is this enough to hold off Ola? Uber’s monopoly is gone and with it the idea that once you have scale you can raise prices and cash – big time.
Uber is no Google or Facebook, it faces serious competition and its battle with Ola means the riders are the winners.

Uber had planned to have as many 75,000 self-driving vehicles on its fleet in 2019, part of a broader plan to introduce a robo-taxi service in 13 American cities by 2022.
And the company was pumping money into the plan at an incredible rate, with documents tendered as part of a trade secret lawsuit brought by Google-backed rival Waymo revealing the ride-share service was spending US$20m a month on the prgram back in 2016, according to the TechCrunch website.
The report details internal modelling that shows, as of 2016, Uber predicted it driverless cars would become a profitable part to its business by 2018, with as many as 75,000 driverless vehicles on the road this year. That vision is yet to occur, of course, and Uber is now reportedly seeking a US$1b funding boost to supercharge its self-driving plans, according to reports in the Wall Street Journal.
For now, though, Uber’s driverless-car program remains in test mode, with a pilot program paused and then scaled back following a fatal accident with a pedestrian in Arizona last year.

It’s been less than a year since city leaders were freaking out about the proliferation of dock-less bike shares, which were clogging sidewalks and ending up in trees and vacant lots. Despite some consternation about how the city might step in and regulate the bike shares, the whole ordeal was resolved with one simple solution: the scooter. Almost overnight, scooters bumped bike share off the streets and the hand-wringing about bike tangles was over.
Unlike the bikes, it doesn’t look like those electric scooters are a passing fad. According to a recent report by the National Association of City Transportation Officials, during the first full year after scooters first hit the streets of American cities, 38 million rides were taken. Incredibly, scooter companies are scaling faster than any new transportation innovation, including ride-share, according to this Axios analysis.
Since it seems like scooters are here to stay, it makes sense to begin to talk about regulations.
Like the bikes, there are some lingering questions about how scooters fit into Dallas’ current mobility picture. Electric scooters sometimes clog up sidewalks; street infrastructure supporting their usage is insufficient; and there have been many questions about safety and liability. So how will cities regulate their use in a way that doesn’t stifle their success?
An op-ed on Streetsblog reports that several cities have started to search for answers:

Cities have begun regulating these rapidly proliferating vehicles in a variety of ways, including imposing caps on the number of scooters allowed by each operator, speed limits, designated parking zones, and permit systems that include fees and taxes. In this vein, San Francisco stands out among its peers for the deliberate process it has taken to legalize scooter sharing. After demanding that all the scooters dropped on the street without permission be removed, the city created a permit system and awarded two of them, to Skip and Scoot. Other cities have avoided this altogether by simply banning dockless scooters (or refusing to update their regulations to allow them).

Banning scooters altogether seems like an obvious short-sighted option, given how popular they have proven to be and how valuable a role they can play in solving the so-called “last mile” public transit problem. Unsurprisingly, no one has figured out the right mix of rules and regulations yet. But that’s a good thing. What is instead happening is a series of city-by-city experiments.
 Santa Monica, for example, has designated public rights of way for bike and scooter parking. Santa Cruz has a hybrid model that permits scooters to be parked at docking stations and bike racks. San Francisco tried reducing sidewalk clutter by requiring that all scooters have locking mechanisms, and it seems to be working. The Bay City also piloted a program that allows low-income residents a break on scooter rental prices.
The advantage for Dallas is that it can sit back and watch all these cities’ experiments and determine which mix of new laws will work better here. That said, California also presents another lesson for Texas. Even as California cities are fine tuning their approach to scooter regulation, the state legislature has stepped in with a blanket bill that may frustrate many of these efforts.
Streetsblog goes into the details of the proposed state law, but the lesson for Texas is simple. Any scooter regulation should be generated by a city’s individual experience with the new technology, allowing ideas to be generated by local feedback and data-driven analysis.
Patience and local discretion. That may seem like an obvious policy disposition. But given the Texas legislatures recent penchant for stepping on cities’ toes, it is one worth repeating.

The streets of Dubai are abuzz with ride-hailing and -sharing platforms, and industry momentum around delivering future mobility, in line with the requirements of smart cities, has intensified after HE Sultan Al Mansouri, the UAE’s Minister of Economy, approved American giant Uber’s pending acquisition of local car-hailing app Careem in a $3.1bn (AED11.4bn) transaction earlier this month. 
Despite the odd traffic jam, I thoroughly enjoy driving and the nitty-gritty of car-ownership. However, the advancements made in the mobility sector over the last few days alone have made me wonder how much longer I will need to own a car for.
For instance, earlier this month, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) signed a memorandum of understanding with personal rapid transit developer Skytran to introduce suspended transport systems in the city. These small-sized units have a cruising speed of 160kmph, and are typically supported 20-30ft above-ground, with the system said to have the capacity of transporting more people than a six-lane highway.

Mobility may once have been a buzzword in the global design and construction sectors, but the UAE’s advancements are proving that smart cities are no longer a theoretical concept and can, indeed, be translated into economic, environmental, and social benefits in the real world.

The RTA’s and Skytran’s announcement comes at a time when, led by the UAE, hyperloop construction is becoming a reality around the world. In October 2018, it was confirmed that construction on the world’s first commercial hyperloop system – located in UAE capital Abu Dhabi – would begin in Q3 2019, with Dar Al-Handasah leading the project design of Hyperloop Transportation Technologies’ (Hyperloop TT) project.
In Dubai, DP World Cargospeed was formed in April 2018 with the aim of developing rapid-transit systems using Virgin Hyperloop One’s magnetic levitation technology to deliver goods, as well as create links between road, rail, and air transport networks.
Not too far from DP World’s head office in Jafza, construction is steadily progressing on the extension of Dubai Metro’s Red Line, called Route 2020, which links the busy passenger transport network to the Expo 2020 Dubai site.
Route 2020 spans 15km from Nakheel Harbour and Tower Station to the World Expo’s site, and comprises 11.8km of elevated and 3.2km of underground track. Rail track work for Route 2020, according to RTA’s announcement in March 2019, was 80% complete, while stations for the development were 50-60% complete.
Mobility may once have been a buzzword in the global design and construction sectors, but the UAE’s advancements are proving that smart cities are no longer a theoretical concept and can, indeed, be translated into economic, environmental, and social benefits in the real world. Dubai’s ambition to become one of the world’s smartest and greenest cities shows no signs of slowing down – if anything, it’s journey has only just begun.

Starting Wednesday morning, residents in Maryland’s largest county will have a new, low-cost public transportation option available to them — the D.C. region’s first on-demand public transit service.
At 10 a.m., the Montgomery County Department of Transportation will launch a pilot program for the new Ride On Flex bus service. Ride On Flex will run on-demand buses between designated areas in Montgomery County, specifically the Rockville and the Glenmont/Wheaton areas, according to the Montgomery County Council.
The Rockville service runs Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., while the Glenmont/Wheaton zone runs from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 3:30 p.m. to 7 p.m.



Buses are called using the Ride On Flex app, which is available for free for Apple and Android devices. During the pilot program, there will be a standard fare policy that will guarantee that riders will not pay more than $2 per ride. Riders can pay cash, use SmarTrip cards or bus passes.
After a rider requests service, he’s given an estimated time for pick up and drop off and is given a pickup location.
The service will connect residents with transit hubs, commercial centers and public services.
“The Flex service holds tremendous promise not only for taking cars off our roads, but also improving equity for residents who need an affordable solution for getting around quickly,” Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich said.
Ride On Flex buses differ from the county’s larger Ride On buses. The smaller buses will carry up to 11 passengers, are wheelchair accessible and offer free WiFi.
“In Glenmont/Wheaton, we hope to see residents using Flex to fill first mile/last mile gaps in their daily commute,” county transportation director Al Roshdieh said. “In Rockville, the service lends itself more toward daytime errands and trips.”
The Ride On Flex app was developed in partnership with ride-share company Via.
“This technology makes for quick and efficient shared trips without lengthy detours, or inconvenient fixed routes and schedules,” said Daniel Ramot, CEO and co-founder of Via.
During the pilot program, the transportation department will monitor trip data and user feedback to judge how the service is performing.
Area transportation officials will watch to see what can be learned from the new service.

INSHUR and Uber have partnered to offer a range of insurance services to drivers who use the Uber app.  The fully digital insurance service is one of the first of its kind.
INSHUR uses information about average trips, location and driver ratings in near real-time.  The data is then used to calculate risks and pricing, and reward safe driving with cheaper policies.
Traditionally, it has not been an easy process for drivers to purchase specialist PHV insurance. A recent survey found over half of drivers waited a day or more for their policy and 11% waited for one or two weeks*.  Drivers have to print forms, call or visit a broker’s office – all of which keep them from driving and costs money.
The INSHUR app allows drivers to log in using their Uber ID, scan their licences, select a type of cover and pay for a policy in the app.  This process takes only three minutes and drivers can make changes 24/7 and don’t need to wait for the broker to open.
The partnership also aims to reduce insurance fraud. INSHUR is the only 100% mobile PHV insurance provider in the UK meaning it is able to provide real-time digital checks without the need for manual intervention.  For example, INSHUR fraud protection is built into the application process, with automated driver validation, such as scans of both Driving Licence and Private Hire Licences.
Insurance documents are also automatically uploaded to the Uber platform as soon as a driver is covered and notifications are automatically sent if the driver is no longer insured.
Fred Jones, Director, Uber London Limited, said:
“Safety is at the heart of everything we do and motor insurance is at the heart of private hire safety. We have introduced many new safety features in the app and improved our processes over the past 18 months. However, we won’t stop there because when it comes to safety on our platform, our work is never done.”
David Daiches, Co-founder, INSHUR, said:
“We have built a data-driven technology platform, secured insurance capacity with a trusted global insurer and are scaling our business in New York and the UK.  The relationship with Uber further extends our focus on technology, data and real-time usage based risk assessment. The aim will be to reward the safe and highest rated professional drivers, this is a great thing for everyone.”

The race for a completely autonomous commercial taxi services has been heating up and a Chinese startup called WeRide is the latest player in it. If the latest announcement by the firm holds true, it will be launching its self-driven taxi services on the roads of China by July this year.
WeRide has chosen Guangzhou and Anqing as the two regions to initiate the service. Being the first one to do so in the country, the launch of the service will put it directly in competition with the likes of Uber and Waymo.
Though it will be lagging from the two competitors initially, simply due to the lack of data collected over a period of autonomous rides, WeRide won’t exactly be starting from scratch. The company has been conducting test rides of its autonomous taxi services since a year now with partners like Guangzhou Automobile Group and hence already has around 50 autonomous vehicles around the country.

The plan is to double the number of vehicles by the end of 2019. This will further be scaled to 500 by the end of next year and the proposed vehicle for the same would be Nissan’s electric passenger car, the Nissan Leaf.
WeRide will be starting with human drivers present in the taxis first, eventually phasing them out over a period of 2 years, once the 5G network is rolled out. The company will be introducing a smartphone app to book these cabs, which will then be able to carry the passengers to popular places in the region like the shopping malls. Prices will be similar to those of traditional taxi services as per the government regulations and the payments will be made digitally through apps and credit cards.
Interestingly, it has taken the company just two years to reach this stage. Founded by a team of 20 tech industry veterans in Silicon Valley, the startup moved its headquarters to China in late 2017 to focus more on the Chinese market. Reason? Chinese government has installed ample support systems for such developments, letting such autonomous vehicles drive almost anywhere at lower costs. This also results in more data collection for the company.
And that is why WeRide President Lu Qing is confident that they will beat Waymo to the race in a matter of around 6 months.
As for the technology used, WeRide is focusing on ‘level four’ autonomous driving, meaning that the car will only need a human driver in certain scenarios, such as heavy rains. Backing this up is surveillance system by SenseTime and GPU of Nvidia, one of its investors. The firm uses its own data center and has over 200 of its employees processing the collected data in Anqing.
WeRide chief believes that the firm is way ahead in the race than the rest of the Chinese players, simply because of the Silicon Valley workforce that they have. If this continues with the advancement of the firm in the autonomous ride sharing, it could very well be on its way for the long haul in a market that is expected to be the world’s largest for autonomous vehicles.
What would also help WeRide have an edge over its global counterparts is the leniency of Chinese government on the testing and practice of such autonomous vehicles, in contrast with the strict legislation in place in other countries like the US.

A new ridesharing program set up by the Washington, D.C., Department of Public Works (DPW) aims to reduce the number of cars on the congested roads of the nation’s capital and the amount of toxic emissions coming from those vehicles. But the resulting data also could give officials additional insights.
Under an agreement with Via Transportation, announced last month, D.C. government employees can book rides for official business through the Via app. To use it, agencies opt into Via Vehicles on Demand. The company receives a list of agency employees and sets up accounts under a corporate account. Employees download the app to their smartphones and log in with a unique promo code to book rides for work purposes such as meetings. At the end of each month, Via invoices DPW for all the rides taken, and the department passes on those bills to the agencies.
Like other popular services such as Uber and Lyft, after a rider books a ride, the Via app finds and sends the closest driver to a designated location within a block of the passenger. Via can be used for shared and individual rides.
So far, 10 agencies have the service up and running, and two more have requested enrollment. The Office of Strategic Planning and Performance Management (SPPM), DPW’s data team, has been leading the Vehicles on Demand effort.
“Together with Via team, SPPM collects and analyzes program data including ridership numbers, agency participation, cost, quality of service, trip length, etc.,” DPW Director Chris Geldart wrote in an email to GCN. “The live data insights are created in various dashboards and used by our team to increase agency participation, ridership and ensure high quality of service (e.g., short wait times, driver availability in rush hours).”
Via handles data privacy and security, Geldart added. Users are authenticated, authorized and audited, and all access is verified at the packet level and logged for audit, compliance and analysis.
“Via’s databases and backend systems are distributed among the three different ‘availability zones,’ which form Amazon Web Services’ US-East-1 region in Virginia,” Geldart said. “Via’s systems are designed to handle a complete failing of two out of the three zones.” Additionally, the company has a disaster recovery plan in that its databases are backed up to Amazon’s Simple Storage Service in an encrypted format.
Besides reducing traffic and carbon emissions, DPW is also seeing cost savings from the program. A major reason for this is the company already had a presence in D.C., so the partnership makes use of existing Via drivers, said Alex Lavoie, Via’s U.S. general manager.
Via Shared — think carpool — costs 56 cents per mile, Via Private is $1.06 per mile and a taxi is $2.16 per mile. The service is also cheaper than using agency-leased or -owned vehicles through a fleet share system, which works like Zipcar’s car-sharing business model, Geldart said.
“This program uses an already existing infrastructure to transport employees, thus minimizing the need for D.C. government vehicles, which means there is no maintenance, fuel or acquisition costs,” he added.
Other benefits DPW either sees or expects include fewer parking infractions and more transportation options for work-related activities.
“Our whole system is built with the idea that you can build the technology to efficiently group people together and route them if they’re headed to destinations in the same direction,” Lavoie said. “You can create an ecosystem that works for the riders of the vehicle, the drivers of the vehicle and also the city and residents of the city in which you’re operating by taking vehicles off the road, making sure rides are efficient and aren’t going to the most congested parts of the city.”
The partnership follows a pilot test of a ridesharing program that DPW and the D.C. Department of For-Hire Vehicles conducted with local taxicab companies from June 2017 to April 2018. In that time, more than 1,000 employees at 27 agencies took 2,100-plus rides. The impetus for that test run was finding cost-effective strategies for transporting District employees without adding to the 3,000 vehicles DPW maintains and fuels.
DPW’s partnership with Via is expected to result in about a 20% savings from the resulting per-mile rate of the pilot.

Global  Car Sharing Market is set to grow from its current market value of more than $1.5 billion to over $11 billion by 2024; according to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc.   
Increasing initiatives by the government to increase the usage of these services are expected to be one of the major factors driving the car sharing market growth. In July 2017, the ministry of transport of China drafted a policy to provide incentives to the users of these services, such as preferential parking slots & rates. Increasing government support is encouraging the implementation of these services with the traditional transportation modes. For instance, the local public transport operator in Brussels, STIB has partnered with Cambio CarSharing to facilitate the integration of these services with public transportation, thus positively impacting the car sharing market in the country.
Car sharing market is projected to witness growth due to the benefits experienced by the users such as reduction in costs incurred including the purchase of vehicles, parking, insurance, fuel, maintenance, etc. The users can avoid the fixed costs of ownership by accessing the vehicles on the pay-per-use basis. Furthermore, the environmental benefits due to traffic congestion are attracting customers to these services. In March 2014, Paris imposed a partial vehicle ban due to persistent air pollution above the stipulated European standards. During this time, the city has granted access to only car sharing and public transport vehicles.

 
Increasing competition from other mobility services, such as ride-hailing, and car rental, are expected to challenge the car sharing market during the forecast timespan. The perceived benefits of these models such as more reduction in traffic and pollution are encouraging the consumers to use these services often. Furthermore, the vendors in the industry are increasingly providing low-cost ride-sharing services, threatening the car sharing market growth.
Car sharing market in business applications is expected to witness growth, due to advantages such as flexibility for employees and reduction in fleet management costs. These services allow employees of the organization access to a large fleet of vehicles and flexibility of booking vehicles as & when needed. These services allow the fleet managers to streamline fleet operations and make an optimal use of vehicles. Furthermore, these services allow the organizations to save more by reducing total cost of mobility by about 30%.
UK Car Sharing Market size, by model, 2017 & 2024 (USD Million)

 
Europe car sharing market is expected to witness a significant growth due to the increasing awareness regarding these services among people and increasing government support. Under Initiativa Car Sharing, the government of Italy provides an extensive support to the players in the industry including incentives for drivers such as free parking in city centers and access to low emission zones. London Municipality, in association with the Transport for London (TfL), has introduced Car Clubs Strategy to support local clubs to penetrate the industry. The local authorities actively promote the use of these services and their benefits to the consumers.
Some of the key vendors in the car sharing market are Car2Go, Autolib, Cambio CarSharing, Orix Corporation, Lyft, Inc., and Zipcar, Inc. These companies are constantly devising strategies such as lowering fares and offering promotional discounts to remain competitive in the industry. Furthermore, the industry is characterized by strong competition among both global and regional players.

China’s January light vehicle numbers are in — and they are not pretty.
(Except for electric cars. But more on that in a minute).
Overall light vehicle sales declined a stunning 18 percent year-on-year.
January 2018: 2,395,000
January 2019: 2,010,000
That’s a fall of nearly 400,000 units. If we take $22,000 as the average new vehicle transaction price, we are talking about a revenue shortfall of $880 million. In a single month.
This is China’s 7th straight down month, something the Post-Mao generation has never seen. Even at GM and its mighty partner, SAIC, sales declined 11 percent in January.
Why the sustained market weakness? Three factors:
1. Confidence: Chinese consumer confidence has been shaken by the cloud of uncertainty hanging over trade and investment relations with the United States. As the saying goes, “There is no one on earth more audacious than a Chinese when times are good. And there is no one under the heavens more cautious than a Chinese once the weather turns.”
2. P2P Lending Crackdown. At its peak, some 2,000 informal companies were channeling loans from wealthy coastal Chinese to aspiring middle class families living in inland cities. Then came a major regulatory crackdown last summer.
3. Mobility Choices. Increasing numbers of Chinese are opting for mobility as a service over car ownership. Some 550 million Chinese took 10 billion rides with Didi last year, according to company spokespeople. (That compares to 100 million users and 5 billion rides for Uber globally in 2018).
Also firing demand for mobility: Urban residents are growing tired of the costs of car ownership, including taxes, ever-increasing parking fees and insurance.
Fuel – at $4.40 per gallon – is also not cheap.
Electric Momentum
What about electric vehicles? Well, they continue to buck the market trend in a big way. Chinese automakers delivered 98,000 EVs and plug-in hybrids in January, up 120 percent from the January 2018 level.
Driving EV demand: Quotas, mandates, subsidies, tax breaks and road access policies. Also, there is rising consumer acceptance as better EV models come to market and charging stations grow nationwide.
So, if you’re sitting in Detroit or Stuttgart or Paris or Tokyo you might be asking yourself: How will the decline in Chinese car demand change my 2018 bonus, er, I mean, my company’s prospects?
German luxury: Still smiling. Mercedes, BMW and Audi achieved record sales. (The wealthy, China will always have them).
Japanese: Think spectrum. Toyota strong. Honda steady. Nissan wobbly. Mazda shaky. Suzuki already out of the game.
Americans: Hurt locker. Ford and FCA sales down more than 30%. GM off, too, but less sharply.
French. Carnage. Peugeot sales sliding 50% since 2016. Never mind a bonus. Start thinking job security.
Take: Chinese EV makers are beginning to see opportunity (and potential profits) at higher price points. Beijing Automotive’s Arcfox brand is designed to be the company’s equivalent to the Mini brand: A premium offering in a small package.
>> CATL/Honda. China’s largest EV battery maker, CATL, and Honda are teaming up on battery development.
Take: Only a few years ago, Chinese-Japanese cooperation on electrics was unthinkable. In a rivalry colored by geopolitics, China pushed electrics while Japan endorsed fuel cells. Now, there is greater flexibility on both sides.
>> Aiways. Another Chinese electric SUV is on this way to market. This time the target is Europe. The product: Aiways U5, with more than 280 miles of range.
Take: There seems to be at least one Chinese EV in all 26 Chinese provinces. The U5 is already in production at a plant in land-locked Jiangxi Province, southern China. Think Arkansas.
AUTONOMOUS
>> TuSimple. Autonomous vehicle start-up for trucks steps into unicorn status with $95 million in Series D funding, led by the Sina Corporation, owners of Weibo, the twitter of China.
Take: TuSimple, with operations in San Diego and Tucson, is one of several Chinese auto-tech firms with dual operations in China and the United States. Others include Pony.ai, Roadstar, WeRide and Baidu.
 
Quadrobot/Detroit. This last-mile delivery firm aims to develop products in Detroit then manufacture and sell in China.
Take: China is proving to be a fertile ground for autonomous driving tech.
National and local governments are paving the way into ports, airports and postal delivery services.
Remember: China is home to more than 160 cities with a population of over 1 million residents. Each city has a transportation budget.
RIDE-HAILING
>> Didi/Chile: Didi is entering Chile, in many ways South America’s most progressive economy and home to 18 million.
Take: Uber, watch your bottom flank. Didi is already well-ensconced in Brazil, after acquiring 99, a local company, in 2017. Now Didi is aiming to compete in Chile, Peru and Columbia.
NEW DEALS
>> Amazon/Automotive. Amazon invested $700 million last week in Rivian, the Michigan-based EV pickup and SUV maker. The deal comes just a week after Amazon’s “significant investment” in Aurora, the autonomous-vehicle startup.
Take: An internet giant investing in automakers? Shades of Tencent’s 2017 investments in NIO and Tesla.
>> Crunched. Apart from the TuSimple deal, Chinese investment into the United States is down significantly. Look at these Chinese-Investments-into-the-US numbers from the respected Rhodium Group:
2016: $46 billion
2017: $29 billion
2018: $4.8 billion
This does not mean business activity is grounding to a halt because the investment numbers do not count re-investments from current operations. Nor can they capture special deals like loans or licensing agreements designed to work around direct investment controls.
Nonetheless, investors are mostly holding their powder until trade and investment tensions ease.

The carsharing market generated a revenue of $5,571.2 million in 2018 and is estimated to progress at a CAGR of 11.0% during the forecast period (2019–2025), owing to advancements in technology, which are helping make the access to shared mobility services easy. The growing demand for convenient and cost-effective mobility services, coupled with government policies encouraging the use of carsharing programs, is the key factor driving the growth of the market. In simple terms, carsharing is a short–term rental service offered to customers at a certain charge. 
Based on car type, the global carsharing market is categorized into luxury, executive, and economy cars. Among these, in 2018, in terms of volume, the economy category held the largest share in the market. This is attributed to the high fuel economy of these cars, which stimulates their demand for carsharing services. Furthermore, the rising gasoline prices and increasing environmental concerns are expected to push the demand for these cars across the globe in the coming years, as these cause less impact on the environment and are cost-effective. 
Further, on the basis of fuel type, the global carsharing market is bifurcated into fuel-based and electric cars. Of these, in terms of volume, fuel-based cars dominated the market in the historical period (2014–2018) and are further projected to continue leading it with more than 95.0% share in 2025. However, growing initiatives toward vehicle electrification and environment protection are predicted to result in decreased gasoline usage during the forecast period. In addition, owing to low maintenance cost, electric cars are anticipated to observe increased adoption in the market for carsharing.
Carsharing services are extremely useful for the general public, especially for daily commuters, as without owning and maintaining cars, they can reach their destination. For users, these services are available day and night throughout the year, allowing them to use a car from anywhere, anytime. Besides, with the help of the carsharing company’s mobile app, commuters can directly avail the services and easily rent the car of their choice. The apps offer the necessary details and every assistance to users, so that they have a good commuting experience. Hence, mobile apps, providing easy access to cars as well as all the information related to the service, are taking the carsharing market ahead. 
Furthermore, carsharing helps save the expenditure on owned cars, fuel, maintenance, parking, and insurance. Carsharing services require users to pay only on the basis of the time and distance the car is being driven for, along with an initial registration cost. Also, other expenses, such as those for maintenance, insurance and fuel, are borne by the carsharing service providers. Due to benefits associated with sharing services, such as cost-efficiency and easy availability, the global carsharing market is expected to grow. 
Hence, with the increasing inclination of people toward convenient mobility services, the global market for carsharing is witnessing a boost.

Bike-sharing companies are raising their rates as they face decreasing profit margins, but experts said the industry is at present the best way to solve the last-mile problem for commuters.
Industry insiders said that the subsidy tactic in the bike-sharing industry has come to an end. In order to survive, bike-sharing enterprises have moved to raise their rates and the industry is stepping into a new phase of development.
Starting in April, many bike-sharing companies raised their rates, with variations depending on regions. For example, in Beijing, Mobike and BlueGogo now charge 1 yuan (14 cents) for the first 15 minutes, and 0.5 yuan for each extra 15 minutes. The previous rate was 1 yuan per 30 minutes. Hellobike doubled its rate from 0.5 yuan to 1 yuan per 15 minutes.
Shared bikes have strong demand in major Chinese cities and remain the best solution for the last-mile problem in commuting, Liu Xingliang, director of the Data Center of China Internet (DCCI), told the Global Times on Monday. “Raising rates is a direct way to gain profits and survive,” he added.
Shares bikes are used about 10 million times per day, said Minister of Transport Li Xiaopeng at a press event in February.
According to iiMedia Research, the number of bike-sharing users in China reached 235 million in 2018 and will increase to 259 million in 2019.
There were 77 shared bike companies and 23 million shared bikes as of February 2018, according to official data. The majority of them have gone bust.
“People will use shared bikes despite the higher rates,” Liu said. “There’s no substitute and I see great potential in the industry.”
I use shared bikes at least four times a week to travel back and forth between the subway station and my house. I use Mobike and the rate hike had no impact on me. I will still use it as often,” Jazzmin, a British teacher at an international school in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday.
Another user surnamed Wu said that he is a monthly card subscriber and is not influenced by the new billing policy. He will continue using shared bikes for short-distance commuting when other modes of transportation aren’t realistic.
The glory days of the bike-sharing industry ended last year after a boom in 2017 and the bubbles in the industry are deflating, said iiMedia Research.
“The old rates weren’t high enough for bike-sharing companies to make ends meet. But consumers got used to them, a result of cutthroat competition,” said Liu.
To regulate and develop the bike-sharing industry, governments have taken measures. 
Some cities have set a limit for the total number of shared bikes on the streets. Chengdu, Southwest China’s Sichuan Province reduced the number from 1.8 million to 750,000 last year in its main urban area and Shenzhen in South China’s Guangdong Province cut the number from 890,000 to about 600,000, according to media reports.
Beijing has set up pilot parking areas in the main urban area. Users who fail to park bikes inside these areas will be warned the first time and fined from the second time.
The Ministry of Transport and five other government departments in May released a guideline to regulate how bike-sharing providers handle users’ deposits. Those rules take effect from Saturday.

Lime and other dockless bike share companies are pivoting from bicycles to electric scooters.
Scooter services have outpaced bike share in demand.
Lime will quietly remove bikes from several cities this month.

In Mountain View, California, home of Google and Microsoft, dockless bike sharecompanies rise and fall in color-coded waves. Spin (orange) dropped out after a short pilot. China-based Ofo (yellow) left town due to financial difficulties. Now, Lime (green) plans to leave by mid-March.
Several cities have reported similar trends. In the space of a month, Lime bikes, which unlock via mobile app and charge riders by the minute, will disappear from the streets of San Mateo, California; Hartford, Connecticut; and an undisclosed number of other cities. In their place, the San Francisco-based startup will offer its popular electric scooter service. Some cities, like Seattle, will see their Lime bicycle fleets transition entirely to electric-assist bikes—while also undergoing a major e-scooter push.
“Lime communicated to us that it’s focusing on scooters now as opposed to bikes,” said Nate Baird, Mountain View’s transportation planner. “They essentially gave us a 30-day notice.”
Dockless bikes and e-scooters fall into the booming “micro-mobility” market, which also includes car sharing, ride hailing, and other shared transportation services. In 2018, the industry saw a flurry of acquisitions, fresh rounds of venture capital, and heated competition between startups.
Lime is only the latest company to embrace an industry-wide shift away from pedal-powered bikes and toward e-scooters. Spin quietly ended its bike share program in April 2018 after expanding into scooters the previous February. Ford bought Spin a few months later, becoming the first legacy carmaker to break into micro-mobility.
China-based startups Ofo and Mobike, meanwhile, pulled out of U.S. cities over the summer after an aggressive global expansion collided with local government efforts to tamp down on unregulated bikes.
Ride-sharing giant Lyft entered the market in 2018, launching e-scooter services in nine cities. It also bought Motivate, North America’s largest bike share operator, in November, acquiring its conventional, dock-based systems.
Lime, which shortened its name from “LimeBike” in August, said the focus on e-scooters is a matter of simple demand.
“Riders are voting with their feet,” a company spokesperson said. “They’ve demonstrated a penchant for Lime’s electric vehicles and shown scooters are no longer a novelty, but rather one more flexible link to the transit chain.”
One study by Populus, a data-management platform for shared mobility services, found that e-scooters had a 3.6 percent adoption rate in 2018 alone. (Docked bike share had a 13 percent adoption rate over eight years.) The report also found greater gender parity in e-scooter use than in bike share—a tempting prospect for cities looking to diversify ridership.
This consensus is trickling down to local officials eager for public data about which transportation services work best.


“A number of companies have told us that scooters are doing very well in terms of the number of rides per day,” said Baird, who is now evaluating 2018 ridership data to help choose a bike share operator, or e-scooter service, to replace Lime in Mountain View.


In Portland, Oregon, riders took more than 700,000 trips on about 2,000 e-scooters between last August and November, according to the Portland Bureau of Transportation. In the same period, riders only took about 134,000 bike share trips.
“I think companies are naturally following the money, and they’re getting more trips out of e-scooters,” said Chris Corrao, senior transit and transportation planner for Cupertino, California, not far from Mountain View. Cupertino is still figuring out what kind of dockless system it wants to adopt, and constant changes in the industry have made it difficult to pin one down.
“We’re disappointed to see more and more companies move away from bikes and into e-scooters,” Carrao said, adding that he while isn’t against scooters per se, he does have concerns about their sustainability. “We’re hearing the devices are only good for 1-3 months,” he said. (Lime would not confirm the average lifespan of its e-scooters, and multiple other scooter companies did not return requests for comment.)


For its part, Lime frames its role as providing the best alternative to car travel, even if that means prioritizing scooters over bikes.


“We strongly believe the best way for us to maximize the positive impacts of Lime in local communities is to demonstrate our agility and willingness to adjust based on patterns of preference, utilization, and needs,” a Lime spokesperson said.
Some cities have seen a public outcry against e-scooters for crowding sidewalks and littering streets. In Cincinnati, an urban design group spray painted designated parking areas for e-scooters to help deal with the problem.
Other critics have raised safety concerns. The Washington Post last fall reported an uptick in emergency room visits due to electric scooters, although the crash data on scooters versus other forms of transportation is still unclear. The CDC is now conducting its first study of e-scooters in Austin, Texas.


Lime, meanwhile, is growing at a dizzying pace. The 2-year-old startup this month launched a car-sharing service in Seattle called LimePod, which will compete with companies like car2go. Recently Lime hired its first chief financial officer with the goal of seeking additional private capital for expansion. (It already has a $2 billion valuation, and its latest round of investment totaled $310 million as of February.) Just this week, it partnered with Google Maps to show rental options directly on the app.


And last year, the ride-hailing giant Uber bought stock in Lime as part of a massive private funding round. (Uber also bought Jump, one of the few dockless bike share startups to still see growth with cycling. In October, Jump e-bike rentals outpaced Uber-hailed car trips in Jump’s service area in Sacramento, California.)
Lime said it will keep bike share services in some cities, but would not confirm how many would remain by mid-March. As for what the pivot toward scooters will mean for urban cyclists, planners are taking a wait-and-see approach.
“It’s been a learning experience,” Baird said. “Everyone knows the landscape is changing quickly… All we can do it speculate.”

 Frustrated Boston-area commuters driven crazy by gridlock say drastic steps need to be taken to free up traffic — including widening roads, opening ride-hail lots just outside the city and awarding days off for not driving in.
Boston is the seventh-most congested city in the nation and the Pioneer Institute wants to give $10,000 to whoever can solve the city’s chronic congestion. The Pioneer Institute’s 2019 Better Government Competition is centered on ideas to get commuters where they need to be quickly.
Motorists like Meredith Durell of Medford are already on the fast track for workable ideas: “Your health insurance could give you points back if you run or bike to get to work … or more vacation days if you commute by anything but your personal vehicle.”
Amelia Eisenhauer, a Berklee College student, said the answer lies in construction schedules around the city.
“Something that could fix the traffic problem would be more planning as far as construction goes. The close-downs are not strategic,” said Eisenhauer, who added that widening the roads and adding more lanes could also help drivers.
Those who enter the Better Government Competition are encouraged to consider obstacles like finance and management, permitting, freight and planning. Technology could also come into play through autonomous vehicles, data solutions, scheduling and bus-route redesign. Proposals should not only address congestion but public safety and cost efficiency.
Four runners-up with be awarded $1,000 each for their ideas.
According to the competition description, “State, local and federal governments invest hundreds of billions of dollars each year in transportation infrastructure, yet we continue to waste hours in traffic, arrive late for work and medical appointments, and miss out on family time.”
Entrants can submit a paper of five or fewer pages detailing the problem and addressing the solution with the intent to change the current policy landscape in the field of transportation and mobility.
According to the INRIX Global Traffic Scorecard, Boston-area commuters spent 164 hours driving in congestion last year, which costs each person $2,291.
Katy O’Brien of Somerville said ride-hail options could save drivers a lot of headaches: “Park outside the city and ride-share in.”
Angela Szarck, who lives by Fenway, took a more drastic approach, suggesting, “wider roads and no sidewalks.” Cole Durvett of Mission Hill also took a big leap and said, “Remap the entire city … maybe improve the T and encourage people not to drive.”
Congestion in Boston has been chalked up to steady population growth, an abundance of ride-hailing services, public transit issues and densely packed cities and towns in Greater Boston.
Eric Loring of Dorchester said, “I would put more money into the T and improve the T … I lived in Quincy for two years then moved to Dorchester. You get into your car and within five minutes you’re upset.”
The deadline to enter the Better Government Competition is May 31.
The contest hits as Boston enters the brutal summer road construction season, with work on the Tobin Bridge already causing epic traffic jams.
That lost time, said the Pioneer Institute’s Mary Z. Connaughton, is also hurting at home.
“Traffic congestion is not only stifling productivity, it’s eating into our very valuable family time,” Connaughton told the Herald on Saturday. “Pioneer Institute believes good old-fashioned American ingenuity can solve this enormous said growing issue and seeks ideas from here and across the country.”

Taxi riders in Japan will be able to confirm their fares in advance, under new transport ministry regulations designed to eliminate concerns over how much a ride will cost and encourage the use of cabs by foreign tourists.
The rule change takes effect around April, and taxi companies are expected to roll out the feature as early as this year.
A rider enters the destination on a mobile app and pays a fare based on the distance and a rate that accounts for potential congestion. Riders will not have to pay more when stuck in traffic, as is the case with metered fares. A 2017 trial drew generally positive feedback.
The set fares also will apply when a rider hails a cab on the street without booking in advance.
Taxi companies need to submit a description of the mobile app to the ministry for approval, along with other information.
Predetermined fares are common in ride-hailing services like Uber, which have taken root widely in the U.S. and other parts of Asia. But these services have not thrived in Japan, because drivers are not permitted to offer such rides using their personal vehicles.
Demand for convenient, worry-free transportation is growing as Japan welcomes more foreign visitors and its rising ranks of senior citizens stop driving their own cars. The government also is considering deregulation for shared taxi rides, propelled by the advance of digital technologies.

A new report from Allison+Partners, a global marketing and communications agency, suggests that changing definitions of transportation and an influx of new mobility solutions are paving the way for the birth of a new culture—the mobility culture.
Resulting from the intersection of transportation and technology, this cultural shift will be driven forward by the new generation of consumers just now coming of driving/ride-sharing age.
Much in the way Baby Boomers in their teens and twenties defined American car culture, Gen Z will ultimately become synonymous with mobility culture, the PR firm says. The study, “The Birth of Mobility Culture,” also explores implications for brand marketers as consumer values shift from “me” to “we” and access to new mobility options increase.
The report, based on a survey of US consumers fielded in January 2019, reveals a clear shift in consumer attitudes, values and behaviors between generations and with more transportation options available than ever before.
Key findings that highlight this shift include:

Cars remain at the center of today’s transportation equation, but how they’re used is changing. While roughly 70% of licensed Americans drive their vehicles daily, 38% of those without a driver’s license say they have no need for one. With Gen Z, the numbers become even more significant—nearly 70% of Gen Z respondents do not have their driver’s license and 30% of those who do not currently possess their driver’s license have no intention or desire to get one.
Car culture shifts from “me” to “we.” Younger generations, including Gen Z, have begun to see automotive benefits that move beyond convenience to relaxation and social experiences. When asked why they would purchase an autonomous vehicle, Gen Z consumers cited relaxation as a primary factor (65%)—almost equal to convenience (67%).
Technology and transportation have become synonymous. The excitement for autonomous technologies is driven by Gen Z, due largely to a high trust level with technology. Ultimately, 60% believe they will use autonomous vehicles by 2029.


Not only will the car itself change drastically with the advent of new technology and mobility solutions, but its role in our lives and in culture will also evolve. Our automotive practice was born out of an authentic passion for disruptive brands that are redefining mobility, with a deep understanding that the most important attributes of transportation for consumers are trust and loyalty.
—Marcus Gamo, Senior Vice President and Automotive Specialty Group Lead at Allison+Partners

The report also reveals that despite changing American consumer values and behaviors, brands remain more relevant than ever. For marketers, however, the introduction of this new mobility culture will require a revamped approach to effectively garner consumer loyalty and advocacy:

Reinforce how technology enhances the experience. With consumers conditioned to expect technology innovation at a faster rate than the traditional new vehicle introduction timeline, it’s important for marketers to reinforce how technology features enhance the ride experience, contribute to vehicle safety and support a future where transportation options come together in concert.
Demonstrate an understanding of the shift from “me” to “we.” It will be more important to underscore the benefits of a particular mobility option to communities of people (such as a city, university or corporate campus), rather than to just individual drivers.
Focus on building relationships during the journey, not at the finish line. Younger consumers value authentic relationships with brands, and it takes time to foster that trust. Understand their values, what advancements in automotive technology excite them and, equally important, their concerns about the future of mobility. Use this information to inform how to communicate and engage with them about your brand.
Consider new avenues for introducing mobility options. The traditional auto show has been the core of how automakers, motorcycle brands, RV makers and others have introduced new vehicles to a rabid group of automotive enthusiasts. Due to this shift in values and attitudes, marketers must now plan for more values-based, communal and experiential local market activations, where influencers help create and share the story and consumers can experience brand value in a real and authentic way.


As consumer relationships with cars evolve, automotive and transportation industry marketers must change how they engage with younger audiences, especially Gen Z.

A new survey for belairdirect has found more than half (53%) of polled Canadians would use an app that tracks their driving habits if it meant having a more personalized auto insurance rating.
The finding contrasts recent industry comments and studies on the topic.
Wawanesa told Canadian Underwriter in December 2017 that their customers were “not fans of telematics,” as reported to the insurer’s broker force. Telematics collects vehicle data including distance driven and driving behaviours such as speeding, sudden acceleration and hard braking.
Early this year, a Kanetix Ltd. study found respondents were more likely to share home (alarm and flood) and medical information with their insurers than lifestyle habits and driving information.
Owned by Intact Financial Corp., belairdirect offers a telematics program called automerit, which offers insurance rates based on kilometres driven. belairdirect conducted a recent study of more than 1,500 Canadians, finding that Millennials – usually defined as those currently aged 22-37 – were most likely to embrace technology in general.
belairdirect’s survey suggests that support for telematics is more or less evenly spread across generations. Asked about their willingness to use an app to track driving habits that might lead to personalized car insurance rating, the respondents’ willingness scores broke down by age as follows:

Ages 18-34: 57%
Ages 35-44: 50%
Ages 45-54: 56%
Ages 55-64: 46%
Ages 65+: 53%

It’s hard to pin down consumers’ responses to telematics by age, partly because the generational categories vary according to survey methodology. Another issue in measuring a customer’s “willingness” to use telematics may relate to a lack of specificity about telematics in the framing of the survey questions.
Andrew Lo, president and CEO of Kanetix, spoke to Canadian Underwriter in January about the Kanetix study. Lo said he believes respondents may show less willingness to share driver data, compared to home and medical information, because consumers are not clear about what data they are sharing, how the information is going to be used, and the benefits they get from opting into a telematics program (beyond saving a small amount on insurance, for example).

On the data security matter, in Kanetix’s study, 35% of respondents were concerned about the security of data, and respondents in the over 45-age group were less likely to share data in general. “I think the younger demographic may be more accepting of this as part of daily life,” Lo said.
A belairdirect spokesperson said Tuesday the company is committed to protecting privacy and uses “strict security safeguards when storing or destroying personal information in order to prevent unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks.”
belairdirect’s study frames the benefits of telematics in terms of discounts for kilometres driven.
The main reason people drive less is to save money related to owning and operating a vehicle, according to 75% of the survey. Although 71% of vehicle owners drive at least five days a week, 32% are driving less than 10,000 kilometres per year. Perhaps an expression of frustration with downtown gridlock, respondents living in urban areas were more likely to use the company’s automerit app (64%), compared to suburban (53%) and rural (51%) drivers.

In a matter of only a few years, the ridesharing apps Uber and Lyft have gone from novel ideas to core pieces of the transportation fabric in cities around the globe.
Now, both companies are poised to go public and offer shares on the stock market. But why are they going public now?
Here’s what we know.
What are Lyft and Uber offering?
Lyft announced its preliminary initial public offering price Monday — between $62 and $68 per share. The final price will be set after a “road show” with investors this week and before the company goes public March 29. Its stock will be listed on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol LYFT.
Lyft plans to offer 30 million shares of its company, with the option for investment banks to buy 4.6 million more. Some of the stocks will be reserved for the company’s cofounders The offering could raise $2 billion for the company and would set its value at as much as $23 billion.
That potential valuation is still much smaller than Uber’s, which is privately valued at $72 billion and is expected to go public next month.
Who owns the market?
Uber and Lyft have been in fierce competition for market share in the domestic ride hailing business, while also investing in new lines of businesses, including food delivery and autonomous vehicles.
Estimates on who controls the market vary. Lyft claims it now accounts or 35 percent of all rides taken. The latest estimate from Second Measure, a firm that analyzes purchases on credit and debit cards, puts that number at closer to 28.9 percent — three points higher than last year. Uber, according to Second Measure, has approximately 69.2 percent of the market. The company has increasingly relied on its food delivery business, UberEATS, to make up for slowing growth in its traditional ridesharing business.
In recent months, both companies have been offering steep discounts to their customers in an attempt to corner more of the market before they go public.
The company with the largest market share could be seen as having the best potential for investors. That will be Uber, for now, but Lyft is hoping it can show its market share is rising and could eventually surpass Uber’s.
Why go public now?
Investment money has flowed into companies like Uber and Lyft, which have the potential to grow substantially despite high upfront costs.
Since the two ridesharing giants were founded — Uber in 2009 and Lyft in 2012 — they have taken in billions of dollars in capital from investors.
At this point, said Semil Shah, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, Uber and Lyft have probably “tapped out” most of the late-stage investment firms that can supply the billions of dollars they’re seeking to cover debts and expand into new lines of business such as scooter and bike rentals. Were they to delay going public and return to existing investors for additional money, it might come with onerous strings attached, such as discounted shares in an eventual public offering.


Both companies have been offering steep discounts to their customers in an attempt to corner more of the market before they go public.

“When you have investors for 10 years, at some point you have to return the money to them,” said Santosh Rao, the head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners.
Uber has in the past allowed a limited few early shareholders to sell portions of their holdings to new investors. But even still they’ve been prevented from offloading as much as they’d like. Tech companies are notorious for maintaining a tight grip on ownership in their early days for fear of losing the freedom to make risky bets.
By heading for the stock market, existing investors get an opportunity to cash out, while the ridesharing giants gain access to a new pool of investors.
But filing paperwork for an offering doesn’t necessarily indicate either company has an urgent need to raise money. In the third quarter of 2018, Uber, which releases basic financial statements even though federal law does not require privately-held companies to do so, reported that it ended the year with $7.3 billion left in the bank.
Instead, experts said Uber and Lyft have likely looked at recent tumult in the global economy and decided they need to be prepared to go public in case the U.S. enters a recession in the next few years. A recession would make it more difficult to raise capital from investors and get a high price on their IPO.

“We’ve had the longest running bull market,” Rao said — that is, a general trend of stocks rising. “So I’m sure at the back of their minds they’re saying, ‘You know, let’s not wait until this whole ride ends and there’s a lull or a slowdown.’”
Other darlings of the tech industry, such as Snap Inc., which owns Snapchat, have gone public on a similar message: that they need to burn cash at a fast pace if they want to grow. But many of those companies struggled once they tried to turn a profit. Snap began trading in 2017 at an opening price of $17 per share. It is now trading at about $11.
Still, Rao stressed that the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain solid, and both Uber and Lyft are strong enough to withstand scrutiny by public investors.
“There’s not much else to prove on the private side,” he adds. “I think it’s the right time to get out.”
Why the companies are going public around the same time
Market conditions aside, the fact that the rivals filed their paperwork within days of one another is likely not a coincidence.
Shah, the partner at Lightspeed, said the two watch each other’s movements closely and act accordingly.


Going public can serve as a marketing tool for Uber — a signal to investors and the public that they’ve moved on from their tumultuous past.

Uber has been making efforts to improve its reputation since Khosrowshahi took over as CEO in 2017, following the ouster of Travis Kalanick. Kalanick was plagued by accusations that he fostered a culture of winning at all costs, even if that meant flouting the rule of law in cities around the world. Uber has been the subject of criminal investigations into its conduct, a problem that Lyft has largely avoided.
Shah said going public can serve as a marketing tool for Uber — a signal to investors and the public that they’ve moved on from their tumultuous past and are ready for greater scrutiny.
“Uber had its own self-inflicted wounds and stumbles,” Rao said. “It’s coming back now. They’ve straightened out their management, they’ve got the culture going in the right direction. They’d probably like the public to see that.”
Can the companies become profitable?
In 2018, Lyft brought in about $2 billion in revenue, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, and Uber processed about $48 billion in sales each year. But neither company is profitable.
Lyft reported it lost $911 million in 2018 and Uber lost $1.8 billion.
Uber has chalked that up to its investment in new lines of business, like food delivery and the development of self-driving vehicles, that it hopes could eventually generate new revenue streams.
Many experts think both companies have fundamentally sound business models and could become profitable in the near future if they pare back further investments in growth.
That’s the primary thing investors will be watching for after the companies go public, Rao said: a consistent growth in ridership along with falling expenses. If their core businesses are strong, investors will be able to stomach the losses as they invest in new products — at least for a few years, as Uber and Lyft, once they’re publicly traded, continue vying for ridesharing dominance.
Both companies have the same long term goal, Rao said: to be the last one standing. “That’s basically what this business is,” he said.

Besides the unique and patent-protected vehicle, Share your BICAR AG offers a smartphone application as well as a battery replacement station. Users have the option to very easily exchange the battery in just 30 seconds for extended rides or on days when they cannot generate enough solar power. Share your BICAR AG’s products can be optimally integrated into existing mobility sharing fleets, no matter whether they consist of cars, scooters with or without mo- torization or bicycles. The mobility sharing provider’s end customer will be able to enjoy a mobility solution that is not only fun to drive, but also practical: Ready for use throughout the year and energy autonomous since it is powered by renewable solar energy. 
BICAR ideally complements public transportation. It is the perfect substitute for numerous short to medium length urban area trips currently done by using a car. The combination of BICAR, smartphone APP and battery exchange sta- tion is also an attractive option for operators of business fleets aiming to offer their customers and employees an en- ergy as well as cost efficient solution for their mobility needs. BICAR allows to drive conveniently to business appoint- ments across town, bypassing traffic jams and time-consuming searches for parking spaces. «Our concept of new mo- bility extends far beyond strictly technical innovation. Sustainable manufacturing and business models frame our cor- porate concept,» comments Adrian Burri, the founder and CEO of Share your BICAR AG. 
In close cooperation with researchers at the School of Engineering at the ZHAW Zürcher Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften (Zurich University of Applied Sciences), the new BICAR was developed in record time. The research team presented the BICAR concept version as early as 2015. At the time, it was considered a Mobility 2030 flagship project. The same team provided intense support for the development of the new BICAR. In this adapted version, the BICAR meets the current European mandates for public road operation permits.

The BICAR is being developed in compliance with the Cradle to Cradle CertifiedTM1 product certification and will be manufactured in Europe. 
To attain compliance with the certification criteria, Share your BICAR AG is collaborating with 
1 Cradle to Cradle CertifiedTM is a certification mark exclusively licensed by the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute.
The product certification assesses 5 criteria: material health, material reutilization, renewable energy and CO2 compensation, water and social fairness to achieve a healthy and positive impact for society and the environment. 
EPEA Switzerland GmbH experts who are accredited assessors for the Cradle to Cradle CertifiedTM certification.. All material ingredients >100 ppm (0.01%) and numerous suppliers must have their processes assessed under the Cradle to Cradle CertifiedTM Standard. «Cradle to Cradle® means implementing a paradigm change away from linear business models to a new dimension of opportunities/risks inherent in product quality and safety and manufacturing in infinite cycles,» adds the head of the EPEA Switzerland, Albin Kälin. 
Immediately after the successful presentation of the new BICAR at the Geneva International Motorshow, the produc- tion planning for the first vehicle will be rolled out. To quickly accommodate the large number of inquiries from all over the world that have already been received, the BICAR team has imposed a stringent time table upon itself. As of fall 2019, a small fleet of 5 to 10 vehicles will initially be deployed in sharing programs – first in Winterthur, followed by Baden and Basel.
The necessary cooperative agreements with the locals in charge have been executed. The com- pany will apply for approval for series production shortly thereafter and work towards a cooperation with a produc- tion partner, so that the BICAR mobility solution will be on the market as early as 2020. 
The BICAR highlights at a glance BICAR has been developed as shared mobility solution. Due to its fantastic, user friendly benefits BICAR serves to all kind of target groups – sharing operations at cities worldwide as well as business fleets and end consumers.

The auto industry is betting big on blockchain. In fact, a whopping 62% of auto executives say the technology underpinning bitcoin will be a disruptive force in the industry by 2021.
Moreover, 95% of carmakers plan to make “moderate to significant” blockchain investments over the next three years, according to a report by the IBM Institute for Business Value, a business-research group.
In its executive report entitled “Daring to Be First,” the IBM Institute says blockchain can revolutionize the auto industry by bringing transparency to supply chain management and financial transactions.
Auto Industry Invests in Blockchain
Here are some key findings:

62% of executives say blockchain will be a disruptive force in the industry within 3 years.
54% expect new business models to influence investments in blockchain.
54% of executives will implement their first commercial blockchain network at scale within 3 years.

Industry leaders believe that the ingenuity of distributed ledger systems will bolster the use of smart contracts, which are self-executing, self-enforcing contracts.
“Thousands of parts go into the assembly of a vehicle,” the IBM report noted. “The inability to track and verify the parts can result in parts that do not work properly when they are integrated with others. Performance issues and customer dissatisfaction can then occur.”
Auto executives are counting on the blockchain promise of secure, traceable transactions and improved transparency of information to streamline supply chain management.
Source: IBM Institute
The IBM Institute pointed out that German auto giant Porsche has been testing blockchain applications in its vehicles since February 2018.
As CCN reported, Porsche has been developing blockchain applications to park cars, lock and unlock vehicles, and make loaning out a company car to an employee easier.
Because all transactions are recorded on a distributed ledger, car owners would be able to monitor who used their vehicle and when. This could play a major factor in expanding the “sharing” economy that has skyrocketed during the past few years.

Reinventing Mobility
Transportation is essential to economic and social development as it facilitates the movement of people and goods. However, burgeoning populations and growing urbanization paralleled by the surging demand for mobility has overburdened transport networks, particularly in urban areas. Such pressures have also intensified problems related to pollution and congestion.
New mobility business models, enabled through technology and accessed primarily through smartphones, have emerged in response to these challenges. In many cases, such models are upturning conventional notions of car ownership or lease, replacing them with a new wave of services ranging from car-sharing, ride-hailing and integrated mobility.
Connectivity and Shared Mobility Technologies 
The Shared Mobility space is evolving rapidly. 
New business models are improving fleet utilization as well as catering to a wider customer base. For example, car-sharing platforms are expanding to include ride-hailing and bike-sharing while P2P cars-haring platforms are broadening to include ride-hailing and leasing.
Technology providers need not only to provide solutions that can be expanded to other business models but also those that can be integrated; in other words, they need to become providers of complete modular solutions.
Omoove
Octo Telematics’ subsidiary Omoove is the European Shared Mobility Technology Service Provider leader and offers its clients the only Shared Mobility Solution with a Triple Integrated Play: Vehicle Sharing, Enhanced Vehicle Management and Insurance Telematics for Mobility Operators and Car Rental Companies. Founded in 2001, Omoove currently operates more than 10 car-sharing services in 15 cities with about 200,000 connected vehicles and scooters, 900,000 registered users and over 400,000 rentals per month.
Last month, Omoove has launched a new initiative: The Mobility Leaders Circle. It is a collaborative platform where mobility leaders can contribute with their opinions, articles, scientific researches, etc. Some of the questions – but not limited to these – they want to find an answer (or more than one) are:
“What are new ways of solving urban mobility problems? How can we better design systems to address the needs of the public? Who should be engaged to make this happen?”

Since it rolled out its e-scooters in Singapore in November last year, American e-scooter company Lime has seen the number of trips taken daily on its bright green wheelers increase by three fold.
Homegrown start-up Telepod also saw the number of trips taken on its e-scooters double in the last three months, while Grab, which piloted its GrabWheels service at the National University of Singapore (NUS) last November, said that the service went on to clock some “40,000km worth of rides” within a month.
These firms are among 14 operators that have submitted applications to operate sharing services for motorised personal mobility devices (PMDs), under sandbox licences with the authorities here.
Most of the 14 plan to roll out e-scooter services, with others such as 0MN1 Sharing planning to launch a seated PMD.
It signals a continued interest in the shared mobility scene here, at a time when the bicycle-sharing market is roiled with reports of Ofo’s cash crunch and its suspension in Singapore, as well as oBike’s abrupt shutdown of its operations here last year.

TODAY understands that each firm could apply to operate a fleet of no more than 500 PMDs, and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is expected to announce the results of the applications by the second quarter of this year.
Banking on young people and office workers who need to get to work “without breaking a sweat”, and taking in the “hard lessons” learnt from bicycle-sharing operators, the applicants are not held back by doubts over the viability of the bike-sharing business model.
Mr Ashwin Purushottam, 33, general manager of Lime Singapore, said that the firm is hoping to roll out 500 e-scooters under the sandbox licence.
It deployed about 50 to 100 e-scooters at Singapore Science Park 1 and 2 in the One-north area over the last three months, under a partnership with property developer Ascendas-Singbridge.
Another applicant going for the PMD sandbox licence is GoGreen Holdings. Its general manager Janice Lim, 33, believes that there is a chance e-scooters and PMDs may be more popular than bicycles.
“It takes just minutes to get the hang of riding an e-scooter… whereas not everyone knows how to ride a bicycle.”
She added that e-scooters could be a more practical option in Singapore’s climate, because users perspire less riding an e-scooter than on a bicycle.
Mr Htay Aung, 28, founder of bike-sharing firm AnyWheel, said that e-scooters could cater to women who “may not be comfortable with riding a bicycle when they are wearing a skirt”. He plans to launch e-scooter services under the brand JustScoot.
Other new players such as American mobility platform Helbiz said that Singapore’s infrastructure, especially around the central city area, allows for e-scooter services to thrive.
Mr Stefano Ciravegna, 38, head of strategy and investor relations at Helbiz, said: “(Singapore) is almost made for scooters to move around. The city is well-connected.”
HEALTHY DEMAND
Despite the predicament that some bike-sharing companies are facing, PMD operators vying for a slice of the pie are optimistic about the potential of shared transportation here, buoyed by the good demand for e-scooter services.
Since piloting its GrabWheels service at the National University of Singapore (NUS) in November, Grab said that the service went on to clock some “40,000km worth of rides” within a month.
Referring to a survey done by NUS, a Grab spokesperson said that close to 80 per cent of students on campus use its GrabWheels service at least one to four times a week.
Telepod, which saw the number of trips taken on its e-scooters double in the last three months, operates between 300 and 500 e-scooters in several areas including the Central Business District and One-north.
Mr Purushottam from Lime said that “early adopters seem to be students or individuals in their early 30s and commuters going to work”. Those aged between 18 and 60 are also able to use it quickly, he added.
PREVENTING PROBLEMS
Addressing the problems faced by bike-sharing firms, such as indiscriminate parking, Mr Purushottam said that operators have to maintain greater oversight of their vehicles since the batteries of e-scooters have to be charged. This would prevent e-scooters from “blanketing the city with no regard for regulations”.
One of 0MN1 Sharing’s directors, Mr Moises Chavez, 29, said unlike e-scooters, the bike-sharing model was based on “scaling explosively by simply dumping bikes” into the market.
“Bicycle companies did not need to invest in their own internal operational crew to rebalance and reorient the fleet. You cannot do the same with e-scooters because the batteries need to be recharged,” Mr Chavez said.
He added that the limit on fleet size under the sandbox licence will also level the playing field. “Efficient operations and high quality service” will then become the differentiators among the players, he said.
Ms Lim from GoGreen Holdings said that “shared bicycles have more parts that are likely to be tampered with”, for example missing saddles, pedals and broken chains. “We will see less of that problem in e-scooter sharing.”
With the authorities seeking to nip the spike in the number of reported accidents involving PMDs, bicycles and power-assisted bicycles on public paths, Lime acknowledged that there is some “inherent risk” in using any PMD and the onus is on the PMD providers to create that awareness of how to ride safely.
It signed a memorandum of understanding with Asian Detours, an LTA-appointed facilitator of the Safe Riding Programme, a national initiative aimed at equipping cyclists and PMD users with the knowledge and skills to ride safely.
Lime added that it will conduct pop-ups in parks and malls in the coming months.
SUSTAINABILITY, PRICING
Aware that competition and sustainability will be factors for survival, the operators said that the failure of some bicycle-sharing businesses here serves as a cautionary tale for them.

“Bicycle sharing provided some hard lessons for everyone to learn,” Ms Lim said, adding that data collected “during the sandbox licence period” will enable the LTA to study the improvements operators have to make and allow for “better policies to be created”.
The authorities are already taking a closer regulatory oversight over the roll-out of e-scooter services, compared with two years ago when shared bicycles first entered the market here.
Last November, the LTA impounded 42 PMDs from Neuron Mobility, Telepod and Beam because they were found at public places, in violation of the Parking Places Act.
LTA had granted exemptions to operators to provide such services only in specified boundaries, for example at One-north.
From a business point of view, one transport economist is unsure if the pricing of e-scooters services will be able to cover the “high costs” of operations.
Dr Walter Theseira from the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) said: “It all depends on the pricing, as e-scooter operators incur higher capital and logistics costs as (the e-scooters) require near-daily charging.”
Most of the operators now charge between S$0.15 and S$0.20 per minute.
Telepod charges users S$0.15 a minute. Lime charges S$1 to unlock rides and S$0.15 for every minute its e-scooters are used.
Dr Theseira cautioned that the influx of potential e-scooter operators signalling interest in the market could point towards a similar “speculative bubble” akin to what happened with the bike-sharing business.
It is likely that operators will try to “over-saturate the market”, the consequence being that it will be “impossible” for any operator to have enough usage to cover their costs, he added.

Is New York City’s car-share pilot working?
In one short — and very premature — word: yes.
The city has been setting aside on-street parking for car-share companies since June in hopes of reducing private car ownership — and a final report isn’t due until September. But we’re impatient, so we called Susan Shaheen, a researcher at UC Berkeley’s Transportation Sustainability Research Center, who has been hired by DOT to ask NYC car-share users how the program has changed their travel behavior.
What are the potential positives of car-sharing?
When I first was exposed to the concept of auto-sharing, what appealed to me was that it had the ability to shift people away from the fixed costs of car-use into a variable model. You only use car-share when you need to. One of the findings from Europe, after it became more popularized there in the late 1980s, was that auto ownership declined with car-share use.
What I’m starting to see from the earlier New York survey work in April is some of those same trends, particularly the round-trip model.
The next question is: if people did or did not give up their own cars, how did car-share influence their use of other modes? How does the use of other modes in the ecosystem change as a result of car-sharing? The causal link component is something we put a lot of attention on because we want to understand — did car-share cause less car ownership. We want to work with participants to understand if the introduction of car-share in their lives changed their behavior.
We’re trying to help New York City unravel how their car share is impacting human behavior.
Who uses car-share?
Of the round-trip car-sharing members we surveyed in April 2018, most joined for additional mobility because they did not own/lease a personal vehicle.Members tend to be male and Caucasian, although membership does include people who identify as Asian, Black/African, and Hispanic/Latino. Women make up less than half of the membership population, which is not unusual in car-sharing more generally.
One thing we’ve found in our two decades of research is that there’s no one response to an innovation. What we see in our surveys is a whole range of response. In some cases, you’ll see that some people now have access to a car, and what is happening is they’re traveling more by car.
How does joining car-share tend to impact user travel behavior?
Members tend to use car-sharing for recreational trips within and outside the five boroughs. This is consistent with prior car-sharing research in the U.S. Members also tend to use car-sharing vehicles to go to/from the grocery store and move bulky items. This is consistent with prior car-sharing research in the U.S.

If round-trip car-sharing was unavailable, slightly more people would have taken [Uber/Lyft] than rail, more would have rented a car from a traditional car rental company, and some would not have taken the trip.
About half of people who gave up one personal vehicle did so due to the car-sharing service. Many New Yorkers surveyed did not have a car to get rid of in the year before they became car-sharing members.
Does that mean that car-share will cause more New Yorkers to drive?
My colleague Robert Cervero has studied this in San Francisco. Initially, a lot of people who were attracted to car-share were non-car owners. Then, over time, they found more people who owned cars joined the system. Eventually, there was a net decline in vehicle miles traveled. What we’ve seen in a lot of the research we’ve done in shared mobility.
In New York City, we’re seeing a combination of people who have cars and people who don’t. It’s not one way or the other.
Along with that question, an important question needs to be asked: Were you thinking of buying a car anyway? We don’t just like if you sell a car, but did car-share cause you to suppress buying a car? You can’t just say, “OK, this person didn’t own a car so they’re driving all over the place.”
As somebody who’s studied this phenomenon for 25 years, I can tell you that the fixed costs of auto ownership cause people to use their cars more often. The marginal cost of each trip is small. Once people invest in the car, they’re invested in that form of mobility in an almost exclusive fashion.
What are some challenges cities face when introducing car-share?
Per this New York Times article, there can be dissent from citizens, if they perceive that parking spots that they are used to having for their personal vehicles are repurposed for car-sharing. In New York City, there is already competition for parking spaces. It’s also challenging to expand car-sharing to low-income and minority groups. In this project, we will compare car-sharing member demographics to neighborhood demographics to investigate whether a wider population is using car-sharing in New York City.

After ranking fifth in the 2018 Shared Mobility City Index (SMCI) by transportation consultant Movmi Shared Transportation Services, Vancouver dropped two spots, to No. 7, in this year’s report.
The study, by Vancouver-based Movmi, aims to assess the scope of and expansion potential for shared mobility in 20 major North American cities.
Unsurprisingly, the absence of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft contributed to Vancouver’s fall down the list—Montreal is now the top Canadian city, one place ahead of Vancouver—but it wasn’t the only reason for the drop.
According to the report, B.C.’s largest city is falling behind other municipalities in building out a range of increasingly diverse shared mobility services such as scooters, pedal-assist bikes and micro-transit (smaller transit vehicles deployed on a demand-responsive basis). Vancouver tied with Houston and two other cities for the lowest score on a measure of the current range of shared mobility services.
The study also pointed out Vancouver’s lack of peer-to-peer car sharing services, which many American cities, including Portland and Chicago, now offer.
Such services involve private owners making their vehicles available as part of a pool.
Like Uber and other ride-hailing providers, they’re currently barred in Vancouver due to provincial regulation.
However, Vancouver showed well in “commuting patterns,” tying with Washington, D.C., for first place in the category, which measures how many people in the area choose walking, cycling and public transit over cars. The report also points out that Vancouver has the world’s largest Car2gomembership base.
“Vancouverites can be rightly proud of their pioneering role as subscribers to car-sharing services. But shared mobility is increasingly about a whole ecosystem of diverse and integrated transportation modes and solutions,” Sandra Phillips, founder and CEO of Movmi, said in a release. “Ride-hailing isn’t the only thing we’re missing here, and we need to catch up with the many other North American cities that are speeding toward a wide range of new shared mobility options.”

IMAGINE A FUTURE IN WHICH IT IS MORE convenient and less costly to own a subscription to a ride-share service not unlike Uber or Lyft to get around, rather than owning a car. No searching crowded parking lots for a space. No dealing with insurance companies, stopping for gas, or regular maintenance. Perhaps no human driver at all.
In this future of mobility, the city you live in provides on-demand access to autonomous vehicles that are seamlessly integrated into a complete system of transportation, one that is friendly to walking, biking, scooters and probably solar-powered golf carts, too. In other words, anything that lessens dependence on personal vehicles though does not preclude using them — perhaps just for pleasure, a ride behind the wheel of a genuine 20th or early 21st century antique.
Who knows how long it will take to get there or if the future will look quite like this? That depends in part on how quickly technology advances along with markets’ and governments’ ability to fold it in to traditional practices. But it is a future that Babcock Ranch planners have envisioned and that the city’s developer, Kitson & Partners, is reaching toward with its autonomous and electric vehicles, bike-share program and a “smart community app” that will help residents access transit services.

Babcock Ranch Transportation Services is beginning to build a transit system in this city that one day expects to hold some 50,000 people. The BRTS board is made up of two Kitson employees and two employees of Transdev, a transportation technology company that describes itself as the largest private provider of multiple modes of transport in North America.
“They’re really our operating partners when it comes to running a transit system,” said Tom Hoban, BRTS board member and Babcock Ranch president and CIO.
The BRTS board is keeping an open mind about any alternative modes of transportation that could play a role in an integrated system that helps reduce dependence on personal vehicles, Mr. Hoban said. The long-term vision, he added, is that BRTS “is truly a transportation service … That’s a bike share, a Zip car (an Avis car subscription service), autonomous vehicles, scooters, you name it.
“But it’s anything other than just jumping in your car and driving yourself.”
In the near term, he suggests, homeowners might be able to manage their needs with one vehicle instead of two and benefit from substantial savings on both cost and convenience as a result. In the long-term, they might not need to own car at all.
Early suggestions of what is to come are found within two autonomous shuttles at Babcock Ranch. Built by EasyMile, they are used to carry potential homebuyers out to view model homes. BRTS is looking toward expanding the use of autonomous vehicles to practical uses for residents.
“I think the point of moving from the marketing side of it to the real practical, on-demand use of it is a really critical step we’re taking right now,” Mr. Hoban said. “We’re really excited about it.”
Along with Transdev and Levatas, a tech company focused on software development, they are creating a comprehensive community app called Key- Link that will allow residents to hail a ride or have groceries delivered to their doorstep. Its numerous other features will include a virtual concierge. A group of Babcock Ranch residents are currently being recruited to help test the app’s transportation services before an initial version is released, possibly later this year.
A team of designers at Levatas created the look and practical features of the app, such as a feature that will allow residents to use systems such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home to hail a ride by voice command. At least in its initial phase, the technology is designed specifically to be used inside Babcock Ranch.
“(It) is a great area to roll it out because it’s a controlled environment with limited variables,” said Brian Dunnam, chief technology officer of Levatas.
Suggestions of what is to come are found in the town’s new paid bike-share program, one of the first of its kind in Southwest Florida (though it has long been in practice in Punta Gorda, West Palm Beach and Miami and other U.S. metropolitan areas).
And it is built into Babcock’s overall design, its bike lanes and pathways, if not yet its parking lots and the two-car garage designs on some of its single-family homes. Government rules and market needs still require certain provisions that might not be necessary in the future of mobility, which requires flexible planning. For instance, if customers are taking an autonomous shuttle to the grocery store, that store might not need four spaces per 1,000 (square feet). Maybe you only need one or two.
“It’s very early in this revolution of the transportation industry,” Mr. Hoban said. “But my point is you need multiple components growing in the same direction to really effectuate wholesale change…
“You try to plan with as much flexibility as you can to capitalize on the change that’s coming.”
Kitson & Partners is not original in this vision for transportation in coming years, although the company is unique in being able to incorporate it from the ground up in a city built from scratch. The ideas are found in decades-old mobility movements within the architectural and real-estate practices of New Urbanism, in the official state-adopted policy of roadway design called Complete Streets, and the increasingly trendy practice of transportation-oriented design — ideas that dovetail with the movement to “go green” and to embrace green technologies, to live healthier lifestyles, and with the environmental consciousness that has from the beginning been behind Syd Kitson’s vision for the town, with its large swaths of preserved land, “ranch-to-table” community garden and, of course, the vast solar field that supplies its power.
The town’s innovative approach to transportation might be considered by other cities and businesses in the future, said Greg Lindsay, director of applied research at the Montreal-based think tank NewCities Foundation.
“One future of mobility is you don’t own a vehicle,” he said. “Your employer has a fleet of shuttles. Or the mall does. Or your multi-family apartment building has a service.”
Or Babcock Ranch provides it, powered by its solar field.
“I think cities could learn from (Babcock Ranch) in the sense that they’re doing real-world testing,” Mr. Lindsay said.
Some of Babcock Ranch’s real estate development, built with this future of mobility in mind, could reflect what he calls “urbanized suburbs.” That is, areas that might not be near the downtown core of a city, but at the same time are not only the typical bedroom communities of “white picket fences and cul-de-sacs and two-car garages” that many envision when they hear that word.
Instead, they might be made up of mixed-use commercial and residential property that provides a more vibrant lifestyle or have easy walking and biking access to them, something Babcock strives to offer residents as it plans for an evolving world of transportation. ¦

Can a self-driving car operating on a blockchain honk at you, or does it need to enter into an EDCC (aka smart contract) before initiating that kind of action?
All cheekiness aside, the Patent and Trademark Office recently published US car manufacturer General Motors’ (GM) filed patent application, which details the process by which self-driving cars would be able to manage and store data on a distributed ledger.
The patent application notes that a blockchain “enabl[es] a distributed consensus of trust where all transactions can be verified in the future by participants of the blockchain exchange without compromising privacy,” making it a suitable system for autonomous vehicles that require “high degrees of integrity of the temporal event data for vehicle operations.”

The application outlines a distributed ledger system that would store data generated by autonomous vehicles and make that data accessible only to the users of the blockchain. Highlighting the technology’s use in navigation, it explains: “It is desirable to provide locations information and densities of vehicles in regions in an online blockchain ledger for interoperable information sharing between vehicles of participants for use in navigating routes.”
Beyond route navigation, the patent proposes several types of information that can be shared via a blockchain system, including the availability of charging or refueling stations. The system can also connect municipalities, regional authorities, and public facilities to determine the “validity of permits and licenses to operate as hacks, taxis, or other for-hire services.”
Furthermore, sharing data between the different independent platforms would allow for, say, a ticketed car’s information to be shared on a blockchain run by that specific authority, or maintaining a balance for charges related to “tolls, parking, car washes, and access to other fee based services.”
GM has shown interest in blockchain tech before. In May 2018, ETHNews covered the announcement of the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative, unveiled by GM, BMW, and Ford. The organization seeks to devise and promote standards for integrating blockchain technology into automotive travel.

In today’s day and age, ride-sharing has become increasingly popular amongst teenagers and young adults who use the service for a variety of purposes: as a designated driver, as a convenient navigator, and increasingly, as a backup in the event that public transportation fails.
In contrast to other modes of transportation, ride-share services have done their utmost to virtually guarantee a set of commandments: fairly priced, always sober, and always safe.

Unfortunately, this has also caused a decline in public transportation, specifically the taxi.
Though taxis can sometimes be cheaper, it’s questionable whether or not they are dependable.
With one tap of your screen, you could hypothetically order one of many possible Ubers in an area. With taxis, there’s no app or definite ride.
Even major cities like New York City or Los Angeles are seeing a fall in public transportation in favor of ride-sharing. The efforts of the government to ensure that taxis stay on the road will soon not be enough. ith recent innovations in technology and ride-sharing, the demise of taxi driving is inevitable because ride-sharing receives major support and will not fail unless Uber or Lyft themselves find a way to limit driving services.
However, that hasn’t stopped taxi drivers from mounting a fierce resistance effort.
The New York City Council has proposed a new law that aims to decrease the influence of the ride-sharing industry, which has been the recipient of blame for low wages and poor traffic conditions.
According to an article by The Verge, this law would make NYC one of the first cities to ever put a maximum on the number of ride-sharing vehicles on the streets, granting favor to the marginalized taxi.
According to the New York Times, the bill was first introduced in 2015 but was abandoned after many supporters publicly backed Uber and Lyft.
The bill was brought into the rotation again in 2018, and if the legislation is approved, ride-sharing allowance will be based on “needs,” such as transportation to work or school, as opposed to “wants.” Uber employee Josh Gold, along with customers, voiced their disapproval for the legislation, stating that “the cap will leave New Yorkers stranded.”
An article by CNBC also stated that taxi drivers in London are preparing to sue Uber for 1.3 billion U.S. dollars on the account of lost earnings. Although Uber recently won the right to operate in the United Kingdom, the company’s legitimacy could soon be abolished due to lack of proper employee preparedness, like drug testing and background checks.
If Uber is unable to operate in the United Kingdom, it would be a major win for the taxi driving industry in the U.K.

Nevertheless, for those who live in residential areas like college towns and neighborhoods such as Isla Vista, the lack of widespread public transportation means that most residents are forced to use a ride-share service.
There is no doubt in the public mind that ride-sharing applications will eventually have a leg up over taxis. It may sometimes cost you more in a big place like New York City, but it is a small price to pay for efficiency and reliability. For those who urgently need transportation, Uber and Lyft are your best bet.
The only way that ride-sharing can fail is if the companies are part of a larger controversy. With the support ride-sharing has received and will continue to encounter, however, it is likely that taxi driving may become a thing of distant memory.

A recent report on the global artificial intelligence (AI) talent pool estimates that there are fewer than 10,000 people worldwide with the competencies necessary to undertake advanced research in AI.
With demand for talent outpacing supply, U of T Engineering continues to create opportunities to prepare engineers to lead and contribute their expertise in this booming field. On Nov. 22, alumni working in data analytics and AI are coming back to Skule™ to network with current graduate students and discuss careers in the industry. Experts on new approaches and emerging applications for AI will share their diverse experiences in areas from blockchain to telecommunications.
Alice Gong (EngSci 1T7+PEY) is one of nine alumni sharing her insights. Gong is a software engineer at General Motors (GM), where her work in AI is advancing GM’s research toward semi-autonomous, hands-free driving on highways.
Gong was among the first class to graduate from U of T Engineering’s robotics major in Engineering Science, and was also part of aUToronto, the award-winning student team working to turn an electric vehicle fully autonomous as part of the three-year international Autodrive Challenge.
Gong recently spoke with Liz Do to share her career journey so far, and how she applied her U of T Engineering experience into a career in data analytics and AI.
What sparked your interest in autonomous vehicles?
I initially wanted to do a biomedical engineering major, but then the robotics major had just launched at U of T Engineering and I thought, why not try it. Studying the major made me want to dig deeper into robotics and all aspects of programming. This led me to pursue my Professional Experience Year Co-op Program (PEY Co-op) at Zebra Technologies.
Reading and learning on my commute on public transit brought me lots of growth, but its schedule constraints also annoyed me, which made me think more about self-driving cars. I then went on to join aUToronto, and this further developed my interest in autonomous driving and led me onto my current role at General Motors.
What do you do at GM?
I’m working to further develop Super Cruise technology at GM. Super Cruise is an assistive-driving technology, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel on mapped, divided highways. It’s semi-autonomous because there is still a camera that monitors drivers’ eyes to keep them engaged – you can’t just go to the back and read a book yet.
A lot of companies’ efforts into creating semi-autonomous or autonomous driving technologies have faced challenges, such as the risk for car accidents due to a driver’s lack of attention. Our technology makes sure that drivers can only enable the function when they are actually on the highway – which is a controlled environment without stop signs or pedestrians.

My particular work is currently on global localization of a vehicle on our high-definition maps to enable more active safety and navigation features in the future.
Right now, this technology is only in one high-end model of Cadillacs but we will definitely extend the coverage in the future. It’s an exciting time to be in the automotive industry.
How has data analytics changed your industry?
 I see that a lot of potential ideas have been inspired by the tech industry, and that the automotive industry is keen to innovate and make use of advanced theories. An existing example is the implementation of Waze, which crowd-sources traffic data to help drivers avoid traffic and get home sooner — crowd-sourcing makes heavy use of data analytics knowledge.
The automotive industry is starting to realize that we can use data and AI to improve the experience of our day-to-day travels, and our team is already working towards many future features inspired by it.
Why is it important for graduate students to prepare themselves in the area of data analytics and AI?
There are already many senior engineers who have worked in this industry for decades. When junior engineers, like me, join the automotive industry, we have a lot of experience to gain, but at the same time we can provide insights into cutting-edge algorithms, new technologies, new ways to solve problems. This is definitely the case if you are graduating with the deep knowledge of robotics, or machine learning or AI.
Being able to implement algorithms in the most efficient and robust ways are even more important than ideas themselves, because the products you build are not just for experiments – there will be costs to the company and possibly to society if it fails. Solid implementation skills like coding are not just the means to an end, it’s what turns a dream into reality.
I think it’s also more important than ever for our generation to continue to build their unique perspectives and stay at the cutting edge with life-long learning, because technology has been advancing at a very rapid speed. Our abilities to learn and grow is how we will change the industry, whether that is in automotive or elsewhere.

The digital technology to manage a car has moved from traditional GPS tracking to new telematics devices.
With the help of car telematics devices drivers can improve their driving style, maintain the vehicle’s efficiency, save on fuel and maintenance costs, and always stay connected with their cars.
Telematics devices installed in the car track the engine’s health, the driving behaviour and provide real-time analytics.
The in-vehicle devices collect data such as speed of the car, how the accelerator is used, how frequently hard brakes are applied, the car’s location, when and where it was started and turned off, and the engine’s cooling and heating. These devices also send emergency and security alerts in case of a breakdown or accident.

Telematics devices, which work on the cellular network, compile the data and send it to a centralized server. After which an automated analysis based on certain parameters is done and a performance report is generated, which car owners can check on their mobile app.
The performance report, generated fortnightly or monthly, tells car owners how well they managed the vehicle and provide solutions for improved management.
Amit Upadhyay, CTO of Rollr, subsidiary of auto components maker Samvardhana Motherson Group, said, “There are numerous benefits of car telematics devices as these can tell us about car health, location of the vehicle, and driving behaviour. Through in-vehicle telematics data, the car maintenance cost can be reduced and driving skills can be improved.”
“Unlike western countries, in India vehicle telematics data is not linked to motor insurance yet, but this could happen in the near future,” he added.
Various in-vehicle telematics devices such as Rollr Mini and Suzuki Connect are available in the market. Telematics equipment can also help in recovery of stolen vehicles.

Sharedmobility.news asks Dr. Eric Bruun, about ride sharing, blockchain, road congestion and others super interesting topics….
 
1-Why is the ride sharing tech a key technology for the automotive industry?
I don’t think it was their idea, but they have seen the importance of joining in with other elements of the transport industry.  
I think it has become clear to them that a good portion of auto use in the future will be “power by the hour,” a term I borrowed from the US rail freight industry where they rent locomotives.
I would distinguish ride sharing from car sharing.  The ride sharing market will call for vans around 10 seats for multiple parties, while car sharing will use smaller vehicles aimed at one party, not sharing with strangers.

 
2- What will be the role of blockchain in the future of transportation?
Who can say for sure? It is a nascent technology without historical analogues, unlike some of the allegedly new ride-share modes that are in fact very similar to long existing modes.
 Uber and Lyft, for example, have cost structures very close to traditional taxis and are paid for with the traditional means of credit cards. 
I suspect that blockchains will go a long way towards addressing the reservations and payment problems preventing the availability of shared-ride modes to those without official government ID or traditional bank accounts. 
This lack of ID and money is common even in the USA, but certainly even more true for the vast majority of persons living in developing countries. 
With blockchains, an individual might be able to establish their identities unofficially and reuse it. 
For those without cash in the bank or credit cards, shared rides could perhaps be paid by stored value. 
This stored value might be obtained by bartering other goods or services. In this way, transport services become more fungible.  
 
3-What do you think is the solution for road congestion?
There is often no real solution to congestion, at least as long as fuel is readily available. Latent demand typically reveals itself when congestion is (temporarily) reduced. 
In this case, congestion has to be managed.
 We can do this by pricing by time of day and location. 
A more blunt way is to restrict the entrance to especially congested areas by charging a flat fee. 
Pricing becomes more practical and easy to administer as MaaS applications become more widespread.
 Price levels can also readily be adjusted as demand curves reveal themselves over time.
I favor making public transport lanes from existing general use lanes, which could in most cases also include shared-ride vehicles carrying more than X persons, X to be determined on a case basis. 
In this way, there is an incentive to use more space-efficient modes. 
This also gives travelers some options which at least have reliable travel times, even if not always as fast as traveling in a single
 occupant vehicle. MaaS applications make the performance of these choices easier to compare.  
But technology cannot solve everything. 
There will still need to be a political commitment to allocate parts of the city to the most space-efficient modes and enforce restrictions and access. 
Again, with widespread MaaS applications, minimum vehicle sizes and minimum passenger load factors can readily be adjusted. 
 
4- Will the big auto companies become mobility companies?
They already are moving in this direction.
 At least three have already invested in either shared ride or MaaS, or both, as a way of helping to steer the development and product offerings for urban and inner suburban mobility.
 But, in reality, they will most likely remain primarily hardware manufacturers. 
Much of their market is still outer suburbs and rural applications where people will retain private vehicles much as today.
However, I could be wrong. Perhaps there could prove to be more profit from commissions on selling mobility segments than in hardware. 
 The financial sector has higher profit margins than manufacturing, which tends to be extremely competitive and global.
 The outcome will depend on who else enters the market of MaaS operators and how quickly market share is established.
 Smaller unaffiliated private MaaS operators could be seen as more impartial providers of information and choices, while public transport agencies, and city/regional governments might expect much lower commissions. 
 
5- Will the driver experience disappear any time soon?
There will be limited replacement of drivers, but it will take a long time even in the richest of countries to be fully automated in significant portions of any city.
 In less developed countries, traffic is far too chaotic and people too impoverished to buy automated vehicles in large numbers in the foreseeable future. 
It is also true that many people enjoy driving, perhaps not always, but much of the time. They may not be so anxious to pay extra for automation features.

 
The biggest unknown is not the speed of technology development, but government acceptance of automated vehicles mixed in traffic with manually driven and non-motorized vehicles.
If it becomes apparent that roadway capacity is actually reduced under mixed manual and automated vehicles, or that some pedestrians and bicycles will freely move in front of automated vehicles knowing they must stop, cities will resist. 
Banning driven vehicles and putting up fences along busy streets to keep out the non-motorized would not be vote getters for elected officials.  
 
6- Will the cars be replaced one day by bikes in the big cities?
This will happen to some extent where riding conditions have improved. 
Electric bikes will also increase use in hilly cities and when cargo is carried, and this should be encouraged. But they are not a full replacement for larger vehicles.
Distances can be too long, weather too adverse, many people will be unable or unwilling to ride, and so on.
As with cars, not everyone will want to replace their own bike with a shared one. 
Carrying bikes along on larger vehicles is particularly promising as an extender of fixed route public transport.
 Bikes can also be an extender into exclusion zones or locations with very high parking prices for private autos. 
 Thus, I suspect that public transport vehicles and cars will both have increasing provision for people to bring along their own bikes. 
We are also already seeing the downside from too many ride-shared bicycles.
 In Chinese cities with free entry for bike sharing companies, there is a backlash against bicycles locked and abandoned or stripped of parts blighting neighborhoods.  
Appropriate regulation, not just of bicycles, but all shared ride modes, will take some time to develop and disseminate through the public sector. 
The aim is to have an appropriate balance of short response times and convenience from many vehicles with the reduced mutual congestion and improved financial viability from fewer vehicles.

It doesn’t seem like the transportation industry could be completely disrupted by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Of course, the idea of both Lyft and Uber dominating local transportation industries across the globe seemed laughable a decade ago too.
Truly innovative technology always finds a way to seep into every aspect of our lives.
We already discussed how the blockchain is changing shipping and commercial transport of goods, but travel and consumer transport are very different industries. In fact, travel and tourism account for 10.4 percent of the global GDP.

No discussion of travel and transportation would be complete without the topic of blockchain technology. From ride sharing to municipal transportation, air travel, car rentals, and car sales, everything’s coming up blockchain.
The Blockchain-based Ride-sharing Economy
The basic ride-sharing economy created by Uber and Lyft are the most likely marketplaces to be attacked by blockchain-based startups. Although these companies save hundreds of millions of dollarsby classifying drivers as independent contractors, they truly work more like employees.
Like independent entrepreneurs who depend on services like Etsy, eBay, and Amazon to get products in front of customers, drivers depend on these two services. Uber basically acts like a marketplace that connects drivers to passengers.
Blockchain-based startup Arcade City thinks the blockchain is powerful enough to squeeze market share away from these historic unicorn companies that already disrupted an established industry. By accepting crypto payments and decentralizing the marketplace, this new app appeals not only to rideshare drivers, but to crypto miners.
Instead of electricity, you’d be trading your time and gasoline to earn ETH. Of course, Arcade City has a long way to go in balancing the supply and demand issues that come with building a two-sided marketplace. And it’s not the only blockchain headed in that direction either.
Chen Weixing, founder of Kuaidi Dache, Uber’s Chinese-based competitor, announced in mid-2018 an intent to build a blockchain-based Uber.
There’s plenty of reason to believe people want this solution. Uber is notorious for data issues, with a 2016 breach exposing the personal information of 20 million users and not being reported publicly until 2018. It also has to submit to regular FTC audits after it was revealed the company had a hidden “god mode” that let drivers stalk passengers.
A blockchain-based ride-hailing marketplace can be more secure, traceable, and efficient. And that’s just one place crypto is hitting the transportation industry.
Crypto Planes, Trains, and Automobiles
Car rental companies are set to compete with HireGo, a blockchain-based car rental startup that uses its proprietary ERC-20 HGO token to pay for car rentals in a peer-to-peer marketplace. Turo and several other companies are also competing in the peer-to-peer car rental space, and none has gotten the traction of Uber or Lyft yet.

Bus fare is one of the most-wanted uses of cryptos, with over half of people responding to a recent survey saying they believe they’ll pay bus far in crypto within a decade.
Two major bus companies in Brazil, Basil Sul and Viacao Garcia, are accepting BTC payments for bus fares. China’s largest electric bus operator recently struck a $24 billion three-year deal with Seven Stars Cloud Group to overhaul its finance services using blockchain technology.
By trusting blockchain with ticketing, bus depots from municipal to cross-country can better track vehicles for maintenance, charge passengers, route stops, and more. Train operators can benefit much the same way. Testing is currently underway in Russia on better railway supply tracking using blockchain, and it’s only a matter of time before more of the industry converts.
Blockchain-based vehicle tracking is of interest to airline companies like Lufthansa too. Not only is the technology great for airplane maintenance, but crypto is ideal for airline loyalty programs, as Singapore Airlines proved with its blockchain-based KrisFlyer program.
Expedia may have recently shunned Bitcoin, but the rest of the travel industry is on board the blockchain. Some blockchain bros are even boarding cruises.
Technology is the root of our transportation industry, and industry leaders in each section are quickly waking up to the effects blockchain will have on their industries.

It’s no secret that in just a few years, our cars will be able to take us wherever we want to while we relax. That could potentially enhance our quality of life considerably. It may sound fictional or imaginary, but the autonomous vehicle revolution is underway. 
The fact that self-driving cars have already started being produced is quite impressive. The future of transportation is bright, and self-driving cars are blazing the path. But amid all of the buzz you may be wondering, how do self-driving cars work?

Many cars today are actually semi-autonomous already. Some have features like self-parking.
Completely autonomous cars are entering the scene. Tesla has already started selling autonomous solutions, and Google is planning to drop an autonomous vehicle product line on the market by 2020.
To Err is Human
So, why autonomous cars? A recent study has shown that over 90 percent of road accidents are caused by human error. To err is human, but behind the wheel, mistakes are often catastrophic. Accidents have led to a massive number of unnecessary deaths—lives that could have otherwise been saved through safer driving. This is where self-driving cars come in. What do they have to offer?

Autonomous cars are much safer than human-driven cars. They’re unaffected by factors like driver fatigue, emotion, or illness. This makes them very safe.
Self-driving cars are always attentive and active, observing their environments and scanning multiple directions. It would be difficult to make a move that the car has not anticipated.
Adoption of self-driving cars would mean safer roadways, which in turn would mean less demand for emergency response services, pricey insurance premiums, not to mention savings in accident-related health care for everyone.

How Do Self-Driving Cars Work?
The technological leaps and bounds we have made in recent years have finally culminated in making self-driving cars a reality. Self-driving cars are only possible today due to the existence of three technologies:
1: IoT Sensors
There are many types of sensors available today that make autonomous cars a reality. Sensors for blind-spot monitoring, forward collision warning, radar, camera, LIDAR, and ultrasonic all work together to make navigation of a self-driving car possible.
2: IoT Connectivity
Self-driving cars use cloud computing to act upon traffic data, weather, maps, adjacent cars, and surface conditions among others. This helps them monitor their surroundings better and make informed decisions. Self-driving cars must be connected to the internet even if edge computing hardware can solve small computing tasks locally.
3: Software Algorithms
All the data the car collects needs to be analyzed to determine the best course of action. This is the main function of the control algorithms and software. This is the most complex part of the self-driving car since it has to make decisions flawlessly. A “flaw,” like in Uber’s self-driving accident, can be fatal.
Google and Tesla Lead the Charge
The most famous self-driving cars in existence today are those made by Tesla and Google. Tesla cars work by analyzing their environments using a software system known as “Autopilot“.
Autopilot uses high-tech cameras to view and collect data on the world, much like we use our eyes to do, using what’s called “computer vision” or sophisticated image recognition. It then interprets this information and makes the best decision based on it. As stated earlier, Tesla’s self-driving technology is already being sold today.

On the other hand, Google takes a very different approach to its cars.
The self-driving cars Google makes use LIDAR. Simply put, lidar is like radar, but with light instead of radio waves. This sensor technology makes Google’s cars bypass the need for steering wheels and pedals.
We began this article with the question, how do self-driving cars work? Let’s end it with another: what obstacles still stand in the way for self-driving cars?








The path towards self-driving cars, like all great breakthroughs, is littered with obstacles. Some of these hurdles are technological but many more are political and regulatory. Self-driving cars are illegal—often by default—in many US states. Another hurdle developers face is how to safely integrate the cars into a world of human-driven vehicles. Remember, it’s humans who make mistakes.








The fact that we’re looking at the mainstream adoption of autonomous vehicle technology by 2020 is pretty amazing. The technology could change all of our lives whether we own a self-driving car or not. Our society can definitely benefit from autonomous vehicles, in areas such as driving privileges for the old and the physically impaired.
Soon, everyone will be able to own a self-driving car. We can hope that there’ll be fewer crazy drivers on our roads soon.

Over the past decade or so, the technology industry has transformed many things we used to buy as physical products into digital services we subscribe to or access on a pay-per-use basis.
Think about how we have moved from buying CDs towards paying a monthly subscription to use Spotify, or the shift from DVDs to Netflix.
Could cars be the next part of everyday life to be transformed from a physical product into an on-demand service? Some technologists and economists predict that the privately-owned car will go the way of the horse and buggy within in a decade.
In their view, only motor enthusiasts and the rich will one day own personal cars, which they will use for leisure rather than transportation.
One study in the US, for example, forecasts that private car ownership will fall by as much 80% by 2030 and that using electric ride-shares will be four to 10 times cheaper than buying a new car by 2021.
The researchers foresee a world where communal, autonomous (self-driving) electric cars owned by cities or ride-sharing companies offer a safe, efficient and flexible personal transportation system.

We’re already at the beginning of this revolution, with ride-hailing services like Uber and Taxify already potentially cheaper for some people than owning a car.
Car sharing services such as Zipcar – which enables you to subscribe by the month and then hire a car by the hour – and Turo – an Airbnb-like service that matches car owners with car renters – have also started to pop up around the world.
MyTreasury.co.za crunched the basic numbers and found using Uber could be more cost-effective on a per-kilometre basis for people in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban who travel less than 50 kilometres a day.
The reason for this is that you pay only for the distance you travel, without the costs of car ownership such as maintenance, insurance, financing, licences, and depreciation.
One also needs to add to the lifestyle costs. How much of your time do you spend stuck in traffic or looking for parking? What if you could be making calls and working on your computer during your commute instead of sitting at the wheel?

A recent report on the global artificial intelligence (AI) talent pool estimates that there are fewer than 10,000 people worldwide with the competencies necessary to undertake advanced research in AI.
With demand for talent outpacing supply, U of T Engineering continues to create opportunities to prepare engineers to lead and contribute their expertise in this booming field. On Nov. 22, alumni working in data analytics and AI are coming back to Skule™ to network with current graduate students and discuss careers in the industry. Experts on new approaches and emerging applications for AI will share their diverse experiences in areas from blockchain to telecommunications.
Alice Gong (EngSci 1T7+PEY) is one of nine alumni sharing her insights. Gong is a software engineer at General Motors (GM), where her work in AI is advancing GM’s research toward semi-autonomous, hands-free driving on highways.
Gong was among the first class to graduate from U of T Engineering’s robotics major in Engineering Science, and was also part of aUToronto, the award-winning student team working to turn an electric vehicle fully autonomous as part of the three-year international Autodrive Challenge.

Gong recently spoke with Liz Do to share her career journey so far, and how she applied her U of T Engineering experience into a career in data analytics and AI.
What sparked your interest in autonomous vehicles?
I initially wanted to do a biomedical engineering major, but then the robotics major had just launched at U of T Engineering and I thought, why not try it. Studying the major made me want to dig deeper into robotics and all aspects of programming. This led me to pursue my Professional Experience Year Co-op Program (PEY Co-op) at Zebra Technologies.
Reading and learning on my commute on public transit brought me lots of growth, but its schedule constraints also annoyed me, which made me think more about self-driving cars. I then went on to join aUToronto, and this further developed my interest in autonomous driving and led me onto my current role at General Motors.
What do you do at GM?
I’m working to further develop Super Cruise technology at GM. Super Cruise is an assistive-driving technology, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel on mapped, divided highways. It’s semi-autonomous because there is still a camera that monitors drivers’ eyes to keep them engaged – you can’t just go to the back and read a book yet.
A lot of companies’ efforts into creating semi-autonomous or autonomous driving technologies have faced challenges, such as the risk for car accidents due to a driver’s lack of attention. Our technology makes sure that drivers can only enable the function when they are actually on the highway – which is a controlled environment without stop signs or pedestrians.
My particular work is currently on global localization of a vehicle on our high-definition maps to enable more active safety and navigation features in the future. Right now, this technology is only in one high-end model of Cadillacs but we will definitely extend the coverage in the future. It’s an exciting time to be in the automotive industry.
How has data analytics changed your industry?
 I see that a lot of potential ideas have been inspired by the tech industry, and that the automotive industry is keen to innovate and make use of advanced theories. An existing example is the implementation of Waze, which crowd-sources traffic data to help drivers avoid traffic and get home sooner — crowd-sourcing makes heavy use of data analytics knowledge.
The automotive industry is starting to realize that we can use data and AI to improve the experience of our day-to-day travels, and our team is already working towards many future features inspired by it.

Why is it important for graduate students to prepare themselves in the area of data analytics and AI?
There are already many senior engineers who have worked in this industry for decades. When junior engineers, like me, join the automotive industry, we have a lot of experience to gain, but at the same time we can provide insights into cutting-edge algorithms, new technologies, new ways to solve problems. This is definitely the case if you are graduating with the deep knowledge of robotics, or machine learning or AI.
Being able to implement algorithms in the most efficient and robust ways are even more important than ideas themselves, because the products you build are not just for experiments – there will be costs to the company and possibly to society if it fails. Solid implementation skills like coding are not just the means to an end, it’s what turns a dream into reality.
I think it’s also more important than ever for our generation to continue to build their unique perspectives and stay at the cutting edge with life-long learning, because technology has been advancing at a very rapid speed. Our abilities to learn and grow is how we will change the industry, whether that is in automotive or elsewhere.

After incurring hefty losses for more than a year, oBike ceased operations in Singapore on June 25. Though other players have exited the scene, oBike is the only member of the Big Three – Mobike and ofo are the other two – to have done so.
oBike’s exit raises several questions about the future of the sector and the possible strategies that players might adopt.

One question that arises is the feasibility of the bike-sharing business model in Singapore, especially after the impending implementation of new regulations, which will require them to be licensed by the Land Transport Authority and have their fleet size regulated by it, among other things.




I believe that Singapore provides a conducive environment for bike-sharing companies for several reasons: The population density is high, income levels are high, but car-ownership is relatively low, the weather is generally favorable (e.g., no snow which would make bike-riding hazardous), and sidewalks are paved well and generally clear for safe bike-riding.

These factors probably attracted bike-sharing companies, and the fierce battle that has ensued has taken its toll on the profitability of the players.
The new regulations will certainly impose steep costs, especially because of the registration fees to be paid for each bike in the fleet and also the potential fines that may be incurred if the bikes litter the landscape.
But they may also be viewed as a blessing in disguise by the bike-sharing firms.
There are several reasons for this. Over the last few weeks, a few firms have already announced that they would discontinue operations because of the new regulations, thus potentially easing the downward pressure on prices.
Having fewer players may also mean that their fleets are utilised well, subject to factors such as pricing and the utility offered to customers.
In the past, because there were no registration charges, bike-sharing firms might have maintained larger than optimal fleet sizes, thus imposing higher costs on themselves – for bikes that were lying idle, for instance.
A smaller fleet size, combined with regulatory restrictions, will also allow better churn of bikes and a lower likelihood of vandalism to the bikes, since vehicles which are not sitting idle in the open for too long are less likely to be vandalized.
On the other hand, firms will have to come up with new technological solutions to prevent users from parking the bikes indiscriminately.
If they do not already have this technology, developing it will impose an additional cost. Fines may add up as well, and may be difficult to predict, especially in the early days of the new regulatory regime.
While the possibility of collecting data has been mentioned often in discussions about bike-sharing firms’ strategies, I believe the data is mostly useful for the companies to optimise their operations.
Occasionally, the data may be useful to other parties, such as telcos, which can use it to pinpoint gaps in their coverage, for example.
However, I cannot envisage a situation in which the data could be converted into significant revenue opportunities.
In future, there may be opportunities to generate additional revenues through advertising, but this opportunity will only manifest itself (if it exists at all) over time.
In other words, bike-sharing firms must find a way to recover most (if not all) of their costs through the prices they charge, at least in the near future.
edf
They must do this while not impacting usage significantly, because the demand for the service is likely to be price-elastic.
From the user’s perspective, prices are likely to go up as the operators incur additional costs because of the new rules, and also since the firms would seek to build a buffer against potential fines.
Most importantly, if users are restricted in terms of parking, the utility of the service may go down—for instance, if the distance between the geo-fenced parking area and a user’s destination is significant.
In the past, one of the biggest conveniences of bike-sharing was that a user could park the bike anywhere.
On the other hand, users may not be required to pay a deposit to the bike-sharing companies, and thus need not worry about losing their deposits if the company folds.
The bike-sharing industry in Singapore may be considered akin to an experimental lab. Bike-sharing companies might discover technologies and business models that they may be able to transplant elsewhere in Asia.
Singapore’s regulators may arrive at an optimal regulatory regime after some trial and error, which may also be useful for other services that may arise in the future — PMD-sharing services, for one, which now exist in limited form.
The authorities are likely to want to encourage bike-sharing, but not while it imposes significant externalities, such as a littered landscape.
Users might do well to remember that the regulatory regime, as well as business models, might evolve, and yesterday’s policies and strategies may be very different in future.
Recent developments, and those to follow, will thus mean there are exciting and interesting times ahead for all stakeholders in this industry.

Like it or not, Artificial Intelligence is the technology for the future, and it has a lot of use cases. Right now, smartphone makers are using AI in camera apps to make photography easier for users and according to Uber, the ride sharing app will use AI tech to tell if a rider is taking a business or personal trip.
This isn’t the first time we’ve heard of Uber tapping AI to improve its app and user experience. Previously, the company had applied for a patent that could tell if a ride was drunk or sober. If the app identified the rider as drunk, then it would provide warnings to the driver, and better options for the customers.
Now, the company will be using machine learning and AI to determine if a user is taking a business trip, or a pleasure trip. Sometimes, things get mixed up, and a business trip could be charged to the riders personal card.
This is usually a mistake by the rider, wherein, they forget to change their payment method to business. And that is always a problem especially, if it is a long ride to a meeting etc. Therefore, using AI technology, Uber wants to get rid of this issue.

Of course, it will not work all the time, but Uber promises that eight out of 10 times the app should be able to tell if it is a business or leisure ride.
Uber is calling this ‘Profile recommendations’ and all this comes under Uber for Business. A lot of companies use Uber to provide transport for its employees, where the bill is sent to the company’s account.
With this new tech, Uber will be able to predict the payment method that the customer should be using, even if the rider forgets to change it. The app will then recommend this to the user with a pop-up while booking a ride. Uber, using machine learning, will sort through several billion trips a year to analyse patterns that can reveal the purpose behind a trip.
Like we mentioned earlier, the feature and the app have been right about 80 percent of the time in preliminary tests. However, in-case the app is wrong in choosing the payment method for the trip, it will always show up a pop-up asking if its recommendation was right. The user will have an option to confirm thus, giving the final power to the human part of the equation.
Apart from this, Uber for Business is also getting other new features that will help travel managers with a new feature called ‘trip reviewers’ and ‘in-app trip resolution’. All of these will make it easier for employees and employers to use Uber as their ride sharing app.
The app will also be adding several new Expense Integrations. Business users have use a certain expense provider that takes care of their trip bills, and now there will be more to choose from.
Uber is adding providers such as Expensya, Happay, Rydoo, Zeno by Serko and Zoho Expense. These will be launched in September 2018 and employees will be able to directly send their bills to their respective platforms.

London’s Gatwick Airport has rolled out a carpooling service that provides airport’s employees with preferential parking spaces and tracks their associated reduction in vehicle miles and emissions in real-time.
Gatwick claims to be the first airport in the world to launch this carpooling service, which offers staff who give lifts to colleagues preferential airport parking via a smartphone app.
Launched in collaboration with journey sharing platform Faxi, the new service gathers data from each shared journey using a smartphone app. The data is used to incentivise drivers with access to preferential parking bays in their existing car park.

“Faxi allows our staff to not only save money and share travel costs but also reduce their car emissions and traffic on local roads at the same time.”

The Faxi app shows users other staff on their route and the potential diversion from their normal route (in minutes) for pick-up that enables drivers to fill their vehicle with passengers.

Every shared journey is verified so that vehicle miles and subsequent reduction in emissions are tracked and recorded.
Staff can also considerably slash their fuel costs and even ‘afford a new car’ with the money saved on fuel and associated costs.
Gatwick Airport car parking head Gary Wallace said: “I am pleased to announce Gatwick is partnering with Faxi as the airport continues to expand its portfolio of sustainable travel and parking schemes for both passengers and staff at the airport.
“Faxi allows our staff to not only save money and share travel costs but also reduce their car emissions and traffic on local roads at the same time, which once again demonstrates Gatwick’s commitment to being the UK’s most environmentally friendly airport.”
The new plan’s environmental benefit supports the airport’s commitment to operate in a sustainable way and achieve its ambition to be the UK’s most sustainable airport.

CAR-SHARING schemes are becoming more popular but in most cases it still pays to buy your own car, a study by News Corp Australia has revealed.

Motorists who cover the average annual distance travelled — and who don’t have easy access to public transport — are still better off with their own set of wheels rather than renting a car by the hour.
However, people who have the option of catching a bus or a train to work — and only need a car on weekends — are likely better off subscribing to a sharing service.
According to figures verified by finance comparison website Finder.com.au, a $10,000 used car costs an average of $132 per week to run, including loan repayments, petrol, servicing, registration and insurance.
To rent the cheapest vehicle from GoGet, a Toyota Yaris, the weekly costs are between $110 and $121 for 10 hours and 100km of driving (including subscription fees, hourly rates, fuel and distance charges and insurance), or between $150 and $161 for 10 hours and 200km of driving, matching the average distance travelled.


Kim and Jason Graham-Nye say car-sharing works for them but agree it might not add up for everyone. Picture: Richard DobsonSource:News Corp Australia

If you prefer a larger hatchback such as a Toyota Corolla, on the surface it seems as though you’d be better off with car sharing.
A new Corolla valued at $25,000 costs an average of $239.27 per week to run, according to Finder.com.au, including loan repayments, petrol, servicing, registration and insurance.
To rent a Toyota Corolla via the GoGet car-sharing scheme, the weekly costs are between $115 and $126 for 10 hours and 100km, or between $155 and $166 for 10 hours and 200km.
However, one key element overlooked in these calculations is what your car would be worth after three years, once the loan is paid out.

A $10,000 used Toyota Yaris in good condition with low kilometres would be worth about $6000 after three years, and a new Toyota Corolla would be valued about $15,000 at the end of the loan.


You could sell the car, pocket the cash, and start again — or keep the car and slash your annual running costs with only registration, insurance, fuel and servicing to worry about.
In the case of the Yaris, once the loan is paid out its annual running costs would be halved, and in the case of the Toyota Corolla its annual running costs would be slashed by more than two-thirds.
Once the loan is paid out, in both cases buying a car is a better option financially than subscribing to a sharing service if you cover close to the average annual distance travelled of 10,400km.


With our congested streets, Australia’s uptake of car sharing is leading the world, the industry claims. Picture: Joshua Dowling.Source:Supplied

For those who don’t need to travel as far, car sharing works.
Sydney couple Jason and Kim Graham-Nye haven’t owned a car since December 2014, when they began using GoGet.
“I never want to go back to owning a car,” says Kim. “Our needs may change but if it’s up to me I never want to go back to owning a car.”
The couple agree car-sharing isn’t for everyone but it makes sense in their congested suburb.
“You can spend an hour looking for a parking spot on weekends,” says Kim. “We have access to a lot of cars … there are six spots within a four-minute walk. We also use Uber when that’s more convenient. Financially we reckon we’re in front, rather than owning and maintaining a car.”


Laughing all the way to the bank … Kim and Jason Graham-Nye say the cost of car sharing drops to almost zero when they’re away, whereas owning a car would still cost money. Picture: Richard Dobson.Source:News Corp Australia

Husband Jason says not having the ongoing expense of a car is part of the appeal of sharing services.
“When you sit down every month and look at personal finances you can see the savings,” says Jason. “When you go away there’s no ongoing car expense. When you go on holidays the GoGet bill for the month is almost zero.”
The couple concedes car sharing appeals more to people with good access to public transport and who don’t need to travel big distances for work.
They also like the flexibility of vehicle choice.
“If we need a people mover or van — or a convertible for a weekend away — we can get one,” says Jason. “Every now and then it can be hard to get a car when you need it, but if you book in advance it’s locked in.”

From Shanghai to Barcelona bike share programs have become an international phenomenon, so why has Sydney sent multiple bike share operators packing?
Of the four bike sharing companies currently operating in Sydney, two of them, ofo and Reddy Go have announced their departure from the city less than a year after their introduction.
The speedy departure of dockless bike sharing programs will come as a relief to the many Sydneysiders who became sick of seeing heaps of abandoned bicycles littering the streets.
But none will be quite as relieved as Sydney’s councils, which were held financially responsible for disposing of any unclaimed bikes dumped within their respective jurisdictions.
In response to the sweeping issue of bikes strewn across the city, six councils — Canada Bay, City of Sydney, Inner West, Randwick, Waverley and Woollahra — created the “Inner Sydney bike-share guidelines” in March to clarify their expectations of how dockless bike share companies should handle illegally parked bikes.
The Waverley Council area in particular has been heavily impacted by the misuse and abuse of dockless share bikes.

Waverley Council mayor John Wakefield said the Council had impounded 107 share bikes left in public spaces to date, of which about half had been reclaimed prior to the companies announcing that they are leaving the market.
Share bike company ofo collected 52 bikes and paid impound fees of $3640, Mobike collected eight bikes and paid impound fees of $560, and 33 bikes belonging to oBike and 14 belonging to Reddy Go remain unclaimed, Cr Wakefield added.
Australia had one of the poorest responses to bike sharing globally, with the average bike in Sydney being used for 0.3 trips a day as opposed to two to six trips per day in other countries, according to Nine News.
Aside from the vandalism and misplaced bikes, local laws do little to boost bike sharing in Australia.
Cr Wakefield said bike sharing was a great concept, but its success was hindered by the inadequate existing legislation that forced local communities to bear the costs of abandoned bikes.
“Had bike share operators worked closely with the community, and with Council, the opportunity for the schemes to work would have been far greater,” Cr Wakefield said.
Locals seem to think bike sharing in Australia is doomed. One Sydneysider, Dave, explained that the success of share bikes in Australia has been inhibited by the controversy surrounding them, which had made using them less appealing.
“It’s very politically charged,” Dave said.
Another share bike user, Carl, pointed out that there simply isn’t a market in Australia for share bikes.
“Do you see anybody else riding them?” Carl asked, motioning toward the bikeless streets around him. “It’s not going to work. People in Australia just don’t ride bikes.”
Non-locals have become less keen on Australia’s bike share as well. Australia and New Zealand are currently the only two countries in the world that enforce universal use of helmets by cyclists, which the majority of backpackers aren’t used to.
Always needing to have a helmet deters light-packing travellers from properly partaking in bike sharing said James, a visitor from the United States.
“A lot of people from other countries aren’t used to wearing a helmet,” James said. “It’s hard to keep the bike and helmet together, so people just ditch the helmet.”

Another backpacker agreed that the lack of consequences for dumping bikes and helmets wherever they want discourages people from carefully parking bikes appropriately.
Ofo stated that the company was leaving Australia to “focus on priority markets internationally,” implying that there is greater demand for share bikes across other sections of the globe, and indeed there is.
Between 2013 and 2016, the number of bikes available for public use around the world more than tripled from 700,000 to almost 2.3 million, and the numbers continue to grow.
The increasing popularity of opting for bikes in favour of other modes of urban transportation has prompted the rapid expansion of bike share companies in countries such as the United States and China, suggesting that dockless bike sharing could be the way of the future.
Does this mean that Sydney is destined to fall behind the global trends? Not if Cr Wakefield can help it.
“Bike share systems can work, and we certainly don’t want this to be the end of bike share in Australia,” Cr Wakefield said. “What we do want is for better regulation and for better partnerships with these operators, so we can work together for the benefit of the end user, which is the community.”
Cr Wakefield said the council established a Bike Advisory Committee in March that will prioritise bike share and making the area more bike-friendly.
“Cycling is a huge priority for us at Waverley Council, and work begins next month on the much anticipated $12 million Bondi Junction Cycleway,” Cr Wakefield said.
The cycleway is the missing link in the bike route between the eastern suburbs and the CBD, which the council began designing and planning in 2014.
So far, Waverley Council has contributed $2.4 million for the project and works are expected to be completed by late 2020.

With car sharing being all the rage these days, established industry leaders like Uber and Lyft are leading this new transportation paradigm. Other methods of getting around include mass transit via buses and trains and electric scooters and bicycles.
The goal is to reduce single occupancy cars to the extent possible along with their massive external costs including pollution from internal combustion, and the severe overcrowding of roads, freeways, and parking structures. Recently we have discovered a unique way of car sharing that can be used by those with flexible or predictable schedules.
My girlfriend recently moved in with me. She had been driving a Toyota Corolla due to the fact the landlord where she lived previously would not allow her to install a charger. Naturally, I already had a charger installed, so we began looking at our options.

Would we get a new EV, or a used one? As it turned out, another couple in our building had leased a Leaf until the lease ran out.
These good friends of ours split time between Florida and Santa Monica and owned a Chevy Bolt for use in Florida.
They were looking for something to use while in California. After discussing our respective needs for a car, we determined that one car would easily suffice for all our driving needs. The economics of four people sharing a car were too compelling to pass up. Thus was born the idea to share a car.
We met a few times to go over the title, insurance, scheduling, and how to handle issues related to damage. It should go without saying that trust and communication between the partners is important. Also, physical proximity is very helpful.
We looked at both the Leaf and Bolt since the 2018 Leaf at 150 miles range would easily serve our needs. The Bolt with about 50% more range was overkill, but more range is never a bad thing. So, it came down to price.
I had worked for four years selling the Leaf from it’s introduction in 2010 until 2014 when I retired. I thought the Leaf would be a good deal since it was limited in range relative to the Bolt and that Nissan would be offering a longer range Leaf the next year.
I thought these two things would enable us to negotiate a very low price since Nissan would want to move these cars and make room for the next iteration. Sadly, the residual on the lease was set too low making the monthly payment considerably higher than we wanted to pay.
We had a wonderful buying experience. Our previous efforts resulted in monthly lease costs in the high $300’s which was not where we wanted to be.  David Eagle of Current EV came to our rescue and delivered with a quote we couldn’t refuse for 10,000 miles on a 3 year lease from  Camino Real Chevrolet [CN1].
The service provided by the dealership was phenomenal, rather than us driving through brutal LA traffic, the dealership delivered the car to our door and David met with us to help with the paperwork.

We have been thoroughly enjoying our Bolt for a few weeks now. Our car partners created a shared calendar that we use to schedule trips so we all know well in advance of the other’s needs.
Our share, including lease, insurance costs, and energy, is considerably less than what my girlfriend was spending with her gas car and we get to ride in style.
With the range of the Bolt, and our short commutes, we can always go the distance.  If you want to save even more money check with your utility company to find out more about charging during off-peak hours.
While our needs are different from most daily commuters who use a car every day, I’m certain there are many people who might be able to share ownership of a vehicle. Whether it’s a used or new EV, this method of car sharing is a terrific way to keep your transportation costs to a bare minimum and to reduce your contribution to climate change and pollution.

Buses, America’s main mode of public transit, are often overlooked because of their perceived inefficiencies and the overall downward ridership trend. Reports of falling public transit ridership in cities across the U.S. seem to appear every day. So, why aren’t people riding buses, and what can be done to bring them back?
Solving the problem is a lot simpler than most transit agencies might think. There are several easy ways to modernize bus service without needing to completely overhaul system infrastructure, but first we must look at how we got to this point.
WHERE DID THE RIDERS GO?
It’s difficult to pinpoint an exact cause for the fall in bus ridership, as the transportation ecosystem in most cities increasingly includes a diverse and expansive arsenal of transit options, such as dockless bikes and e-scooters, but there is no doubt that fewer people are riding buses.

While external causes are undoubtedly having an effect, most major bus systems also need updates and upgrades to entice riders back. There are first/last-mile deficiencies in most cities to get riders to and from major transit hubs efficiently.
This is an area where ride-share companies, such as Uber and Lyft among others, have stepped in to get riders from the less-dense suburbs to the bustling metro systems in downtowns. But that’s also a core function of bus service. Buses reduce congestion and they can carry up to 40 people, which means there’s up to 40 fewer cars on the road.
Riders choose their mode of transit based on convenience, more so than price or other factors. This helps explain why buses may be losing out to other mobility options that make it easy to get from point A to B. Bus systems across the U.S. have been unfairly described as “ancient,” “broken” and “antiquated.” It’s no wonder riders are moving to easy-to-use options.
Some bus systems have inefficient routes because of changing roadway landscapes and new congestion patterns. Others have inconvenient payment options, meaning riders have to go out of their way to purchase tickets or have cash with them in order to ride, causing long wait times at stops.
Some systems are unreliable and riders are left waiting for a late bus that they have no way to track, so they end up choosing a different option to get to their destination on time. All of these issues point to an overarching problem: buses just aren’t as convenient to use as riders expect. For transit agencies looking to boost ridership, there are several ways to improve the situation.
THE IMPACT OF MODERNIZATION PLUS CONVENIENCE
When trying to improve bus systems to entice new riders, transit agencies should look to a few simple improvements that will boost convenience. These changes can be implemented in a short timeline and require a much lower fiscal commitment than larger infrastructure overhauls, yet they can provide immediate benefits for riders that will make the bus much more appealing.
Real-time tracking of vehicles can deliver a more convenient experience, especially in the age of ride-share where riders have become conditioned to expect constant information about the location of their vehicle as well as the estimated time of arrival at the final destination. If someone needs to ensure they arrive at a specific time, it’s easy to see why they would not ride a bus system without live vehicle tracking.
Buses must contend with traffic and other delays and, without real-time tracking, riders are left guessing when the next bus will arrive and, in turn, when they will get to their destination. For anyone commuting to work or an appointment, this uncertainty is both stressful and inconvenient.
Transit agencies can leverage vehicle tracking, an already proven technology, quickly. This data can then be shared with riders through any number of journey-planning apps, including Transit, Google Maps and others.
The next step is to provide riders with comprehensive journey planning, allowing them to map their entire trip in a single app while showing travel options ranging from buses and the subway to ride-share and bike-share. With access to pre-planned routes that combine multiple modes of transportation in one app, riders can easily choose their journey based on speed, price or other considerations.

Buses are often falsely considered a slow mode of transit, but if riders are able to see how a bus can easily connect them with other forms of transit to reach their destination faster or how the journey time of a bus route compares to other options, they can make more informed choices and are likely to use buses when they are convenient.
Riders need to be able to track and map their journeys and should also focus on in-ride experiences that will add convenience, such as those that allow them to pay for their rides without cash or needing to refill a payment card at a vending machine.
Since most bus stops are located far from transit hubs, they tend to lack ticket vending machines. If a rider doesn’t have a ticket or loaded smart card, they must pay with cash. If someone is not carrying cash — something that is increasingly more common — or only has large bills and won’t be able to get change, they are likely to seek out an alternate form of transit even if it is less efficient or more expensive.
Riders who are able to pay via their phone, in a branded agency app or in the same app they mapped and tracked their journey, will find a bus ride can be easier and more convenient than other options.
Other in-ride improvements include dedicated bus lanes and all-door boarding, which will speed up loading times and reduce delays. Alternatives to cash and paper ticketing make all-door boarding more feasible and require minimal infrastructure changes or improvements.
Transit agencies should be concerned by declining bus ridership, and it’s clear that agencies around the country are already searching for solutions to bring back riders. Major system infrastructure overhauls and new routes are great strategies, but can be time-consuming and costly.
With riders mainly choosing their mode of transit based on convenience, there are simpler ways to modernize and meet this expectation that will make a difference to riders quickly and efficiently.
The future of public transit, with private and public transport options seamlessly connected, should help move people away from private car journeys, allowing the public bus to play a key role in the future of transportation.

Monday’s announcement Canberra’s first dockless bike share scheme trial is about to begin will spark a lively, probably even colourful, community debate.
That’s because few subjects can match bicycles for their power to generate controversy within the Territory.
Then there is the chequered history of bike sharing schemes in other Australian cities and the ongoing debate over the future of public transport, including the roles of cars, light rail, buses and bicycles in the ACT.
Until now the place of bikes in our daily transport mix has been the realm of owner riders who have fallen into two camps.
The first are the die hards who undertake almost epic daily round trips from the outer suburbs to their place of work regardless of the time of year or the weather.
The second are the people who drive to a “park and ride” facility before pedalling to the office. As well as getting some wholesome fresh air and exercise they also save a fortune on parking fees.





A bonus for both has always been that once at their destination they have access to their two-wheeler for short trips.








Add to shortlist

The major benefit of a bike share arrangement, such as the one about to be trialled by Airbike from July 30, is it allows anybody, whether they came in by car, bus or, in the future, by tram, to do the same for $1.30 per 30 minutes.
Airbike users, like existing cycle commuters, also stand to benefit from the significant investment the ACT Government has made in cycle paths and related infrastructure.
This investment, which reflects the fact Canberra’s topography makes it bike-friendly and has contributed to a high level of recreational cycling, lends itself to the Airbike model.


That infrastructure, coupled with the estimated 26 per cent of people who could be willing and able to use a bicycle for short trips even if they don’t bring their own wheels to work, is why bike share stands a better chance of succeeding here than probably anywhere else in the country.
What Airbikes and the ACT Government need to be wary of is this might not be enough to offset the vandalism and haphazard, and dangerous, dumping of bikes in public places, that have beset similar schemes elsewhere.
Sydney, for example, just this month saw Reddy Go announce it was pulling out of the market.  The news came days after Chinese bike share giant Ofo said it was closing down all its Australian operations.
oBike, a Singapore-based company has already closed its Melbourne operation following tough new regulations imposed by Victoria’s Environment Protection Authority.
All of these companies had suffered a public and regulatory backlash against their operations with six Sydney councils forming an alliance to impose strict new guidelines last December.


These included mandating shifting dangerously dumped bikes within three hours; having a manned repair service; being available to unlock bikes when requested by ordnance officers; ensuring all bikes had bells, helmets, lights, reflectors and kick-stands; and having public liability insurance.
The only way to guarantee Airbike succeeds in Canberra is to address these issues from day one and to ensure all share bike users act responsibly.

School’s out for summer. As teens rejoice everywhere, moms and dads face the daunting task of adding being a taxi driver to the list of parental duties. Oh, the sunshine and long days!
But also the sunshine and long days of keeping your teens entertained.

And summer is often when they start nagging you to get their own learner’s licence.
Before now, you were faced with dead ends—figuratively speaking. If you didn’t own a car, you simply couldn’t teach your kids. If you use carshare, they weren’t allowed to drive them. And if you did choose to buy a car or you already owned your own, you’d then have to pay a hefty sum and risk your clean-driving record.
But before you get heart palpitations at the thought of your kid driving, there is an alternative, which is both safe and affordable—whether you have your own car or not.
That’s because, for the first time in North America, our very own local carshare, Modo, has made it possible for young learners to take the wheel.
While other carshare operators require drivers aged 19 or over with an N licence, Modo’s new and inclusive Green Program puts teens aged 16 or older—with an L licence—in the driver’s seat.
This new initiative, which launched on July 1, means you can also enjoy all the great benefits that come with carsharing. It’s more sustainable, convenient, and affordable while also making learning and driving accessible to your teen.
And surely there could not be a better time than now to get some practise in.
Below, we list all the reasons why you’ll want your teen to use carshare to get driving this summer.
Modo is the first carsharing company in North America to open the door to learner drivers and hopes that this move will inspire the next generation to consider carsharing over car ownership.MODO
It’s affordable
Modo members pay about $600 a year to use the service, compared to the average cost of $9,500 to own and operate a vehicle in the Lower Mainland. Under the new program, Green members aged 16 or older with an L licence can be added to a primary member’s Modo Plus (shareholding) account if they live at the same address and the primary member is 25+ with a full licence.
And having access to 600 Modo vehicles across the Lower Mainland, Vancouver Island, and the Okanagan means you can practise with your teen along with a handful of professional lessons instead of doling out hundreds of dollars for practise hours solely with a driving school.
Furthermore, you can benefit from the best insurance possible—$5 million of third-party liability—without having to pay the hefty premium to insure your teen on your own personal car.
Not to mention the expense of gas and repairs.
It’s safe and local
With a mixture of professional lessons and lots of practise with Mom and Dad, you know that your teen is learning to drive in the best possible way.
And since Modo is a co-op, your dollars are going toward supporting a local, member-owned business, which helps with local economic and social growth.
It’s convenient and flexible.
Once your teen has got their licence, they can help with the driving duties without commandeering your car and without the expense of buying them their own.
There’s also the flexibility in making sure you get the type of vehicle you need: Modo has pick-up trucks, SUVs, and minivans.
Every Modo takes approximately nine to 13 private vehicles off the road.MODO
It’s sustainable
In the next 20 years, Metro Vancouver is expected to welcome another one million residents, which will translate into an additional 700,000 privately owned cars, at today’s rate of vehicle ownership. Scary stuff if you think about how bad traffic, congestion, and parking are already.
So with population and car ownership on the rise, carshare offers a more sustainable way to get around. Even better, of the 600 Modo cars available, one in five is electric or hybrid.
And by teaching your teen in a carshare vehicle, you’re instilling these behaviours in a future generation, which benefits both the membership and society at large.
After all, every Modo takes approximately nine to 13 private vehicles off the road.
It’s inclusive
Modo has been driving change for more than 20 years—pun intended. Although driving might not be the rite of passage that it once was, it is still a useful skill for young people to have. Beyond giving them independence, it also teaches them valuable lessons on responsibility, and it may even help with employability.
So consider Modo as offering all the benefits of having a car without the costs or hassle.
This is definitely the time to let your teen take you for a ride. And these days, with more multigeneration families as well as kids staying home for what might feel like forever, your 30-year-old with an L can join too!

Experts believe that enterprise-wide data interchange can be streamlined with a dedicated EDI integration software combined with a focused approach. Here are some best practices for supercharging your EDI program.

The autonomous car has thrown the automotive industry — an industry that is notoriously slow to change — into the forefront of technology. The autonomous car has become a technology catalyst because it requires innovation in many areas, ranging from processor and sensor technology to artificial intelligence.

As with all new technologies, the industry rushes to focus on consumers because they represent the billion-dollar pot of gold, but as with many other new technologies, it is the industrial applications that are likely to take hold first.
The auto industry has focused on the concept of the autonomous car, but when you broaden the category to include all forms of transportation and autonomous control, the opportunity is much larger than just automating the average car.
In fact, most forecasts for car and light vehicle demand predict sales growth of only a few percentage points as the industry struggles to reach the 100-million-unit-per-year mark over the next few years. That’s not to say that nearly a 100 million units annually and the transition to autonomous cars don’t offer a big opportunity, because they do.
Opportunities Abound
The more automated a vehicle becomes, the more electronics it requires, which raises the total available market, or TAM, for automotive electronics. However, it is likely to take several decades before the majority of cars sold are autonomous, and that will require significant cost reductions for the electronics.
The immediate opportunities lie in mass transit, on-demand transportation, as well as trucking, shipping, and other forms of industrial transportation.
Even though the developments in these areas are not as highly publicized, there are many companies driving innovation. Autonomous shipping technology has become a focus for a range if companies — from the underlying technology companies like NXP, to industrial manufacturers like Rolls Royce, and the shipping companies themselves.
Autonomous trucking has been attracting automotive heavyweights like Daimler and Volvo, along with startups like Tesla and Embark.
Even the ride-sharing company Uber is considering autonomous delivery vehicles.
As with other new emerging technologies, like augmented reality, autonomous technology makes sense for industrial applications. There can be an immediate return on investment for the adopter, even while the technology is establishing a foothold in an evolving market.
As with any new tech, it will take two to three generations for the ecosystem to mature. The ecosystem includes the technology, platforms, applications, usage models, and even business models that must evolve.
Industrial applications offer a new technology to customers that are willing to work through the development process and are willing to pay a premium for the technology because they can expect a return in cost savings or productivity gains.
In the case of industrial transportation, the higher equipment cost should be offset by gains in equipment efficiency and utilization rates, as well as lower accident and insurance rates, among other benefits.
Value Chain Disruption
Autonomous transportation systems also eliminate the most common factor in accidents — human error. That’s not to say that autonomous solutions will be perfect. Any intelligence platform, whether human or artificial, will have to learn new circumstances — but the potential for failure is far lower with artificial intelligence.
I stress this because even though a few people have been killed in recent months due to autonomous cars, the National Safety Council estimates that vehicular deaths in the U.S. have exceeded 40,000 annually over the past two years.

Additionally, the business models for the automotive industry likely will change drastically as the industry moves toward autonomous vehicles. In fact, the industry already has been changing, with ride-sharing and car-sharing services like Uber and ZipCar, and the direct-to-consumer sales model of Tesla.
In addition, the vehicles have been getting more technically complicated through advanced driver-assistance systems, or ADAS, and electrification — so much so that many traditional auto mechanics will not be able to work on hybrid, electric and autonomous vehicles.
These changes likely will alter the entire value chain of the automotive industry. Toyota, for example, has been testing a car-sharing service called “Hai” in Hawaii. If you have an automotive OEM offering electric vehicles directly to consumers in a car-sharing model, you may eliminate the need for third-party dealers, gas stations and local mechanic shops, while the OEM’s primary revenue shifts to services, not the sales of vehicles.
Autonomous technology also is likely to lead to other advances in transportation. We have dreamed about flying cars since the 1950s, but just to fly a small plane requires specialized knowledge and training. Adding autonomous control eliminates a key requirement for flying applications.
In addition, autonomous flight already is well on the way to being perfected through drone technology. As a result, we finally may be on the cusp of a flying car era — but the cars likely will be more similar to unmanned drones than to passenger vehicles.
AeroMobil, Airbus, Auston Martin, EHang, eVolo, Kittyhawk, Rolls-Royce, Terrafugia, and Uber are just a few of the companies reportedly working on flying vehicles of one sort or another.
While the thought of owning an autonomous car remains intriguing, the real opportunity for the next decade lies in the industrial applications. Looking beyond the next decade, the way society views and leverages transportation likely will change over the next century to a point where the personal car may no longer be the image of freedom, success or independence that it is today. It may simply be a form of transportation.

SoftBank Group Corp Chief Executive Masayoshi Son blasted Japan on Thursday (July 19) for not allowing ride-sharing services, calling it “stupid” and saying the country was lagging overseas rivals in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI).
“Ride-sharing is prohibited by law in Japan. I can’t believe there is still such a stupid country,” Mr Son said at an annual company event aimed at customers and suppliers.
The comments reflect Mr Son’s frustration with Japan, where he built SoftBank’s domestic telecoms business, the cash engine that has powered his investments.

The group has, however, focused its growing range of technology investments overseas.
Mr Son has also been highly critical of the government previously when SoftBank was still a fledgling telecoms service trying to break up a cosy duopoly in Japan.
“A country that gives up on the future has no future,” Mr Son told attendees at the SoftBank World event, saying Japanese business is lagging behind countries such as the United States and China in employing AI.
Japan outlaws non-professional drivers from transporting paying customers on safety grounds and the country’s taxi industry lobby has vigorously opposed deregulation.
Its strict rules have confined ride-sharing firms to providing limited services, with SoftBank and China’s Didi Chuxing saying on Thursday they will trial a taxi-hailing service – matching users to pre-existing taxi operators – in Osaka beginning autumn of 2019. Uber is also piloting a taxi-hailing service.
When asked for a response to Mr Son’s comments, a spokesman for the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport said that an issue with ride-sharing services was that while the driver was in charge of transporting passengers, it was unclear who was in charge of maintenance and operation.
“The ministry believes that offering these services for a fee poses problems from the points of both safety and user protection, and careful consideration is necessary,” he said.
HOME-SHARING CURBS
Ride-sharing is not the only service in Japan feeling the impact of government restrictions. Strict new rules on home-sharing came into force last month that have radically reduced the number of lettings on sites such as Airbnb Inc.
The curbs on Japan’s nascent sharing economy come despite a rapid rise in the number of inbound tourists likely to access such sharing services, and at a time when Japan is wanting to show its international face ahead of hosting the Rugby World Cup next year and the Summer Olympics in 2020.

While Mr Son, an ethnic Korean born in Japan, has at times criticised the Japanese government, he can also be politically suave.
He has praised US President Donald Trump with warm words and pledged to invest billions of dollars and create thousands of jobs in the United States.
SoftBank and its nearly US$100 billion (S$137.18 billion) Vision Fund have invested in ride-sharing firms Uber Technologies Inc, Didi, India’s Ola and South-east Asia’s Grab, as well as in other technology companies.
The event on Thursday saw presentations from executives at portfolio companies including Didi, General Motors’ autonomous vehicle unit Cruise and India digital payments firm Paytm E-Commerce Pvt Ltd.
Artificial intelligence is the common thread linking these companies, Mr Son said, with that technology in the future able drive vehicles, diagnose diseases and power financial services.

HYUNDAI owners will soon be able to earn thousands for simply not using their car.

The South Korean car maker has joined forces with local car sharing company Car Next Door which allows properly vetted users to rent nearby vehicles either by the hour or the day.
Hyundai is currently developing its next-generation infotainment technology that will integrate the Car Next Door peer-to-peer car sharing app into its vehicles so owners can easily rent their cars out when they are not in use.
The car sharing company suggests that the average mid-size vehicle can earn upwards of $3000 a year while van owners can expect more than double that figure.
The in-built functionality will do away with a traditional key, allowing renters to access and drive Hyundais enrolled in the scheme with only a smartphone.

Hyundai will roll out the next-generation technology in 2019, with Hyundai Australia chief operating officer Scott Grant hoping that it will allow customers to earn some extra cash.
“By the end of 2019, Australians will be able to buy a Hyundai car with the built-in ability to seamlessly and easily rent it out and earn extra money,” Grant says.
“This capability will be pre-installed and integrated into a new version of Hyundai’s Auto Link unit, making it a simple matter to earn extra funds via Car Next Door’s innovative car sharing platform.”
Car Next Door founder Will Davies added that the program allows users to have a car whenever they need one while owners can cover the growing costs of ownership.

“Fuel prices, economic pressures and rapid changes in vehicle technology are all supporting the development of connected cars and the sharing economy”, stated Davis. “So you can have a car when you need one, but when you’re not using it, the vehicle is out there making you money.”


The move by Hyundai is part of a growing trend among car manufacturers that are looking to expand beyond the traditional new car sales methods.


Last year Holden launched its Maven service that allows Uber drivers to rent vehicles directly from the brand rather than purchasing them outright. The rental price — that starts from $215 a week — includes insurance and maintenance and has no kilometre limit or extra fees.

However, in the US Maven rents out GM owned vehicles to regular road users not just Uber drivers. And much like the upcoming Hyundai-Car Next Door partnership the linked cars are accessible to registered users by smartphone.
But now, according to a Bloomberg report earlier this year, Maven is trialling peer-to-peer car sharing that allows individual owners to rent out their vehicles to other users.
Overseas, several car companies have aligned with ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft to help develop driverless cars and to plan for the next phase of new cars sales once autonomous vehicles become more commonplace and private car ownership recedes.

New York: in a city where parking spots can be as hard to come by as “Hamilton” tickets, residents are at odds over a new arrangement that’s taking away hundreds of public spaces and doling them out to companies that rent out cars by the hour.

In the past few weeks, New York City began repurposing 230 curbside spaces for the exclusive use of Enterprise CarShare and Zipcar. Street signs warn interlopers against parking in them; violators are ticketed and towed.
An additional 55 spots in city-owned parking lots and 24 at public housing complexes also are being set aside for the companies.
The two-year pilot program is pitting proponents of car sharing, who see it as an efficient alternative to car ownership, against car owners, who fear fewer spaces will force them to circle the block even more.


“Parking is not an easy thing to find. Period,” said Jerry Armer, whose Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, neighborhood has seen 18 on-street spaces reserved for car sharing.


In his neighborhood, at certain times of the day, it isn’t unusual to have to circle for 30 minutes for an open spot, only to wind up a half-mile from home.
New Yorkers also deal with alternate-side parking, which involves having to move your car once or twice a week to make way for street cleaners.
The pilot program has elicited some grumbles over the price these for-profit companies are paying for exclusive use of these hard-to-get spots: almost nothing.
Zipcar and Enterprise are each paying a one-time $765 fee for the curbside spots and $1,000 to $1,200 per year for each space in the city-owned lots.
Residents of city-owned public housing also will receive discounts on car sharing services.

In an age of collaborative consumption, the booming sharing economy is spurring car rental giant Avis Budget Group to navigate creative ways to grow the size and share of the travel pie through the inking of partnerships with multiple peer-to-peer car sharing players.
The latest to sign a multi-year deal with Avis is ride-hailing company Lyft. Under this partnership, Avis will contribute thousands of vehicles from its fleet of 600,000 to the Lyft Express Drive programme in cities across North America.
In Asia-Pacific, Avis has launched various strategic initiatives with popular local ride-sharing players, including China’s Didi Chuxing and Singapore’s Grab. Avis Philippines – together with Avis Global and Metro Davao Taxi Association – also developed Hirna, a taxi-hailing app that aims to improve taxi services in key cities outside Manila.
Angeline Tang, Avis’ regional director – leisure travel & partnerships, Asia, told TTG Asia: “Ride-hailing companies are our allies, not competitors. The more opportunities consumers have for mobility that do not involve owning their own car, the more we benefit.
“As this decline in ownership continues, the future holds a greater need for more, and more flexible mobility options, which explains why the pie is getting bigger, not shrinking or just being divided up differently.”

On average, Avis reports mileage of some 724km over four rental days, or 177km per rental day. In comparison, on shorter-length rentals – lasting over one to two days – the mileage per day increases, described Tang.
Such cases, for which ride-hailing are not economical, are where car rentals come in, she said.
Avis also works with Luxury Retreats, acquired by Airbnb in February 2017, as the official mobility partner of the full-service premium villa rental company.
Further, in 2013, Avis acquired car-sharing network Zipcar, which has more than one million members across the world. This movement is poised to give Avis “a foothold in the rapidly growing world of collaborative consumption”, explained Tang.
She added: “By working with ride-hailing players, we can address the growing demand for transportation in key markets, and further leverage our assets.”

The administrators in charge of the mobility infrastructures of London, Madrid and Barcelona, Amsterdam, Antwerp as well as Gent and even Singapore have expressed keen interest in the “Share your BICAR” concept. They all have identified a significant added value in this option, which is ideal for year-round use regardless of the season and allows drivers to forego the helmet, unlike existing sharing models, such as scooter and bicycles. 
Good reasons for the City of Winterthur, the Regional Association of Baden Wettingen (RVBW) and the pick-e-bike sharing service of the Baselland Transport AG to sign cooperative agreements aiming at the deployment of the  BICAR vehicle as a pilot project in less than a year.

Right now, the development team is feverishly working on version BICAR 3.0 –  the vehicle that meets all registration criteria for operation on public roadways and that is slated for use during the pilot phase.
 In conjunction with these undertakings, the enterprise can count on the support of the Alternative Bank Schweiz as an additional investor and has entered into cooperative partnerships with other Swiss companies (Kyburz, PostAuto, Bosch Car Service, etc.).
The European Parliament and many European cities have decided to cut urban metropolitan fossil fuel driven automotive transportation by up to 100%. Goals such as these fuel the vision of Share your BICAR AG with even more passion: “Every BICAR vehicle used as part of the sharing model reduces  CO2 emissions by at least a ton a year and results in the expendability of eight cars,” says Burri. 
“In a joint effort with strong partners and investors who are eager to shape the future of metropolises with us, we will attain the goal of sustainable, CO2-emissions-free mobility.” Anyone interested in supporting the project is encouraged to reach out to the founders.
 
 
Share your BICAR AG develops and distributes an innovative, electric drive based mobility solution that has been optimized for short distance driving in urban, downtown areas. The solution consists of the BICAR vehicle, a battery exchange station and mobility software. BICAR is the world´s smallest and most lightweight vehicle, which is also patent-protected that allows an individual to quickly and safely zip through town while being protected from the elements.  Share your BICAR AG in a spin-off of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences. The enterprise was established by Adrian Burri and Hans Jorg Denning.

THE WAY we use our cars and the number of vehicles the average Aussie household needs are on the brink of dramatic change with the proliferation of alternative mobility options in our major cities.

The world’s largest car sharing company, Car2Go, is sizing us up, with a view to launching on the east coast of Australia as soon as next year. The Daimler-owned enterprise would introduce hundreds of Mercedes-Benz vehicles to our roads for the use of members, potentially removing the need for thousands of privately owned cars.
Australia is yet to see the arrival of a free-floating car-sharing venture, which allows vehicles to be picked up and dropped off anywhere, without the limitation of assigned parking spots located in potentially inconvenient places. The format is something Car2Go pioneered almost a decade ago, and now provides to 3.2 million users in 28 cities globally.
Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane hold the most potential here according to Car2Go Europe CEO Thomas Beermann, whose team first explored the possibility of an Australian launch back in 2013. This time around there’s greater engagement from state governments. The next hurdle is coordinating local municipalities.

“The area we operate in covers between 50 and 150 square kilometres depending on the city. Melbourne and Sydney are very decentralised. Sydney is made up of 45 councils, Melbourne has 20-something, and we need a parking regulation which covers all of them.
“For us, you can start your rental at Point A and stop at Point B and they can be two totally different councils. That’s what is unique of this service.”
With an agreement in place the likelihood of launch is “very, very high”, and possible within six to nine months of that happening, says Beermann.

So how would it work?
“If we look at Sydney, we would end up with a business area a little below 150km². We would put between six and eight vehicles per square kilometre to have sufficient availability. This means about 1000 vehicles. Melbourne, more like 70 to 80km², and more like 500-600 vehicles.”
A mix of A-, CLA- and GLA-Class vehicles would make up the fleet. Renting one in existing overseas markets costs more than mass public transport, but less than a taxi or Uber. According to Beermann, Australian cities have the same key characteristics as continental European ones to make the service work.
In cities of a similar size to Sydney, shared cars average eight rentals a day and a total moving time of four to five hours. That’s five times the private car average. This has a significant impact on the availability of parking spaces, especially during the day.
In Berlin car ownership among adults has declined to 35 percent. In Australia it is above 60 percent.
“We don’t see ourselves as the solution, we see ourselves as part of the solution. Car ownership will always play a major role in Australia because of the distances you have to cover. But I think for urban travel, usage of the private car will reduce.”

If you’re a screenwriter—or a car salesman—you’re already thinking of ways to write non-sci-fi self-driving cars into a movie script. Automobiles have been integral to the plots of gritty noir crime movies, heist flicks, romantic comedies, and obviously, road movies.
What’s clear is the self-driving car won’t be the ideal getaway vehicle anymore, particularly if there is no steering wheel or gas pedal. And while it’s not hard to imagine a world in which technology controls people, the alternative script involves self-driving cars that are pushed around by human drivers, pedestrians, scooters, or even bicyclists.
“You can bully self-driving cars,” said Peter Hancock, Provost’s Distinguished Research Professor and head of the MIT² Laboratory at the University of Central Florida (UCF), where he studies autonomous vehicles and psychology. “Once you know the way it is going to react, you can move it over in its lane or make it decelerate, because you can be the bigger bully and you know that it is going to avoid hitting you. If you start edging into the lane it is going to start edging away from you.”
Who should fear whom? For now, people seem to be afraid of the self-driving car, and the numbers don’t seem to be improving. AAA reported in May 2018 that Americans are more afraid to ride in a fully autonomous vehicle than they were the prior year. In fact, AAA said 73% of driving Americans are afraid to ride in a fully self-driving vehicle.

“There may be some people who never trust an automated system,” said Hancock, who studies dimensions of trust of systems and humans in his lab. “When Tesla and Waymo are marketing, they have to market to people who are going to trust those systems.”
But if anyone needs to be afraid, it might be weighted heavily against self-driving car OEMs and their programmers.
“This will be a big problem, and so far we have not seen plans for a solution,” said Ty Garibay, chief technology advisor at ArterisIP. “The big problem is robots or autonomous things interacting with people. And while this may not be a problem in a factory, because people are paid to work with robots, it’s definitely an issue with autonomous vehicles in cities. I don’t see how autonomous vehicles will work in an urban area. You see the same thing happening in the home market with robots if a child knows it won’t do anything.”
The reason is simple—human beings are unpredictable, aggressive, and sometimes malicious creatures.
Mixed driving styles
This presents a problem because self-driving cars and human drivers will share the road for many years. “It’s going to be very interesting as we look to the future with that mixed fleet because the autonomous cars are driven and behave differently than their human counterparts, and that’s often a good thing,” Greg Brannon, director of automotive engineering at the American Automobile Association, told Semiconductor Engineering. “Self-driving cars are more cautious. They are more likely to obey speed limits. They are less likely to be distracted. All those things are good. But they will stand out among human-driven counterparts for some time, until the programming develops in the sensor fusion and all of the artificial intelligence to the point that they mimic a safe human driver.”
Different driving styles add to the complexity self-driving car programmers have to contend with. Cities and states vary in what is expected and how drivers interact. Human drivers and pedestrians have to learn these styles when visiting from a different place. It’s the same for a self-driving car?
“I just returned from in Italy,” said Hancock. “I did bit of driving myself. How does a self-driving car ever work in Italy, because you are constantly being cut off by Vespas?” He concluded it’s faster to walk.
There’s an unwritten code between humans that use the transportation system, he said, using Italy as an example. At first, such local systems don’t make sense to the stranger. But then the driver learns local ways drivers communicate with each other. Drivers in Italy don’t allow slow drivers to sit in the fast lane. A human gradually learns to appreciate why the local customs exist, but the self-driving car needs that to be programmed into its logic.
“If you traveled overseas or traveled enough around the U.S., you can begin to realize that different geographies have different driving styles and likely for the automation to function well, the automation might have to be geographically oriented,” Brannon agreed. ”In fact It’s a very complex task but as we look towards the future, that’s something to be considered.”
“Imagine a car—an autonomous vehicle—that waits for the proper break in traffic before it enters the Holland Tunnel. That autonomous car likely will be there for the next decade before it gets into the tunnel.” laughed Brannon. “There’s all those things that will have to be worked out. So it will be a mix and there’s a lot of very, very smart people that are working in this space but it is a big challenges.”
Cars will have to adapt, or they will have to be regulated.
“There are two scenarios unfolding here,” said Burkhard Huhnke, vice president of automotive strategy at Synopsys. “One is happening in China, where you can have a fully autonomous city and avoid hybrid mixes of human drivers and autonomous vehicles. The other is when you have a hybrid world of human-driven and autonomous vehicles, which is where we are today. The average time a car stays in the market is eight years, and within the next eight years you’re going to see more and more autonomous technology coming into the market. The big question is how that will affect your daily commute.”
It’s not just people that will cause the problems, though. How autonomous vehicles interact with other autonomous vehicles has yet to be ironed out, too.
“If your maximum speed is 10% lower than you competitor’s car, that can cause a problem,” Huhnke said. “Even with acceleration, does it go full-throttle or smoothly? Programming everything to work together is quite a challenge. Humans see a speed limit sign and sometimes we think we can go faster. So it’s a question of interpretation of rules. With self-driving cars, you have to build in flexibility to be able to deal with that.”
Bullying the robocar
Autonomous vehicles are expected to be predictable, polite and patient drivers. And humans will quickly learn how to push these types of suckers around. Will pedestrians start jaywalking more and jumping in front of self-driving cars that stop no matter what?
“Gosh, I sure hope not,” said AAA’s Brannon. “There’s something called physics that is involved, as well. Regardless of the technology, that’s very difficult to overcome.”
That may boil down to how human-like the technology can become. “The key right now is that people can tell it’s an autonomous car,” said Jack Weast, chief systems architect of autonomous driving solutions at Intel. “They drive conservatively, which makes it a target. There’s a technical reason for that, which is decision-making algorithms are implemented using reinforcement learning. It’s basically reward behavior, which could be time to destination or fuel economy. The problem with AI systems is that they’re probabilistic, so you’re dealing with a best guess. There are multiple sensors to recognize cars and pedestrians, so if one sensor misses another picks it up. But there is no redundancy in the decision-making. And because a wrong decision may cause an accident, the weight for safety has a higher reward. That’s why autonomous vehicles are overly conservative. You see them jerking back into their lane. You also see human drivers getting annoyed by them.”
Intel’s approach to solving this problem is to create an AI stack, rather than an end-to-end system, establishing a hierarchy of AI functions. At the top is what it calls Responsibility Sensitive Safety, which the company has published as open source.

“This allows a car to be more assertive and human-like,” said Weast. “If I’m sitting in the back seat of an autonomous car I can’t tell if it’s being driven by a person or whether it’s autonomous. This is where we’re heading. It’s a mixed environment future. Even in New York City, a human driver will not hit the brake pedal until the last possible second. Autonomous vehicles can do this, too. They can wedge into traffic to create space, look for a vehicle to give way, and back up into their lane if they don’t. The origins of this approach go back to safety, and the safety value of RSF is that it can be formally verified. This is a lot different than the current industry approach of, ‘Here’s a black box, trust me.’ It doesn’t matter if you’ve driven 1 million miles. End-to-end AI approaches are dangerous. You need layering or stacking or stages, so if one algorithm changes the independent safety seal remains static.”
Another issue is the safest traveling distance, said UCF’s Hancock. A safe traveling distance can be really far behind the car it is following—or just one foot away. “The reason one foot proves to be safe is because the car in front can only change velocity a very little amount, so there is not enough space to cause a collision.” If a one-foot driving distance is also one of the optimal following distances that the automated vehicle can choose, it can cause panic unless the human driver knows this is a safe self-driving car behind him.
Siemens has developed a verification and simulator system that helps discover edge cases with virtualization engine and simulator. These edge cases can be used for training self-driving cars. When Google drives millions of road tests, “what they’re looking for is the edge cases where some complex traffic scenario appears pedestrians and whatever else,” said Andrew Macleod, director of automotive marketing at Mentor, a Siemens Business. “That can all be done in the virtual world, so Siemens has got a virtualization capability where we can create vehicle scenarios against pedestrians coming in front of a vehicle at a specific speed, and so on. We can simulate all of the different data from sensors, whether it’s a camera, radar, LiDAR. And then we can add weather, for example. How does the camera sensor respond if it is snowing? We model all of that and create these edge cases, and then feed that data into a vehicle simulator to see how the vehicle responds. For example, you might have some scenario where the vehicle has to swerve to avoid the obstacle, pedestrian or whatever else. We can actually model how the vehicle behaves in an extreme example.”
What isn’t obvious is how people will react. “Automotive OEMs are dealing with this today from the driver and pedestrian side,” said Tim Lau, senior director of automotive product marketing at Marvell. Current collision avoidance systems may stop the human driver from trying the bullying. “They really want to have systems that predict what the driver intends to do. To be able to predict that, there’s a lot of information that the car needs to understand, including the driver’s state. There are so many technologies out that, like ADAS for collision avoidance.”
But the pedestrian who bullies? “Once I asked the car OEMs how they protect for that,” said Lau. “What is the plan? The systems are designed to protect and gather data and make best decisions, but if someone wants to be malicious and step in front of the car, I don’t think there is a system in place today that can deal with that.”
Creating systems that communicate with pedestrians can help. These so-called V2x systems have many uses, and there are a variety of technologies under development around the world. “This will be different technologies, like the smart garage has sensors that tell you what spot is taken or not,” said Lau. “Having that ability to have car-to-car, car-to-person, car-to-infrastructure communication is vital. It can tie into your cell phone or watch. Even the visibility around a corner will be possible.”
The real turning point, though, will be the smart city. “What the smart city offers you that sensors like LiDAR and camera and radar don’t is vehicle-to-vehicle communication and vehicle-to-infrastructure,” said Mentor’s Macleod. “The question of autonomous vehicles bullying each other and nudging each other on the road wouldn’t happen once we can communicate with each other because the most efficient path to get from A to B will be defined, with a driving scenario mapped out in terms of when to accelerate and when to brake. Eventually, traffic lanes probably wouldn’t be needed. The cars will just communicate with each other.”
Reaching for Level 5
Despite Volvo’s recently announced concept for autonomous commuter pods, where passengers can sit at a table or sleep in a bed as a vehicle traverses hundreds of miles of roadway, the short-term future appears to be much more modest. Most likely the first self-driving cars will be used for ride sharing in limited areas of a city. Along with that, fleets of trucks that cruise the freeways at night are likely to deliver goods to a simple end point.

“We don’t think it’s going to be anything like there’ll be more self-driving cars and all of a sudden the streets will be flooded with them everywhere,” said Macleod. “But you can put a bunch of self-driving trucks on the road at night going from point A to Point B very predictable. After that, campuses and maybe airports, followed by something like a downtown area maybe three to five square miles, which would be fully autonomous with autonomous robotaxis.”
This matches Ford’s current prediction—urban mobility and delivery services—as possible first uses for the automated system. The company is working on this plan with startup Argo AI. Ford has set a goal of having self-driving cars on the road by 2021, but Bryan Salesky, Argo’s CEO said the technology won’t be released until it is ready
“Every day that we test we learn of and uncover new scenarios that we want to make sure the system can handle,” said Salesky. Ford is testing the cars in Miami-Dade County in Florida. Even then, the car will drive in certain cities in certain closed geo-fenced locations and will function as a ride sharing service. The other option is automated trucking at night.
Ford uses two humans inside the test car monitoring what is happening in the road tests and ready to take over the driving if needed. The humans report back to Argo if odd interactions happen around the vehicle concerning pedestrians or other vehicles. “In the cities we operate in, we haven’t seen any reactions that are different than what you would normally see,” said Salesky. “They very much treat us like any other vehicle. We have actually gotten a positive response from the community in that our vehicles are cautious. They don’t get distracted. They are able to stop with plenty of margin before a crosswalk to let people use the crosswalk. Our car won’t pull into a crosswalk and block it. Our vehicle will nudge over and give pedestrians who are jogging along the side of the road a little more room.”
Ford is also experimenting with communicating with pedestrians using lights. This still has a long way to go. “What we do is over time is build up this database of regression tests that need to pass before a new line of code can be added to the system. That scenario set is a really critical piece of our development process,” said Salesky, who got his start working on DARPA vehicles as part of Carnegie Mellon University National Robotics Engineering Center and on Google’s self-driving car.
Argo and Ford don’t push out code to the cars before it is tested thoroughly and shown to be error-free, even if the change could be a simple change that fixes one problem. Argo owns its own AI database and coding.
Will self-driving cars save lives?
The semiconductor and automotive industries contend that self-driving vehicles will save lives. Some academics agree that the conservative, law-abiding self-driving car will do just that. But there’s a catch.
There are about 35,000 to 40,000 vehicle-related fatalities a year in the United States, depending on who’s counting. The National Safety Council is spearheading an effort to get the number down to zero by 2050 with the Road to Zero coalition. But drill down into those numbers and motorcycles were involved in 14% of the deaths in 2014, says NSC. Moreover, almost half of roadway deaths occur on rural roads, which are the most dangerous roads to drive on.
So will self-driving cars make a dent in those numbers any time soon? Where speed and impairment (drunk, drugged, drowsy, or texting) are factors in the deaths, where the self-driving car may have a big role to play. The coalition concluded that autonomous driving assistance systems will help, it noted they are only part of the solution. They also want to engender a culture of zero tolerance for unsafe behavior, along with better roadways and infrastructure. (Their report is here).
“We continue to see deaths on the American roadway, some 35,000 annually, and somewhere between 80% and 90% of those deaths are the result of human error,” said AAA’s Brannon. “The idea is that if you can remove that human error, the number will decrease. That’s not to say that the autonomous vehicles won’t make mistakes along the way.”
But saving lives as a selling point doesn’t necessarily add up yet, according to Professor Hancock. “The problem is that these systems cannot be free of flaw. It is just not physically possible. The flaw might be in the design, it might be in the software, it might be in the software integration. This is not going to be a collision-free system for many decades to come. In fact, autonomous systems will create their own new sorts of accidents. We are going to see these types of collisions coming up not despite automation, but because of some of the assumptions that they make.”
The hack is coming from inside the car
Not all the troublesome human behavior comes from outside the car, though. Drivers/passengers of any vehicle at any autonomous level may learn to hack the car to tone down or shut off features. For example, in June 2018, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a cease-and-desist letter to the third-party vendor selling the after-market Autopilot Buddy, a device that reduces the Tesla’s nagging when hands are removed from the steering wheel.
AAA’s Brannon is concerned that human drivers may put too much trust in the semi-autonomous systems in their cars. “There’s a tradeoff,” he said. “It is going back to the human behind wheel, making sure that this human understands the benefits as well as the limitations of whatever technology the vehicle has that they are operating, whether that’s a 1990 Ford F150 or the latest Tesla. Everyone should understand the systems and not the vehicles that they are driving.”
Whether or not it becomes illegal some day for humans to drive a car, as Elon Musk mused at a 2015 Nvidia conference, one thing is for certain: The self-driving car will profoundly change our car culture forever.

China has quickly become the world’s largest mobility market, as consumers embrace new digital practices arising from the convergence of innovations in automotive, technology and e-commerce. The robust growth will likely continue, fueled by US$50 billion in investments from 2014 to 2017.
This huge shift will have major implications across industries. Automakers, for example, will need to rethink their business models as China’s snarled roads and the convenience of new mobility services upend traditional notions of car ownership. 
Also, there will be openings for new players to enter the market and for novel partnerships with incumbents.
To understand and track these coming changes, Bain & Company is surveying thousands of consumers in the United States, Germany and China every three years. In our 2014 study, the mobility industry in Germany and the US outpaced China’s. Just three years later, China dwarfs those markets.
Take e-hailing: From $5 billion in 2014, China’s market for ordering car rides electronically is now $30 billion, and was already bigger than the rest of the world combined when we looked at 2016 figures, the last time comparable data was available. We estimate it will reach $72 billion by 2020. The bicycle sharing market, virtually nonexistent in 2014, now totals 120 million monthly active bikes.
Our survey of almost 2,000 consumers in major Chinese cities found a 60 percent increase in travel in the past two years. New services accounted for a significant part of that increase.
Bike sharing, the most popular solution, was used by 73 percent of respondents; e-hailing was second — used by 62 percent. Those numbers were 29 percent and 9 percent, respectively, in Germany and 23 percent and 8 percent in the US. Moreover, Chinese consumers are less likely than their counterparts to use such traditional solutions as car rentals.
With technology integration, government support and the emergence of new options such as B2C car sharing, China’s mobility industry will likely continue on its upward trajectory.
Given these newly available transportation options, the formidable traffic congestion in big cities and the costs of car ownership, more Chinese consumers are turning their backs on buying automobiles.
In 2014, almost 60 percent of our survey participants felt that owning a car improves one’s social status. In our latest study, less than 50 percent did.
Both car owners and potential car owners agree on the specific factors that will persuade them to give up their vehicles. Heavy traffic tops the list. In almost equal measure — 24 percent vs 25 percent — car owners and potential owners say they would not buy a car if China’s traffic congestion tripled in the coming years. Greater convenience in mobility services and better multimodal connectivity in public transit were other key factors cited that would further erode the lure of car ownership.
As China’s mobility ecosystem expands, its shape is likely to change. For example, Didi captures 90 percent of all e-hailing trips and 40 percent of the volume among e-hailing traffic portals. A number of factors could alter that situation, from the emergence of local and regional players, to a consolidation among traffic portals, to a rise in the use of WeChat and other social and lifestyle commerce platforms.
Already, as many as 50 percent of all e-hailed rides are ordered from platforms such as WeChat, Dianping and Alipay. This offers competing e-hailing players the chance to catch up if they form the right partnerships with these or other portals.
Autonomous vehicles represent another major change. Among our survey participants, 26 percent expect autonomous vehicles to be a significant urban mobility solution within three years. E-hailing companies and others in China’s mobility industry are likely to amass fleets of autonomous vehicles.
As the industry achieves scale, profit pools could potentially shift away from OEMs to downstream services, with mobility platforms and customer interfaces reaping margins of more than 20 percent and value-added service providers achieving more than 15 percent margins.
Slower car sales growth means automakers will need new revenue streams. By partnering with the likes of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, for example, OEMs could access vastly more consumer data and gain a deeper understanding of their profiles — what they like, where they dine out and so on.
It would position them to provide location-based advertising or other innovative services or products, expanding their role in the mobility ecosystem.
OEMs are already moving in this direction. Many have launched or piloted mobility businesses — Daimler has Car2Go, BMW has ReachNow, SAIC has EVCard and Ford has Chariot. Some OEMs have formed partnerships with mobility platforms such as Didi to offer customized vehicles for their fleets.
OEMs will need to get ahead of other big changes. Our study found that e-hailing consumers care most about cost, waiting time and driver ratings — and much less about the brand of car.
This has huge implications for automakers that have worked hard to build differentiated brands. Another significant consideration: With mobility platforms such as Didi and emerging corporate car sharing companies set to be a growing segment of the vehicle market, OEMs may need to customize cars for these new and important customers.
For their part, e-hailing and car sharing services will need to adapt to the evolving mobility ecosystem. For example, the arrival of autonomous vehicles will likely transform e-hailing businesses that depend on individual drivers. Like OEMs, these services could build upon the growth of consumer data to deliver location-based advertising.
Or, there may be a market for platforms that help commuters plan the most efficient travel using all modes of transportation.
For all players, getting ahead of these shifts requires not only understanding how an existing business model is affected and how to mitigate the risks, but also evaluating potential opportunities and creating the right alliances for a new and dynamic industry. In the world’s largest mobility market, no company will win alone.

The carpooling world was rocked last month when the largest player Poolus fired 70 percent of its staff and its CEO Kim Tae-ho stepped down, leaving smaller competitors uncertain about the industry’s future.
In a country where peer-to-peer ride-hailing models like UberX are illegal, the homegrown app has represented a possible future for Korea’s burgeoning mobility-as-a-service industry since it was founded in 2016. Poolus avoids the Uber trap by exploiting a loophole in the local transport business law.
According to article 81 of the Passenger Transport Service Act, personal vehicles cannot be exploited for business purposes. But carpooling during commuting hours is an exception.
Poolus used this loophole to offer a carpooling service that was very specifically timed to fit within commuting hours. Things quickly went wrong when the start-up attempted to expand its service.
After Poolus announced it would let drivers decide which four hours in the morning and evening constituted their commuting hours, considering the increasingly common and flexible working hours, taxi operators argued that the start-up was attempting to operate a 24-hour ride-hailing service. The Seoul Metropolitan Government stepped in and asked the police to investigate the legality of the move.
Many industry insiders – especially those in the tech sector – consider Poolus’ downsizing to be a huge loss for Korea in an era of digitization and have criticized the outdated regulations and opposition from taxi drivers as standing in the way of progress.
However, the government and taxi drivers are still hesitant to embrace the peer-to-peer ride-hailing model that can disrupt the established transportation landscape in the country.

Korea’s unique public transportation system
A 58-year-old corporate taxi driver in Seoul surnamed Kim has been working in the industry for roughly 10 years. He is infuriated by how easily drivers using carpool apps can jump into the transportation business.
“We go through certain tests to earn a business license and I have to turn in 150,000 won ($134) from my daily earnings to my taxi company,” Kim said. “Our license ties us to a lot of business guidelines, but carpool drivers are unrestricted.”
According to Kim, corporate-hired taxi drivers work according to a 12-hour daily shift and private-owned taxi drivers – people operating business with their own car with a business plate purchased for roughly 100 million won – are required to rest once every three to four days in an attempt to control the oversupply of taxis. Carpool drivers are not limited by this restriction, allowing them to work whenever they want.
“Carpool drivers can also pick up multiple customers during a single trip, but taxi drivers are not allowed to do so,” Kim added.
Another problem caused by the lack of regulations controlling carpool drivers is that no one can guarantee the safety of passengers, according to a director from the Korea National Joint Conference of Taxi Association, a group representing over 100,000 corporate taxi drivers nationwide, who declined to be named.
“Frankly, we don’t know if the drivers have criminal records,” the director said.
According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, registered taxi drivers are checked every month in case their criminal record or any other conditions relevant to stripping them of their business license have changed.
The official from the taxi association also argued that it is unreasonable to say that the taxi industry is blocking Korea from technological advances, comparing the situation to other Southeast Asian countries that already have established ride-hailing services like Grab.
“There are reasons why Grab works in Southeast Asian countries,” the director said. “Taxis there weren’t very reliable in the first place, especially for tourists that are not acquainted with the local pricing system, which makes ride-hailing apps that give some information about drivers and pricing more reliable.”
According to a researcher at the state-run Korea Transport Institute, who also declined to be named, it does make it difficult for a country like Korea, where public transportation systems like buses, subways and taxis are already well established and tightly managed by the government, to make an ambitious change to existing transport regulations.
“It’s not only about taxi drivers’ interests,” the researcher said. “Deregulation [to allow ride-hailing apps] could disrupt the whole public transportation system in the country and so regulators have to be careful.”
Is coexistence impossible?
Start-ups like Uber and Poolus have never said that they want to kill the taxi industry, but all around the world, taxi drivers felt that their livelihood was threatened by how readily the service was picked up, especially by young people.

Despite safety concerns related to the ride-hailing app drivers – and there have been a number of assault and sexual assault cases reported in other countries, especially in the services’ early days – these apps continue to grow because they tend to offer rates that are at least 30 percent cheaper than taxis and are often more readily available.
A 30-year-old office worker surnamed Han who lives in Eunpyeong District in northern Seoul and works in Gwacheon in Gyeonggi often uses Poolus to go home when he drinks with his colleagues after work.
“Grabbing a cab is almost impossible around midnight, especially since I live in northern Seoul, which is not a very popular destination for taxi drivers compared to the posh Gangnam area,” Han said. “Carpooling apps are also more affordable.”
According to Han, office workers that try to hail a taxi on the streets after midnight when demand is high are acutely aware of the need for ride-hailing or carpooling apps.
So why can’t taxi drivers and carpool drivers work side-by-side?
Kakao Mobility, which operates the country’s dominant taxi-hailing app KakaoTaxi, actually attempted to do just that, acquiring Korea’s country’s second largest carpool app Luxi for 25.2 billion won in February with the intention of integrating it into the existing taxi-hailing service.
KakaoTaxi is the only on-demand transport app that is widely accepted and used by taxi drivers in Korea. As of the end of last year, 240,000 taxi drivers out of total 270,000 nationwide used the app with 18 million customers subscribed.
Kakao’s mobility business spin-off made sure to note that the carpool service will only be used to cover shortages at peak hours and that it will offer the service “within the legal boundaries” in a statement. Currently, carpool apps are only allowed to operate from 5 a.m. through 11 a.m. and from 5 p.m. through 2 a.m. – widely considered commuting hours.
Despite the explanation, Kakao was immediately attacked by taxi drivers for attempting to “compromise the benefits to taxi drivers by operating a carpool service.”
Both Kakao and Luxi are still working on how to come up with an acceptable business model that serves both customers and existing taxi drivers relying on KakaoTaxi for their livelihood, according to a Kakao Mobility spokesperson.
“I really think there are ways for taxis and carpool drivers to coexist,” says Lim Jung-wook, the managing director of Startup Alliance Korea, a private-public network dedicated to supporting Korean start-ups attempting to go global.
According to Lim, if traffic networking platforms can find ways for taxi drivers to work more efficiently and flexibly while tightening the screening process of its own drivers, a coexisting model could work.
“There are countries and cities amending regulations to reflect the changing market environment,” Lim said. “It’s an irreversible trend in the transport industry, just like we cannot go back to a time when we didn’t use smartphones.”
Lessons from overseas
Last month, Uber won an appeal in London to regain its taxi license for the next 15 months after agreeing to stricter government oversight.
In turn for the license, Uber’s new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, agreed to report incidents to the police directly rather than transport authorities, make six hours rest mandatory for drivers after 10 hours of operation and share traffic data with the city. It was a sign that Uber is beginning to take local regulations seriously in order to make its business sustainable.

A more inclusive model that could boost “coexistence” is UberFlash, currently being trialed in Singapore, according to researcher Kang Seo-jin from KB Financial Group.
The service was launched in January as a partnership between Uber and Singapore’s largest taxi operator ComfortDelGro. UberFlash pairs passengers with either an UberX car or a taxi depending on which is closest.
The model may well be one that KakaoTaxi is considering as the Korean app already has access to both taxi and carpool drivers, although whether the model is successful remains to be seen.
UberFlash operates on a 5 to 10 percent cheaper fare than UberX. Such a low fare has been a burden on taxi drivers, although they are able to connect with passengers faster by using the service.
There are also attempts to regulate ride-hailing app drivers.
Singapore’s Land Transport Authority introduced the Private Hire Car Driver’s Vocational License in July 2017, mandating drivers hoping to use their personal vehicle to transport paying customers to obtain the license by attending training programs and a criminal record screening. People with a record of sexual assault or murder cannot obtain the license at all.
In Malaysia, where Southeast Asia’s largest ride-hailing app Grab is legal, the country introduced a Taxi Industry Transformation Program in 2016 to level the playing field for taxi drivers.
Under the program, the country’s Land Public Transport Commission mandated vehicles providing ride-hailing services to comply with compulsory road worthiness inspections and relaxed taxi vehicle regulations so that taxi drivers could choose from a wider range of vehicles. It also said it will impose a stringent pre-screening process to improve the quality of taxi drivers and ride-hailing drivers.
“It is not easy to directly implement another city’s model in Korea, considering the different transportation infrastructure,” said Lim Seo-hyun, a researcher for the Korea Transport Institute, in a report November. “However, to verify the validity of various future mobility business models in Korea, the country needs to offer an opportunity for start-ups to at least test their services.”
Carpooling capital outflow
While discussions on deregulation are stuck in limbo and carpooling apps make little progress with their business, conglomerates like Samsung, Hyundai Motor and SK have been aggressively investing in foreign ride-hailing and peer-to-peer car sharing companies.
“Korea has reason to be concerned of deregulation, but it still needs to hurry up,” Lim from the Startup Alliance said. “Regulators need to understand that ride-hailing businesses are at the center of disruption in the transportation industry.”
All three conglomerates have invested in or joined partnerships with Southeast Asian ride-hailing company Grab. SK also has a stake in U.S. peer-to-peer car sharing company Turo. Most recently, on July 4, Hyundai Motor landed a partnership with Sydney-based car sharing start-up Car Next Door with the aim of launching a new app-based mobility service in Australia by 2020.
Lim says the investment is because they know platform providers will become major customers of driverless cars, which will be a much bigger market in the future. “But right now in Korea, these conglomerates have nobody to invest in,” Lim added.
Industry experts say that if the government does not foster mobility start-ups now, deregulation in the distant future will only benefit foreign operators.
In Asia, Uber has been losing to local apps like Didi Chuxing in China, Grab in Southeast Asia and Ola Cabs in India, according to Kang from KB Financial Group.

In the first installment of this series, I gave an introduction to telematics, explained the link between telematics and CSA, and showed how telematics could have an immediate impact on Unsafe Driving and Hours of Service – two Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (BASICs).
In part two, I recapped the state of telematics and introduced you to a few more of the benefits of telematics, including NBIS’s newly launched, one-of-a-kind telematics solution. In part three, I’ll be touching on how telematics can provide assistance in the event of an insurance claim.
Reporting
As you probably know, how fast you report an insurance claim matters. Getting the appropriate information to the insurance company as soon as possible gives the insurer the ability to start taking the actions needed to best manage a claim, which often leads to reduced costs and better outcomes.

Telematics gives insurers the ability to identify when an accident occurs – as soon as it occurs – allowing the claims team to start triaging the claim much earlier than ever before.
Using the vehicle behavior information that’s collected by telematics technology, including speed, hard breaking patterns and location, algorithms identify when an accident has occurred and stores critical data for further analysis.
If an actual crash has been detected, notification is quickly sent over to the claims team and the insurer receives a crash dossier detailing relevant crash and policy data, allowing the claim process to begin immediately.
Claims investigation
Commercial auto claims pose unique challenges due to the fact that first responders have to clean up an accident and get the road opened as quickly as possible. Often, critical data is lost before the insurance company has an opportunity to begin investigating. Telematics changes this.
Regardless of fault, the information collected can help determine causation factors related to the crash, which helps determine the direction an investigation will take and how best to protect the policyholder. When you have the ability to pair data, accident scene photos and driver feedback, the adjuster handling theclaim can make better fact-based decisions when deciding how to proceed. The information can also be used in accident-reconstruction efforts, injury assessments and repair estimates.
Fraud and theft
Telematics can also help detect fraud for injuries that appear to have been caused by your vehicle and driver. Having the ability to determine if your vehicle was even at the accident location at the time of an alleged incident can rule out liability early on. Having data that captures the impact and type of collision can help in determining whether or not the injury could have been caused by the accident in the first place.
Finally, telematics can be helpful in vehicle retrieval efforts. Telematics can assist in locating stolen vehicles in the critical early hours when the vehicle may still be in the geographical area.

This provides huge benefits as it gives both the insurers and policyholders the possibility of retrieving the stolen vehicle before major damage is caused or the vehicle is lost for good.
Remember, the benefits of telematics are substantial, but you only get them if you analyze and react to the data you’re collecting. Understand your data. Don’t leave it to the plaintiff counsel to show you just how valuable it is.
For more information on telematics systems and how to put them to work for you, or for questions regarding NBIS’s Fleet Insight, contact Joe Doerr or another NBIS risk management specialist today at 1.877.860.RMSS (7677).
Critical telematics take-aways

Telematics gives insurers the ability to triage the claim earlier and more effectively.
Telematics offers a wealth of data that your insurer can use to analyze the claim quickly and more efficiently.
Telematics can help determine accurate causation factors which can help protect the policyholder.
Telematics can detect fraud on a number of fronts.
Telematics can help with vehicle retrieval.

General Motors has plans to commercialize the self-driving car in 2019 in the form of a ride-sharing service. However, there’s no concrete plan on how that service will look just yet.
GM CEO Mary Barra commented on the self-driving car ride-sharing service at an Axios event and told the audience the company is keeping its “options open.”

“We’ll deploy the technology in an urban environment, a ride-share environment, next year.
We’ve said we’re either going to do that on our own [or] we’re going to do that with one or more partners. We’re keeping our options open right now,” she said.
GM previously invested in ride-share service Lyft for a network of self-driving cars in 2016. The automaker has since dissolved the partnership but retains its $500 million investment. It’s unclear who GM could potentially partner with for its self-driving car service as many services are also working toward commercializing the technology.
The automaker’s work comes from GM Cruise, formerly Cruise Automation. GM purchased Cruise for a reported $1 billion in 2016 as a way to bolster its self-driving car program. The unit has worked quickly to bring numerous prototype cars to life. The most-recent prototype doesn’t feature a steering wheel or pedals, called the Cruise AV.
Thus far, GM has not received the OK from the federal government to test the Cruise AV since it does not comply with traditional vehicle standards, i.e., bear a steering wheel and pedals. The company continues to test other self-driving car prototypes with a safety driver behind the wheel in various cities across the U.S.

During GM’s second-quarter earnings call, Barra also said the automaker could one day license out its self-driving car technology.
“The key thing is to get the technology developed safely so we can deploy and validate that. And once we do that, we’re going to look at any and all opportunities to really ramp up and maximize the use of the technology to drive shareholder value,” she said.
Thus, GM could one day become a supplier for self-driving car technology.

The idea of “access vs. ownership” has recently become a major trend that impacts consumer models across categories.
According to marketing strategists, Gen Y, Gen Z and even some Gen X consumers are foregoing the American consumerism model in favor of “access” or “partial access” models. In other words, they’re reducing the things they own in favor of experiences like travel.
Nowhere is this dynamic more impactful than in the future of car ownership. Ridesharing companies like Uber and Lyft are already changing traditional transportation paradigms around the world, and fractional or access-based solutions like GetAround and Turo are changing the nature vehicle ownership and car access.
This trend will accelerate as driverless vehicles shift from car ownership to a ride-hailing model. Absorbing the upfront purchase costs and ongoing maintenance of a car you only drive five percent of the time loses appeal in an environment where door-to-door service is available in the palm of your hand.
Recent research from Esurance estimates that families could save $4,146 annually just by using fleet-owned autonomous vehicles instead of owning their own cars.
The shifting consumer trends, combined with the technological innovations, are turning heads in America’s biggest industries. Auto behemoths Ford and General Motors are already tapping the ridesharing space as part of their self-driving initiatives, and Google’s Waymo plans to roll out their robo-taxi service in Phoenix later this year.

While traditional car ownership won’t immediately go away, the trend toward fleet-owned, self-driving cars will only continue to increase.
Your two-car family in the ’burbs may opt for one car, say, and urban one-car homes may get rid of them altogether.
This is a boon for your wallet and a win for the environment — and our wellbeing. On top of saving time, fuel, insurance premiums and high blood pressure (fewer cars means less traffic), here are some of the ways the future of ride-hailing can help shrink our eco-footprint.
More Pedestrian-Friendly Spaces

The greatest promise for driverless cars is removing human error, which accounts for roughly 94 percent of auto accidents.
Roadway infrastructure has long been designed to address this trend, engineering roads and highways to account for human behavior and safety at the lowest common denominator.
Hence, wide enough lanes, rumble strips, medians and guardrails — plus street signs, highway signs, traffic lights and sound buffers are all elements of transportation that will be relegated to the past.
Remove human error from the mix, and these buffers are no longer needed. Highways can be streamlined with narrower roads unobstructed by guardrails, medians and traffic lights, and all that space can be repurposed as parks and bike lanes.
But the most significant change of all: removing parking structures. The cars’ ability to park themselves outside of dense areas may be most impactful. Again, freed-up space could be restored to pedestrian infill (like parks, walkways and trees) or even affordable housing. What were once city blocks choked by concrete could be transformed into tree-lined boulevards.
Think about it this way: L.A. County’s parking infrastructure uses up 14 percent of the city’s space. Imagine if all that space were suddenly relinquished for reuse.
Reduced Emissions
A RethinkX study found that, in a fully-autonomous world, “each car will be used at least 10 times more than individually owned cars,” which means far fewer vehicles will be required for a fleet.
And fewer vehicles mean reduced pollution. According to a 2017 study by University of California, Davis, if self-driving cars are electric and shared, greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by a whopping 80 percent by 2050.
Will Our Eco-Footprint Get Worse Before it Gets Better?
There’s a glaring caveat, however. That same UC Davis study points out that if carpooling doesn’t take off as expected, greenhouse gases could go up in the meantime.  The main concern is that driverless cars could increase our tolerance for distance traveled, which significantly increases pollution.

If people are willing to travel further away, then housing developments may flourish in remote areas.
That’s a win for affordable housing, but a loss for our eco-footprint.
Also troubling is the possibility of “zombie” cars on the road — that is, cars driving without passengers, doing things like picking up groceries and running errands.
And unless a pricing system is in place which accounts for negative externalities (like carbon taxes or other fuel consumption charges), passengers may not be inclined to travel with others or rideshare.
Chip manufacturers are aware of this issue. Nvidia, just announced an artificial intelligence chip that they say “crams $10,000 worth of power into a tiny box that costs just $1,299.”
What would otherwise need 1,000 watts to run trillions of operations now only uses 30 watts, and the brightest minds in the world are already working on new technology to get to “reversible” or “zero-energy” computing.
Like all innovations, there are side effects – both positive and negative.
For example, we’ve seen tremendous benefits from the automobile, as well as its unintended side effects. Cars have made traveling remarkably convenient, but they also spurred urban sprawl and caused pollution.
But nonetheless, fewer people have been getting their drivers licenses since 1983. One of the main the reasons for this is — you guessed it — the cost of owning and maintaining a car when you can easily get rides from others.
It’s not difficult to fathom how self-driving cars can spur that trend exponentially. To get there, however, we need proper oversight, and the onus is ultimately on us as consumers to make smart choices for ourselves and our planet.

California recently became the first state in the nation to regulate the transportation pollution produced by the surge in popularity of ridesharing after Gov. Brown signed Senate Bill 1014, a bill requiring transportation network companies (TNCs) to account for, and reduce, the greenhouse gas emissions of their operations.
The explosive growth of ride-hailing companies has left states facing a growing list of unintended consequences caused by on-demand transportation companies like Uber and Lyft.

S.B. 1014, sponsored by Assembly Member Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley), requires state regulators to quantify emissions from ridesharing vehicles and set emission targets for TNCs, while requiring companies to develop plans to reduce those emissions.

By prioritizing trips made in zero-emission vehicles, ridesharing companies can help popularize clean transportation, and help California meet its goal. Studies show ride-hailing services have grown at the expense of public transit use and walking and biking.
In San Francisco, it’s estimated that TNC companies produce the same amount of greenhouse gas emissions as 100,000 households in a year. That’s a big problem in California, where transportation emissions, the largest source of emissions in the state, have hit their highest level in 10 years and are threatening the state’s ability to meet its climate goals.
A new national study found that in nine major metro areas, TNCs have added 5.7 billion miles of driving annually. Brown signed the bill aboard a plug-in hybrid electric ferry in San Francisco Bay as part of a package of legislation aimed at boosting zero-emissions vehicles and getting dirty cars and trucks off the road.
“Whether we travel by car, bus or boat, the need to move to zero-emission transportation is urgent,” said Brown.

More individuals in larger cities may decide to utilize ride sharing services as opposed to owning a car in the future, but that does not seem the case for people who live in suburban and rural areas.
It’s a lifestyle choice, said Benard Swiecki, director of automotive communities at the Center For Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Ride sharing is a car service that allows a person to use a smartphone app to arrange for a ride in a privately owned vehicle instead of a taxi. The advantage is it’s much cheaper than a taxi for a consumer, and possibly even an alternative to owning a car.
“Your conventional Lyft and Uber services are in major cities,” said Swiecki. “There is a growing usage of those services, however, it is not available in all cities and it does not make sense outside of fairly larger metropolitan areas. It really depends on where the consumer lives and their lifestyle.”

The more urban the area, the more likely an individual will be to use ride sharing or use unconventional rental companies like Zipcar, according to Swiecki. Through Zipcar they can use a vehicle for a designated amount of time and return it when they are finished without going through a rental agency.
“These are all good replacements for owning your own car,” said Swiecki. “However, if you use your car a lot as most people who live in the suburbs, rural areas and little towns do, it just would make more sense to own your own vehicle.”
Lyft, the national ride sharing company, believes that ride sharing does have a significant impact on car ownership.
“Ride sharing has challenged the idea of owning a car,” according to Gwen Belomy, Lyft spokesperson. “Lyft is playing its part to enact change by allowing people to share rides, drive less, own fewer cars, and more easily connect with public transit routes.”
Through Lyft’s annual economic impact report, it found that in 2017 a quarter million people gave up their car and 25 percent of Lyft passengers view a personal vehicle as low in importance to them.
“At Lyft, we believe in building cities around people, not cars,” according to Belomy. “By reducing individual car ownership and sharing the ride, Lyft is working towards a future where transportation ushers in positive changes in our communities and cities. We’re making a strong commitment to shared rides with a goal of 50 percent of our rides being shared by 2020.”

In a study, the researchers used two types of neural networks—computational systems modeled on the human brain—that analyzed patterns of taxi demand. This deep learning approach, which lets computers learn on their own, could then predict the demand patterns significantly better than current technology.
“Ride sharing companys like Uber in the United States, and Didi Chuxing in China, are becoming more and more popular and have really changed the way people approach transportation,” says Jessie Li, associate professor of information sciences and technology at Penn State. “And you can imagine how important it would be to predict the taxi demand because the taxi company could dispatch the cars even before the need arises.”

Better predictions could lessen the time taxis idle waiting for rides, making cities cleaner, the researchers add. Because accidents tend to happen more often in congested areas, better ride prediction technology could also improve safety.
REQUESTS, NOT JUST RIDES
The researchers analyzed a large dataset of ride requests to Didi Chuxing, one of the largest car-hailing companies in China, according to Huaxiu Yao, doctoral student in information sciences and technology and lead author of the paper.
When users need a ride they first make a request through a computer application—for example, a mobile phone app. Using these requests for rides, rather than relying solely on ride data, better reflect overall demand, according to the researchers.
“This is really good data because it’s based on demand,” says Yao. “If you just know how many people took a ride, that doesn’t really tell you the demand because it could be that people didn’t get a ride, or others just gave up trying.”
With the historical data, which includes the time and location of the request, the computer can then predict how the demand will change over time. When visualized on the map, the researchers could see that evolving demand.

“In the morning, for example, you can see that in a residential section there are more pickups, and there are more drop-offs in the downtown area,” says Li. “In the evening, it’s reversed. What we are doing is using historical pickup data to predict how this map changes 30 minutes from now, one hour from now, and so on.”
The researchers, who presented their findings at the recent AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, used data on taxi requests in Guangzhou, China, from February 1 to March 26, 2017. Guangzhou residents make about 300,000 ride requests each day. By comparison, there are about 500,000 rides per day in New York City.
LET THE COMPUTER DO IT
While technology uses one type of neural network, the researchers combined two neural networks—the convolutional neural network, or CNN, and Long Short Term Memory network, or LSTM—to help guide the complex sequences of predictions. CNNs can better model complex spatial correlations and LSTMs can better handle sequential modeling.
“Basically, we used a very complicated neural net to simulate how people digest information, in this case, the image of the traffic patterns,” says Li.
Li says access to larger data sets—”big data”—and advances in computer technology that can process this large amount of data have helped this project and enabled other deep learning developments.
“In traditional computer programming, people need to tell the computer what aspects—or features—it needs to look at and then they have to model it, which takes a huge effort,” says Li. “Why deep learning is revolutionary is now we can skip that step. You can just give the computer the images, for example. You don’t need to tell the computer what it needs to look at.”
Additional researchers contributed from Penn State; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; and Didi Chuxing.

Uber is the latest company to bring dockless bike-sharing to Chicago.
Uber announced Friday that it will launch its dockless electric bike-sharing service Jump on Chicago’s South Side starting Monday. It’s taking part in the City of Chicago’s dockless bike-share pilot program, joining Lime, Pace and Ofo—three other services that have been testing their dockless bikes on the city’s far South Side.
Jump bikes are equipped with an electric motor that provides a boost whenever you pedal. The bikes cost $2 for a 30-minute ride, and can be accessed through the Uber app or the Jump mobile app.
But perhaps most importantly, Jump bikes are equipped with “lock-to” technology, meaning they come with an integrated “U-bolt” lock that a user can lock to bike racks or street signs when done riding. This allows the company to comply with Chicago’s rule that companies must provide locking infrastructure so that dockless bikes don’t clutter city streets and sidewalks.

Jump, which is also available in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Santa Cruz and Sacramento, says that less than 1% of rides have resulted in parking complaints.
“Our mission at Jump is to get more people on bikes, so they have affordable and convenient ways to move around without needing a car,” Ryan Rzepecki, co-founder and CEO of Jump bikes, said in a statement. “We’re excited to bring our bikes to the South Side of Chicago, and help support Uber’s commitment to service every corner of the city.”
Uber acquired Jump in April for around $200 million. The dockless bike and scooter industry has exploded this year as several companies have popped up in cities across the country looking to provide new transportation options to city dwellers.
Venture capitalists, fearful of missing out on the hottest transportation innovation since Uber and Lyft, are pouring money into dockless bikes and electric scooters. Bird, an electric scooter company, just raised $300 million at a $2 billion valuation. Lime is reportedly raising a $250 million round of its own.
Uber’s Jump bikes will be available Monday in Chicago’s bike-sharing pilot area, which serves neighborhoods such as Auburn Gresham, Chatham, Calumet Heights, Roseland, Pullman, Hegewisch, Beverly, Morgan Park, and Mt. Greenwood.

HYUNDAI owners will soon be able to earn thousands for simply not using their car.

The South Korean car maker has joined forces with local car sharing company Car Next Door which allows properly vetted users to rent nearby vehicles either by the hour or the day.
Hyundai is currently developing its next-generation infotainment technology that will integrate the Car Next Door peer-to-peer car sharing app into its vehicles so owners can easily rent their cars out when they are not in use.
The car sharing company suggests that the average mid-size vehicle can earn upwards of $3000 a year while van owners can expect more than double that figure.
The in-built functionality will do away with a traditional key, allowing renters to access and drive Hyundais enrolled in the scheme with only a smartphone.


Hyundai will roll out the next-generation technology in 2019, with Hyundai Australia chief operating officer Scott Grant hoping that it will allow customers to earn some extra cash.

“By the end of 2019, Australians will be able to buy a Hyundai car with the built-in ability to seamlessly and easily rent it out and earn extra money,” Grant says.
“This capability will be pre-installed and integrated into a new version of Hyundai’s Auto Link unit, making it a simple matter to earn extra funds via Car Next Door’s innovative car sharing platform.”
Car Next Door founder Will Davies added that the program allows users to have a car whenever they need one while owners can cover the growing costs of ownership.

“Fuel prices, economic pressures and rapid changes in vehicle technology are all supporting the development of connected cars and the sharing economy”, stated Davis. “So you can have a car when you need one, but when you’re not using it, the vehicle is out there making you money.”


The move by Hyundai is part of a growing trend among car manufacturers that are looking to expand beyond the traditional new car sales methods.


Last year Holden launched its Maven service that allows Uber drivers to rent vehicles directly from the brand rather than purchasing them outright. The rental price — that starts from $215 a week — includes insurance and maintenance and has no kilometre limit or extra fees.

However, in the US Maven rents out GM owned vehicles to regular road users not just Uber drivers. And much like the upcoming Hyundai-Car Next Door partnership the linked cars are accessible to registered users by smartphone.
But now, according to a Bloomberg report earlier this year, Maven is trialling peer-to-peer car sharing that allows individual owners to rent out their vehicles to other users.
Overseas, several car companies have aligned with ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft to help develop driverless cars and to plan for the next phase of new cars sales once autonomous vehicles become more commonplace and private car ownership recedes.

Business travellers around the world feel marginally safer in taxis than in ride-sharing services, according to research commissioned by Carlson Wagonlit Travel, the global travel management company.
Around two in five (39%) business travellers surveyed said they feel somewhat or very vulnerable about their personal safety in ride-sharing services, compared with 36% for taxis.
Business travellers from Asia-Pacific are the most concerned overall: 43% feel worried using ride-sharing services and 39% when taking a taxi. In the Americas, the numbers are 40% and 39% respectively, and in Europe 34% and 28%.
“In cities across the globe, using ride-sharing services has become a way of life,” said Bindu Bhatia,managing director, Asia-Pacific, Carlson Wagonlit Travel. “The familiar and convenient experience they provide has made them a preferred mode of transport for many business travellers. Still, one continues to hear about safety incidents surrounding ride-sharing services around the world, which might explain in part why some travellers are worried about using them.”
Female business travellers in Europe and Asia-Pacific are more likely to feel nervous about personal safety in ride-sharing services or taxis than men.
Looking at ride-sharing, 56% of Asia-Pacific women feel very/somewhat nervous versus 38% of men. For taxis, that is 48% and 35% respectively. In Europe, the differences are less pronounced. For ride-sharing, the numbers are 38% for females versus 31% for males. For taxis, it is 36% versus 22%. In the Americas, there is no statistical difference between genders.
Even though ride-sharing is associated with the younger generation, the findings show that these travellers are more concerned about personal safety. Millennials, in all regions, are the most worried, followed by gen X travelers and baby boomers.
In Asia-Pacific, half of the millennial travellers are very/somewhat concerned when using a ride-share service, followed by 44% of gen X and 35% of boomers. In the Americas, the percentages are 47% for millennials, 42% for gen X and 29% for boomers. In Europe, the numbers drop to 44%, 34% and 21%, respectively.
These differences might be down to gender. According to the research, gender differences appear to track the differences seen between generations. This may be because males are more likely to travel for business the older they get, but the opposite is true of female business travellers. The younger women are, the more likely they are to travel for business.
The sharing economy presents both opportunities and challenges for corporate travel programs. In some cities ride-sharing services can be considerably cheaper than taxis or car rental services, while also providing greater convenience to travellers. On the other hand, traveller safety and the legality of these services in various markets remain important concerns. As a result, corporate travel policies around the sharing economy can vary widely from one company to the next.
“Ride-sharing services may be right for some corporate travel programs but not for others,” said Bhatia. “Whether the sharing economy is a good fit for a company will depend on their company culture, their traveller demographics and their risk management policies, among other things. Either way, companies should create travel policies that define if, when and how travellers can use these services, and communicate these clearly to their employees.”

As the car-sharing market in Japan rapidly expands, major carmakers have been pressing down on the accelerator to get a share of the business.
Against a backdrop of consumers shifting away from owning their own vehicle to sharing one, the carmaker business model centred on vehicle production and sales has reached a turning point.
In an underground carpark in Tokyo’s Shinjuku area, three Nissan Motor vehicles used in the carmaker’s car-sharing service are lined up together.
By completing a membership registration in advance and reserving a vehicle through a smartphone, a car can be borrowed for fees that start from 200 yen (S$2.50) for 15 minutes.
Nissan, which entered the car-sharing business in January, has 44 vehicles available in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and elsewhere, and plans to add to the fleet.
According to the Foundation for Promoting Personal Mobility and Ecological Transportation, car-sharing services in Japan have over 1.32 million registered members, about a fivefold increase from five years ago.

An official of Park24, which operates the nation’s largest car-sharing service Times Car Plus, said one reason for the rapid growth was the spread of smartphones, which have made it easy to search for available vehicles and make reservations.
 In the greater Tokyo area where car-sharing has spread, there has been a notable drop in car ownership in recent years. In 2011, 71.2 per cent of households in the area had a private vehicle; last year, this figure fell to 64.6 per cent.

Expecting the car-sharing market to continue growing, Honda also entered the business in earnest in November. Toyota has formed a tie-up with Park24 and is pushing ahead with a trial, in which rented vehicles can be returned to a different place from where they were picked up.
The trend has industry insiders worried. “If more people share vehicles, sales will go down,” one major carmaker official said.
But behind the carmakers’ efforts to strengthen their presence in services, including the car-sharing business, lies a shared sense of crisis that they must avoid being left behind as the market expands.

With the robust penetration of smart technologies in the transit space, smart transportation market has been progressing at a prodigious pace in the recent years. The growth can be aptly credited to the efforts of the automotive industry players that have been striving to bring in innovative products to the masses.
However, the governmental bureaucracy is also to be accredited with some appreciation, given that these authorized bodies have been extensively adopting smart technologies to solve traffic problems, in addition to providing substantial financial support for modernizing transportation.
Urban planners along with technology experts are focusing on building smart cities that will use automated transportation, smart grids, artificial intelligence and digital sensors. Such cities are expected to become a hub for the expansion of the smart transportation industry.

Furthermore, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) will also be playing a major role in popularizing smart transport, extending its reach across the masses.
Indeed, it is being speculated that smart transportation market will emerge as one of most revolutionizing business spaces of the 21st century.
China, the biggest automotive market across the globe, has been highly proactive in improvising its automobiles, thereby emerging as a pivotal contributor in smart transportation market.
The nation has seemingly deployed intelligent transportation systems such as traffic signal control systems, variable message signs, car navigation, speed cameras and automatic number plate recognition.
This is being done primarily to update transportation systems and resolve various social issues that are often indirectly related to poor transportation. In fact, one of the most iconic instances demonstrating China’s proactiveness in smart transportation industry is the construction of an intelligent highway equipped with battery chargers, solar panels and mapping sensors all along the 1.08 km stretch.
China also aims at ensuring that at least 10% of all automobiles across the country are electric vehicles. This would warrant that smart highway projects such as the aforementioned are always on the run, thereby providing an added growth avenue for smart transportation industry.
The Intelligent Transport System Association of China has recently even declared an investment of USD 30 billion in the intelligent transport industry by 2020 that would help construct electronic charging systems and encourage green transport system.
Dubai has recently joined the trend of smart city development. Apparently, under the umbrella of the Dubai Plan 2021, the government is aiming at transforming infrastructure, designing ambitious projects and providing citizens with enhanced benefits.
The regional smart transportation market has witnessed increased investment under the Dubai Plan, as transportation is being viewed as a key pillar to the development of a smart city.
The Roads and Transport Authority of Dubai has implemented unique smart car rentals that can be collected by tech-savvy commuters on an hourly basis and returned to kiosks located close to metro stations.
Apparently, estimates claim that 40% of slow traffic movement in Dubai is caused by drivers looking for a parking spot. On these grounds, intelligent parking systems are being developed that will guide drivers to find parking spots near their destination.
Safety of bus commuters is also being developed by the installation of a system of buses that will assess the physical condition of the driver and identify signs of exhaustion or illness. It has been estimated that IoT technologies can amplify Dubai’s potential value to reach $5 billion by 2019.

Smart technology, ideally, is still a long time away from reaching market maturation.
 
Besides, even regulatory systems have much progress to make with regards to helping existing roads adapt to the new smart mode of travel.
However, smart transit systems offer ubiquitous connectivity, remote sensors, dynamic traffic signals and vehicular communications – commendable social and economic benefits that are certain to aid smart transportation industry emerge as a mainstream vertical.
Experts point out that between 2035 and 2045, the advent of autonomous vehicles can save around 585,000 lives while reducing commuting time by 250 million hours per year on a global basis. Also, machine directed vehicles are likely to stray from distractions and will contribute towards improving highway safety.
According to certain statistics, autonomous vehicle technology is expected to add $7 trillion to the global economy by 2050 when they will come to constitute more than half the new vehicles sold worldwide.
In the forthcoming years, vehicle ownership is likely to be displaced with the rapid proliferation of Mobility-as-a-Service technology. Smart transportation market size is expected to witness an altogether new scenario of ride-hailing services and pilotless vehicle options, revolutionizing the automotive & transportation space in its entirety.
As per estimates, smart transportation industry size is anticipated to increase commendably in the ensuing years, with a target valuation of USD 130 billion by 2024.

Carsharing provides many social, economic, and environmental benefits, such as reduced household costs, increased access to transportation for lower-income households, less traffic congestion, and lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions.
However, existing urban transportation systems do not always offer “affirmative action” for shared mobility, especially in cities where competition for space is at a premium.
Designating parking spaces exclusively for shared cars offers physical infrastructure as well as visible support for shared mobility. More importantly, it encourages more car sharing by offering a more convenient and cost-effective service for users.
In 2010, the city of San Francisco amended its planning code to incentivize car sharing by incorporating two new development approval requirements:

Newly constructed buildings incorporating residential uses or existing buildings being converted to residential use must provide a certain number of permanent car-share parking spaces depending on expected numbers of residences.
Specific nonresidential developments must also dedicate a percentage of their parking spaces to “short-term, transient use by vehicles from certified carsharing organizations” or similar programs.

Subsequently, and as reported by a 2014 SFGate article, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) announced in 2014 that 900 of 281,000 on-street spaces would be set aside for use by customers of car-sharing firms Zipcar, City CarShare (a local nonprofit now merged with Getaround), and Getaround (a leader in peer-to-peer car sharing).

The policy ensures that spaces are located in all socioeconomic areas by requiring that at least 30 percent of spaces are in the city’s periphery and by offering lower prices for those spots.
The SFTMA’s January 2017 carsharing parking pilot evaluation report found that “placing carshare spaces on-street increases shared vehicle access, convenience, and visibility.”
As a result of participating in car sharing, 17 percent of members who owned a car reported selling or donating one. In addition, on-street car-share vehicles were used dramatically more (six hours per day versus one) and by more people (19 versus two per month) than private vehicles.
Also, the data “showed that 80 percent of the on-street carshare spaces were shared between more than 10 people monthly.”
These policy measures highlight important challenges and opportunities. For instance, city support of car sharing through designated off-street parking must be communicated carefully.
Though only a small percentage of on-street spots were made available to car-sharing organizations — and they pay the city for spaces — a 2014 Streetsblog article noted that the policy created a perception among some residents that public space was being gifted to private companies.
The public benefits of car sharing — and how it can be supported by designating spaces — is an important communication challenge, especially in cities where parking spaces are scarce.
In addition, the off-street parking ordinance permits only round-trip car-sharing organizations to use designated spaces, not one-way car-sharing services like Car2Go, where vehicles can be left anywhere and not just at the point of origin. Policymakers should consider supporting all modes of car sharing, including one-way options.

Through its ReachNow mobility unit, BMW is offering both ride and car sharing services through a single app, allowing users to choose whether they want to drive a car or hail a ride to a destination. In addition to on-demand car service, the app also allows users to schedule a pick-up for later, all using the ReachNow app.
“From day one, we’ve said that car sharing alone isn’t enough to solve the transportation challenges facing major cities. There are plenty of use cases for how people take advantage of a matrix of transit solutions – from bikes and buses to ride share and ferries – to make their way around their world every day,” said Dr. Simon Broesamle, Chief Customer Officer at ReachNow.
“As the first company to bring together car sharing and ride hailing into one app, the new ReachNow experience is an important step in our commitment to a multimodal future.”
This newest iteration of the ReachNow app is being offered to customers in Seattle. The “Drive” portion of the software provides free-floating car sharing allowing users to drive themselves to their destinations.  The “Ride” portion of the app resembles other ride hailing services.
Shared fleet
BMW says that using the same cars in a sharing app will lead to greater utilization of the existing fleet rather than adding new vehicles to the road.  “For mobility services, a key metric is the number of trips a member takes with a service,” says Dr. Bernhard Blättel, Vice President Mobility Services BMW Group.

“ReachNow’s multimodal service offering gives members more choice in how they get where they need to be by seamlessly integrating multiple services into one app.
We believe this approach is critical to increasing loyalty, as members have no need to look elsewhere for their mobility needs.”
If members choose the drive app, they can select from BMW, BMW i and Mini vehicles in the ReachNow fleet and pay by the minute, hour or the day. They can schedule a vehicle pickup as soon as 20 minutes or up to 7 days in advance.
Once a car is held, the destination is set on the in-car navigation. Members can also engage features like “Park & Keep” if they have additional need for the vehicle or “End Trip.” Rates vary from 45 cents per minute, $15 for the first hour, $50 for three hours and $80 per day. Parking time is billed at 10 cents per minute during paused trips.
Riders can also use the app to personalize the comfort by selecting temperature and music preferences of their hailed ride as well as a “quiet time” feature for those who do not want to be disturbed during their trip.
Existing members who have the ReachNow mobility app can upgrade to the new Ride services by doing an update and new members can waive the $15 sign-up fee. ReachNow Ride pricing starts at $3.24 minimum per ride incurred at $2.40 per mile plus 40 cents per minute with no surge pricing. BMW will also be testing the Drive only portion of the app in New York City and Portland, Oregon.

New AI research suggests that self-driving cars could one day travel at speed through junctions without needing to slow down or stop.
The successful technology would mean an end to traffic lights and waiting at junctions, as artificial intelligence lets cars weave through junctions while avoiding other vehicles and pedestrians.
The research comes from the Autonomous Systems Lab at the SRM Institute of Science and Technology in India.
The technology at the heart of the idea relies on ‘Vehicle to Vehicle’ (V2V) and ‘Vehicle to everything’ (V2X) communication, which allows cars and objects to communicate with each other.
The paper aims to find an artificial intelligence which can work with cars to allow them “to traverse across the intersection in minimum time whilst also ensuring that none of the vehicles collide with other vehicles and/or obstacles”.

The seemingly easy task of navigating cars at speed actually requires lots of computation power.
In seconds, AI will need to find a route which is both as fast and as smooth as possible as it negotiates with other cars on the road.
While the idea of a non-stop journey would mean a welcome reduction in travel time, the research suggests there are still many problems to overcome before we see the technology on the road.
Most urgently, there is no established method for self-driving cars to share their routes with other cars or with an ‘intersection manager’ that would make the calculations.
With data privacy at the top of everyone’s agenda, the paper also warns that the information needed to calculate these routes might mean an infringement of ‘vehicle privacy’.
Instead, the paper suggests that each car would have to make its own calculations as it manoeuvres, and that lanes should be removed altogether as cars share all available space.
All of these problems are an important consideration for getting zero collision and minimum time as the vehicle traverses the intersection, the paper concludes.
“An optimal trade-off between many of the factors will have to be achieved.”

It’s this sentiment that led Steven Johnson to write in The New York Times Magazine that “The Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain.”
To some, this is an extraordinary statement given Bitcoin’s peak market cap of more than $200 billion; however, the reality is that the blockchain’s use cases are so profound and its network so adaptable that it creates cascading value across virtually every industry.
To facilitate blockchain adoption, several of the world’s most prominent car companies are coming together to develop standards and provide resources for initiatives relevant to their industry.
In early May, BMW, General Motors, Ford, and others formed the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI), a nonprofit collective focused on making “mobility services more efficient, affordable, greener, safer, and less congested by promoting standards and accelerating adoption of blockchain, distributed ledger, and related technologies.”

MOBI views blockchain technology as a differentiator in the transportation industry. It has implications for the complicated and costly automaker supply chain to existential user-generated costs regarding usage or pollution taxes. The broad array of use cases is reflected in the diverse partners participating in the project.
In addition to the headliners from the auto industry, MOBI includes tech giant IBM and consulting juggernaut Accenture. Both companies made significant pivots toward blockchain technology, and their participation both reflects their belief in the technology’s future and their desire to be a part of helping it come to fruition.
Interestingly, the collective isn’t limited just to industry titans. A collection of blockchain startups including ShareRingand IOTA are also a part of this burgeoning imitative. Both companies feature ancillary services related to the auto industry, and their involvement reflects MOBI’s desire to see blockchain technology integrated throughout the auto ecosystem, not just at the very top.
ShareRing, a blockchain startup focused on the sharing economy, is an interesting collaborator for MOBI. ShareRing intends to serve as the Amazon of the sharing economy in the sense that it provides a unified platform for an otherwise disparate ecosystem. Using their mobile app, anyone can identify opportunities, pay for services, and provide ratings and feedback.
Its connection to MOBI and the auto industry is found in the company’s most obvious use case.  ShareRings’s founders have their origins in the car sharing business, and a significant portion of the sharing economy deals with transportation.
Uber and Lyft are two of the most recognizable names associated with this ecosystem, and they are both transportation driven. Their decentralized marketplace reflects many of the blockchain’s most lauded features, and these markets should proliferate as they achieve broader adoption.

Meanwhile, IOTA is building blockchain protocols that enable the Internet of Things (IoT) to thrive in the blockchain era. Increasingly, IoT includes self-driving car initiatives that can be secured and powered by blockchain technology. IOTA’s technological contributions can help MOBI’s partners more quickly make the driverless car a tangible, safe reality.
Ultimately, this new collective is a well-funded, well-managed group that is ripe with talent and ambition. It’s headed by Chris Ballinger, a former C-suite executive at the Toyota Research Institute, and their advisory board includes a plethora of prominent blockchain leaders.
Although the auto industry is mostly known for competition and brand loyalty, when it comes to blockchain technology, these companies are coming together to make sure that everyone can reap the benefits of this transformative, next-generation tech.

New York City is the first major U.S. city to limit private companies from providing ride-share services to customers as cities and states across the country debate how to regulate the growing industry.
The New York City Council last month voted to limit the number of ride share vehicles provided by companies such as Uber and Lyft. The two companies provide the greatest number of such transportation services, but at least 10 other companies are emerging in the high-tech areas of San Francisco Bay,  Austin, Texas, and elsewhere.
Ride-share services, which have grown in popularity in metropolitan areas, allow commuters to choose peer-to-peer car services like carpooling and car sharing as an alternative to using public transportation or taxis.
The New York law imposes a year-long freeze on new licenses in the largest market that Uber and Lyft service. Since 2015, the number of registered ride-sharing vehicles has increased from 12,600 to 80,000, according to city data.

The City Council’s move “will bring New Yorkers back to an era of struggling to get a ride, particularly for communities of color and in the outer boroughs,” Lyft said in a statement.
Following New York City’s lead, a similar proposal surfaced in the Chicago City Council, where aldermen in favor of limits cite increased traffic. According to city data, in the last three years the number of ride-share vehicles providing four or more trips per month quadrupled from about 15,000 to nearly 66,000.
While ride-sharing offers commuters convenience and a revenue source for drivers, two city aldermen argue that the benefits don’t outweigh the cost of what they called “ridiculous” traffic congestion.
Alderman Anthony Beale, 9th District, and Alderman Edward Burke, 14th, are considering a proposal that would cap ride-share vehicles and increase pay for drivers.
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s brother is an Uber investor, and argues that competition is better for the city. Emanuel pushed through a ride-share tax increase, which his office said has helped fund the Chicago Transit Authority’s efforts to upgrade its security cameras and rails.
“For decades the taxi industry had a monopoly in this city, but good luck getting a taxi to pick you up or drop you off on the South or West sides,” mayoral spokesman Matt McGrath told the Chicago Tribune. “That’s another kind of cap, an industry-imposed cap that existed forever.”


Christopher Lentino, director of outreach at Illinois Policy Institute, agrees.


“It’s a shame that Chicago is considering capping ride-sharing after years of trying countless other means to squash competition,” Lentino told Watchdog.org.
“Rather than creating a competitive atmosphere among the cab industry and ride-sharing industry, Chicago has decided to travel the path of greatest oppression by blaming an industry for the ills of the city. As we’ve seen with the cab industry, capping licensure only serves to artificially inflate prices, which, in turn, makes it harder for working individuals to make a living.”
Lentino said a better resolution would be to ease regulations for everyone in the industry.
“Instead of immediately jumping to more oppressive regulation, Chicago should take a step back and examine the current system and ease regulations on all,” he said. “A competitive marketplace is a boon for taxpayers.”
As local governments continue to grapple with regulating a growing industry, city councils in Seattle, Oklahoma City, Duluth City, and Roseburg, Oregon, introduced regulations, and in some cases, limited ride-sharing services. A lawsuit over ride sharing in Austin and San Antonio ended up being settled by the Texas Supreme Court.
Last year, Florida joined at least 30 other states by adopting a ride-share law. After four years of debate, the governor signed into law ride-sharing guidelines that went into effect July 1, 2017. The legislation grew out of a patchwork of regulations implemented by municipalities to oversee and tax transportation services. Differing rules created confusion and prohibited companies and users from using mobile apps and traveling from one area to another under conflicting rules.
The new law requires all personal ride-sharing services to perform a background check on all drivers, provide operation audits to the state every two years, and provide information on digital networks to local and state governments.



It also requires ride-sharing companies to carry $100,000 of insurance for bodily injury or death and $25,000 for property damage while a driver is logged onto their app without a passenger. Driving with a passenger requires $1 million in coverage.



More than one year after the law went into effect, local municipalities are raising concerns about the state’s ability to enforce it. Critics note that an undefined gray zone exists for the 40,000 Uber drivers in Florida. In some cases, they could not be in compliance with Florida law, but at the same time not act illegally.
According to Hillsborough County regulators, Uber drivers aren’t in compliance with the rules that govern for-hire vehicles. Uber continues to operate under its current insurance model while the state has yet to weigh in on its validity.
To date, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (FOIR) and the state department have not fully recognized Uber’s insurance policy as legal and in compliance until the Legislature amends the statute. Florida Highway Patrol Capt. Nancy Rasmussen, a spokeswoman for the state department, told the Tampa Bay Times that until the state Legislature determines whether Uber is operating as a taxi service or as a ride-share and is given its own definition under “transportation network companies,” the department is unable to answer questions about its coverage.
A similar issue arose in New York, when a court ruled that Uber drivers were not employees, but contract workers, which affected insurance and taxation regulations.
State Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, and other legislators have expressed an interest in addressing the issue by passing new regulations in next year’s session.
Brandes, who sponsored the bill that became law with Rep. Chris Sprowls, R-Clearwater, received overwhelming bipartisan support. Brandes maintains, “The future of transportation options includes a focus on shared mobility, and as we move closer to autonomous vehicles on our roadways, the future of ride-sharing is very bright.”

Hyundai Motor secured a bridgehead into the US considered the biggest future car market while investing in Migo, a car sharing information provider in the US. The investment in Migo is the sixth investment deal related to the sharing economy since launching a car sharing service using the Ioniq Electric Car in the Netherlands in October of last year.
Hyundai said on September 11 that the carmaker inked a strategic investment deal to cooperate with Migo, a US-based provider of vehicle sharing information. The amount and method of investment were not disclosed.

Migo was established in 2016 and launched a multiple mobility integration service for the first time in the US the following year.
The multiple mobility integration service connects users to vehicle-sharing companies through smartphone applications.
When a user enters his or her destination, the user can get information such as service fees and riding time of representative car sharing companies in the US such as Car2Go and Zipcar. Migo receives commissions from car sharing companies.
Since its service launches in Seattle and Portland, the company has expanded its service coverage to 75 major US cities including New York, LA, Washington and Chicago.
Hyundai plans to acquire know-how in the overall mobility business of the US and secure capabilities and technology in order to lead the future mobility market with this strategic investment in Migo as momentum.
The Korean automaker is the only automobile company among companies that invested in Migo so expects huge synergies out of cooperation between the two companies.
The US mobility market, the largest in the world, is expected to continue to grow while riding on the back of rapid growth. The company expects the US$47 billion US mobility market to reach US$292 billion in 2025 and US$458 billion in 2030.
Hyundai Motor lagged behind global automakers such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the car sharing market over the past two years.
So the Korean carmaker is accelerating its moves in the market. Its partnership with Migo earned Hyundai a mobility business belt that links America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.

In Europe, Hyundai Motor is engaging in the car sharing business using the Ioniq EV in Amsterdam of the Netherlands.
In the Asia-Pacific region, the automaker made preemptive investment in Indian car sharing company Revv, last-mile logistics service company Mesh Korea in Korea, Grab, the largest car hailing company in South East Asia and Immotor, a Shenzhen-based startup specializing in the e-scooter and battery-sharing business in China and Car Next Door, a P2P car sharing company in Australia.

Could Canadian insurers cut auto claims costs by 15% by using telematics? Perhaps, if they could somehow import the experience of European insurers.
An unnamed European insurer compared its auto insurance customers who were using telematics with its customers who were not, Nino Tarantino, North American CEO for Octo, said in an interview Thursday with Canadian Underwriter.
The loss ratio was 12% to 18% lower for the motorists who were using telematics compared to those who were not. Tarantino told Canadian Underwriter the results of the comparison were presented at a conference he attended; the presenter did not want to release the results publicly, he said.

Telematics refers to technology that records data such as a vehicle’s speed, location and driving behaviour (such as sudden acceleration and hard braking).
Data gleaned from telematics is being used by some Canadian insurers (such as Desjardins, under the Ajusto brand) to offer discounts on premiums to motorists who are perceived as low-risk.
The Financial Services Commission of Ontario told Canadian Underwriter earlier that FSCO has “no studies or reviews that provide actuarial evidence to quantify” the effectiveness of usage-based insurance in the province. FSCO lets Ontario auto insurers reduce rates for good driving behaviour but does not let them charge motorists more for bad driving behaviour.
There are several reasons why telematics can cut claims costs for an insurer, Tarantino said Thursday.
For example, telematics can reduce the cost of adjusting the claim because the claim can be closed quicker, said Tarantino. This is because the telematics device detects the accident and helps with collision reconstruction. Since telematics monitors exactly what happens to a vehicle at any given time, the technology can also discourage motorists from making fraudulent claims.
The unnamed European insurer providing the loss ratio comparison “was showing that, in the case of segments that are riskier – like teenagers, or very high powered cars – the improvement in the loss ratio was 16 to 18%,” said Tarantino. He was in Detroit last week attending the TU Automotive conference and trade show.

Canadian auto insurers offering telematics include Desjardins, CAA, The Co-operators and Intact.
Early adopters of UBI were Tier 1 insurers, Tarantino observed, but smaller and mid-sized insurers are also becoming interested. “They know that if they are not doing a pilot or learning how to use this data in the next five to 10 years, they may be out because they may be left with all the bad drivers and all the high risk customers,” he said.
Octo is the vendor CAA Insurance will use with MyPace, an auto insurance product approved by Ontario’s regulator that CAA plans to launch in Ontario next month. CAA will use telematics to measure distance driven and is aiming the product at motorists who drive 9,000 or fewer kilometres a year.
Clients who select MyPace “will start with a base rate and be charged in 1,000 kilometre increments,” CAA Insurance president Matthew Turack said during the MyPace launch. With MyPace, rates will not be based on any driving behaviour other than distance travelled.
Octo announced Thursday that Tarantino was named Influencer of the Year at TU Automotive Detroit.

Uber has made a “sizeable” investment in California-based scooter-sharing startup Lime, as part of the company’s latest $US335 million ($454.08 million) funding round.
According to a Bloomberg report, the investment, led by Alphabet Inc’s venture arm GV, values Lime at $US1.1 billion ($1.36 billion).
The raise also included IVP, the Fidelity Management and Research Company, and Atomico, as well as some of Lime’s existing investors. GV general partner Joe Kraus will also take a position on Lime’s board.
Details of the partnership have not been released, but a statement from Lime called Uber’s contribution “sizable”, and described the ride-sharing giant as a “strategic partner”.

Lime provides dock-less electric scooters, as well as electric and pedal-powered bikes, for short-term ‘last-mile’ rentals, with the partnership and investment meaning Uber will make Lime bikes and scooters available on its mobile platform, while scooters will be ‘co-branded’ with Uber’s logo.
Founded in January last year, the startup now has electric scooters and both electric and pedal-powered bikes in 70 markets in the US and Europe, with more than 6 million users worldwide.
The startup will use the new funds to further expand, globally, while also improving its infrastructure and developing new technologies and products.
The partnership may represent a change in tack for Uber, in terms of its ambitions in the scooter-sharing space. According to the Bloomberg report, Uber has previously filed an application in San Francisco to launch a scooter-sharing business of its own, however it is unclear currently whether those plans are still underway.
This raise for a US-based bike and scooter-sharing company comes after bike-sharing operator oBike announced it would be leaving Melbourne, and ofo announced it will be withdrawing from Australia. These exits raised questions about why the model, which seems so popular elsewhere, doesn’t seem to work in Australian cities.

Renault said on Wednesday it would launch its new service in September – a move that comes just as Autolib charging stations are stripped from the streets of Paris.
It plans to have up to 2,000 Zoé and Twizy model electric cars on the streets of Paris by the end of the year.
The carmaker is one of a number of companies hoping to capitalise on the early demise of the public enterprise Autolib whose fleet of distinctive grey cars will disappear by the end of this month after being mired in a debt crisis.
 

France’s PSA group – the makers of Peugeot and Citroën vehicles – also hopes to get a piece of the action by putting 500 cars on the streets of Paris by December while car hire firm Ada is looking at deploying a fleet of around 50 cars in the 11th and 12th arrondissements.
While downtown Paris residents may welcome the news of replacement services for Autolib, critics say the new program is too city-centric and won’t have anything like the reach of the failed service which was present in around 100 communes.
The Greens chief in Paris City Hall, David Belliard, said Renault had failed to address whether its service would be available in the greater metropolitan area.
In comments quoted by BFMTV, the politician said private operators would “assure you they would provide a public service and go where they are really needed” but in the end their business was “making a profit”.
From the right side of the political divide, Florence Berthout with the Republicans criticised the fact the city was rushing headlong into “another system about which we don’t really know anything”.
“Above all, the greater metropolitan area and the region are being ignored,” she said.
Renault have yet to provide pricing details for their new service, but it is known the cars will be able to use the 3,244 parking places made vacant by the departure of Autolib, as will other new competitors in the carsharing market.
Unlike with Autolib, users of the service will not be able to reserve parking spots. However, the cars’ GPS will guide drivers to available locations.
The Autolib contract was supposed to run until 2023. However, in a shock move elected representatives of the SAVM union (Autolib’ Velib’ Métropole) in June called for the plug to be pulled on the service.
The scheme after it emerged that Autolib, which was originally supposed to make a profit of €56 million by 2023, is actually in tens of millions of euros of debt.
The company behind the service, Blue Solutions, blamed the debt on competition from minicabs (VTC) but users also complained of filthy vehicles. In some cases, homeless people were even reported to be sleeping in the cars.

If there is a way to save cost, then a majority of the Indian consumers will try to check it out. That’s been one of the more important ways in which ride sharing apps have been able to grow in a country like India.
The cost benefits to travelling with strangers far outweighs any potential problems arising from trust or theft. The route is typically the same, if you’re commuting to and from work, and the journey burns a lot of petrol.
Now with the price of petrol almost reaching Rs 82 per litre, drivers must be vying for ride-sharing apps in large numbers. Although there are distributed players in the industry, there isn’t any one competitor that’s shining through the cycle.

Unlike Uber and Ola, ride-sharing apps don’t share the same popularity or marketing budgets to reach mass audiences. Right now, their best bet is word of mouth and cost-incentives.
That’s where BlaBlaCar comes in. With it’s ride-sharing community, it has the power to change the way that Indians think about comfortable travelling. Take for example a typical journey from Mumbai to Pune.
The ride will cost you around Rs 350, whether you travel from BlaBlaCar or via an inter-city bus. With the BlaBlaCar, you can request scheduled stops, have pleasant company and be dropped exactly where you need to. There is also a GPS-enabled ride tracking app for increased security and tracking. You have complete control even though you’re riding with a stranger.
More broadly, if we look at the ride-sharing concept from a taxi-aggregator point of view, the cost benefits are immense. With Uber and Ola offering pool-share rides for a few years now, customers are quite accommodating within the crowd of a pull vehicle. With the added incentive of air-conditioning and confirmed rides, there is little incentive for them to coopt other methods.
“We have seen a high uptake for the category on both the customer as well as the driver partner side. Cities such as Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kolkata are the biggest users of Ola Share,” said Vishal Kaul, COO Ola.
A recent Uber and BCG report showed that congestion is going to cost the top four cities in India upwards of $22 billion a year. With more cars being introduced to tier-2 cities as well, that problem is going to mount over time. With the availability of ride-sharing, the propensity to purchase a low to mid-tiered vehicle also goes down.
As is the case with space utilization, there is also a significant trend of reduction in dedicated parking spaces as more people prefer to ride-share.
For these app companies, there is profitability in movement. The more the demand for the apps, the more these cars are constantly moving around. A dead-stop vehicle or one that hasn’t been activated for a long period is a waste to the system.
For Uber and Ola, it’s about 30% of all rides, but the trend continues to go upwards indicating that more Indians want to try these services at an affordable shared-rate.
“With carpooling, Ola and Uber are getting customers who would not otherwise use their services on a daily basis because of the prices. So, the companies are getting access to a set of customers who are cost-conscious, do not use a cab on a daily basis and instead use a bus or an auto rickshaw. Most of these consumers are young professionals.

Over time, they will graduate from using a shared car to booking an entire cab, which makes it a brilliant strategy to onboard new customers, said Sreedhar Prasad, partner, e-commerce and start-ups, KPMG India.
All in all, the demand for these ride-sharing apps is increasing and the country is running on it daily.
When it comes to the smaller players, there’s Ride which is offering a social carpooling experience. They even work with leading companies to take care of their transportation needs as well. For commuters, concepts like these make a lot of sense as they traverse the same route more than five times a week.
“The payment aspect is a one-to-one deal between the driver and the person availing the ride. However, at Rs 3/km, it is as cheap as using a public transport, yet offering the convenience of a car,” said Nitin Chaddha, Business Development Officer of sRide.
There’s also ToGo, Ridely and a host of smaller players that offer a social riding experience. They haven’t yet taken scale, the way that traditional aggregators have and are still trying to find that next big leap.
This could be an indication as to the trust factor for many Indians, who would rather befriend a few colleagues and ride-share individually. However, for travelers going inter-state and for those who aren’t able to travel with others, it’s a great way to save cost and protect the environment.

San Diego has designated additional parking spaces for Zipcar shared vehicles in Little Italy, Mission Hills and downtown under the city’s climate action plan.
Seven new spaces bring the total throughout San Diego to nearly 50 that are for exclusive use by members of the Boston-based car-sharing network, which has a partnership with the city.
Shared transportation has been growing in San Diego, with shared bicycles and electric scooters appearing on many street corners, and shared cars are an option for longer trips and transporting heavy items.
“As we continue the work to achieve the goals in our climate action plan, alternative modes of transportation play a critical role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” said Mayor Kevin Faulconer. “With options like Zipcar, which gives people an affordable option to use a vehicle when they need it and let someone else use it when they don’t, San Diegans have more ways of getting where they need to go.”

The new spaces are located at:

Market Street and Ninth Avenue
600 Eighth Avenue
Kettner Boulevard and West Cedar Street
Fourth Avenue and B Street
Front Street (between Montecito Way and Lewis Street)
Ash Street (between Sixth and Seventh avenues)
Ash Street (between Seventh and Eighth avenues)

According to a UC Berkeley study, each Zipcar takes up to 13 personally owned vehicles off the road. Fewer cars leads to less congestion and fewer carbon emissions, and more space for bike lanes, parks and walking paths.
“We’re excited to expand our car share resources within the city of San Diego, enabling even more people to ditch their personal cars,” said Ashley Cohen, Zipcar’s regional community marketing manager for the West.

The transportation department of the City of Moscow is drafting a bill that would fine private drivers for accepting cash from carpooling passengers and block and/or fine carpool aggregators such as BlaBlaCar, BeepCar, and Yandex.Poputka, Kommersant daily reported on August 21 citing the copy of the bill.
Stringent regulation in the largest city in Russia could slow down the growing carpooling segment. Carsharing, car pooling and online taxi booking is an emerging business in Russia, attracting investment and already subject to fierce competition. The total car sharing and taxi market in 2017-2025 will grow 2.5-fold to RUB1.6 trillion ($24bn) by Sberbank CIB.

Reportedly Moscow authorities plan to introduce special accreditation for carpooling platforms, set a ceiling for ride costs, only allow non-cash transactions, only allow drivers with experience of more than 3 years and without a criminal record or driving fines to register on the platforms, as well as introducing a mandatory medical check-up for drivers that accept over 20 carpooling rides per year.
Industry analysts and lawyers surveyed by Kommersant believe that while filling the regulatory vacuum on the carpooling market is common, too stringent regulations will push the drivers back into the “grey zone” where they arrange the rides independently on internet forums, social media, and messengers.
At the same time in other markets carpooling initiatives are welcomed as means to increase passenger-per-car ratios, combat congestion and pollution. Previously Moscow suffered from chronic traffic jams and the taxi services and carpooling have contributed greatly to reducing the number of cars on the road and subsequently made a big difference to improving traffic conditions.
The market leader in the segment French online car pooling service BlaBlaCar this month said it will acquire its rival in Russia BeepCar owned by internet services major Mail.ru Group.
Russia’s most valuable digital major Yandex also launched a car pooling service, with its pilot Yandex.Poputka app launched in the beginning of 2018 in Krasnoyarsk and Rostov-on-Don, which has had about 10,000 downloads in Google Play.

The two leading ZHAW engineers, Adrian Burri and Hans-Jörg Dennig, founded the spinoff company Share your BICAR AG. During the first round of seed investments, they were able to win over the Swiss investor Urs Horat, the founder of the globally successful Compona AG. Urs Horat noted the following on the occasion of his capital investment: “I believe in electromobility. BICAR is exactly the right solution for short distances, and the fun factor is also extremely high.”
The core product of the spinoff company is the BICAR, a three-wheeled, zero-emissions, and sustainably produced small electric vehicle, which, thanks to its special design and newly developed tilt mechanism, protects the driver from wind and rain and also provides optimum safety even on slippery surfaces. The BICAR is the intermediate step between a bike or  scooter, on the one hand, and a car, on the other. When used as a shared mobility solution, it can offer individual mobility without sacrificing comfort to a wide range of users.
Currently, six engineers and an industrial designer are working closely with the ZHAW School of Engineering to finish development of the vehicle. The market gap for an efficient shared mobility solution is large, which helped the development gain backing from two EU-financed development projects. The aim of both projects is to get the vehicle ready to be released to market so that it meets the requirements for EU registration.
The founders of the spin-off company are also in close contact with various Swiss and European cities. The latter are all looking for space-saving, environmentally friendly mobility solutions that make it possible to reduce private car traffic in city centers and offer the urban population a better quality of life. Numerous Swiss firms and transport companies have already concluded partnerships to offer sharing services.
SYB Investors
The capital requirements for bringing such an innovative development to market are correspondingly high for a start-up company operating in an environment that is dominated by big players. In order to give BICAR further impetus, the founders are open to additional opportunities for raising support for this unique, comfortable, and completely emission-free mobility solution. Additional support is necessary to achieving the next goal of producing an initial run of shared BICAR vehicles to be operated in selected cities in Switzerland and the EU.

Australians in need of personal transport other than taxis have many options – Shofer, Taxify, GoCatch, Shebah and Uber. India’s Ola launched a few months ago, and Chinese DiDi started on Monday (Jun 25).
DiDi is no bit player. The company transports 450 million clients through 25 million rides a day. This is almost five times more than Uber.
DiDi is a company with the size, resources and know-how to challenge Uber’s dominance in ride-sharing and also to generate better, more efficient and equitable outcomes in urban transport more generally.
While competition between platforms is appealing for customers in the short term, it also raises questions about the long-term sustainability of the industry.
Taxis were profitable in the past because governments allowed supply to be limited. But in this new era of competition profitability is threatened and working conditions downgraded.
Currently none of these platforms are turning a profit.
THREATS AND COMPETITION
DiDi expects to turn its first profit in 2018 after losing US$300 million in 2017. But new entrants into the Chinese market are threatening that forecast.

Similarly, Ola plans to be profitable by 2019.
But Uber’s aggressive strategy in India means this is far from guaranteed.
In the meantime, Uber made a A$4.4 million profit in Australia in 2017 while its parent company made a record loss of US$6 billion in 2017.
There are two possible explanations for why Uber Australia turned a profit last year.
First, Australian governments changed regulations and effectively ended the domination of taxi cartels. Second, there wasn’t as much competition in 2017.
All of this will change with the entry of DiDi and Ola. We are likely to see, as has happened in other markets, a contraction of margins for ride-sharing operators.
Australia is just one battleground in the global war for market share being fought by Uber, DiDi and other competitors. While Uber may be considered the leader, it is a contested position. It has been kicked out of some European countries, is in fierce competition with Ola in India, and was bought out in China by none other than DiDi.
Complicating the picture even more is that DiDi, Uber and Ola have a shared institutional investor. DiDi further has a direct stake in Ola, Lyft and Grab.
Where Uber has pursued an aggressive international strategy with little regard for local rules, DiDi has adopted a more cautious, strategic and conciliatory approach. This includes acquiring local ride-sharing services, enticing taxi operators to join the platform and establishing relationships with local tech firms and regulators.
FLEXIBILITY AN IRONY
The ease with which Uber disrupted the Australian taxi market also threatens its profitability. The emergence of several competitors is possible because of the low costs of entry once an app and IT infrastructure are developed.
The consequence of increased competition is that drivers – who are classified as independent contractors – are continually squeezed. The only thing that stopped this dynamic in the taxi industry was state regulation and the emergence of local cartels.
Given the face-to-face nature of the service, there is an irony that the hyper-flexibility may end up hurting the very thing that was the platform’s main attraction – a better customer experience.
Cutting drivers’ pay may be a knee-jerk and flawed short-term response, potentially causing irreparable brand damage and harming consumer experience as drivers lack the resources or desire to look after their customers.
MORE THAN JUST RIDE-SHARING
The platforms’ classifications of their own services suggest that “big data” and more integrated transport solutions may be their real objectives.
DiDi regards itself as “a data company that relies on AI capabilities to advance new mobility solutions and breakthroughs in transportation technology”.
Similarly, Uber described itself as technology firm providing a “smartphone and technological platform” in court proceedings.
Indeed, Uber and DiDi both see integrated and autonomous transport solutions as the path to profitability. In addition to organising and controlling large amounts of valuable data, Uber’s plan is to integrate and streamline all forms of urban transport.

This might involve developing partnerships with governments, already a reality in North America.
Coupled with investment in driverless vehicles, this hints at a very different, and potentially sustainable, future.
DiDi has similar objectives and is already offering integrated transport services in its domestic market, where its app offers a range of services including taxis, buses and bike sharing. DiDi is Uber’s most serious competitor for global supremacy in ride-sharing services in terms of financial backing, war chest, scale of operations and digital capabilities.
While currently the dominant player in the Australian market, over time Uber might become the underdog in these ride share and transport wars.

GOVERNMENTS SHOULD INTERVENE
At the moment, the disruption caused by the platforms has come at a cost.
While increased competition has resulted in lower fares for consumers, it has also placed downward pressure on working conditions. Poor pay and working conditions are not new to this sector, or the wider gig economy. Unless the government steps in, exploitative practices will become ingrained very quickly.
The good news is that if ride-sharing is only a piece in the bigger puzzle of urban transport, state regulation should not be a deterrent to sophisticated players like DiDi and Uber. Additional regulation can ensure better outcomes for ride-share drivers, while they are still required.
In addition, it can also translate into better service for customers in the long term. The platforms’ technologies can help to solve urban transport problems.
So the good news is, if governments step in, this might be a war that customers, workers and the community can still win. However, which platforms will prevail remains to be seen.

What if public agencies don’t change transportation policies or regulations as autonomous vehicles (AVs) enter the market and expand their presence on American roadways? This is one of many questions we investigate in assessing the potential risks that AVs present to the desired future outcomes that cities, regions, and states have established through their land use and transportation plans. We use the term ‘risks’ purposefully. This is because our research and modeling reveal the potential for substantial increases in vehicle travel and decreases in transit ridership if AVs operate under current policy and regulatory frameworks.
So, what can policy makers and local agencies do? We will get to that in the second article of this series but, first it is important to understand how private sector market forces are changing travel decisions and behavior. We follow this exploring a new model of behavior and the results, and then wrap up with some suggestions of what communities can do now to influence these trends.
Changes in Behavior
In an era of disruptive trends and new mobility, travel behavior is changing in ways that directly influence how we model traffic implications. Specifically, these include:
Reduced cost of vehicle travel (in both money and time).
The concept of mobility or transportation as a service (MAAS or TAAS) relies on only paying for the cost of travel when a trip is made.  Sharing trips can further reduce individual traveler costs and is made convenient by app-based technology through smart phones.
Eliminated burden of driving.
Autonomous vehicles (AVs) complement the MAAS model by removing the driver from transportation network company (TNC) services or by allowing private vehicle owners to avoid the driving task.  For TNCs, eliminating the driver lowers the cost of service.  For private individuals, time otherwise spent driving is now available for other purposes.
 
Reduced potential for collisions.
AV technology offers the potential of computer and sensor-aided travel that is designed to avoid collisions. If connected vehicle (CV) technology is also included, vehicle travel can occur with even greater awareness of environmental conditions to minimize the risk of collisions.
 
Vehicle travel made more convenient.
TNCs today provide door-to-door service, eliminate the chore of parking, and offer a variety of vehicle choices and services including wheelchair assistance and Spanish-speaking drivers (see image below).  However, TNC trips are expensive enough that few people that rely on vehicle travel are willing to forgo owning their own vehicles.  The transition to AVs will change the cost equation and vehicle design flexibility may result in even greater vehicle and service choices in addition to providing more travel options for the young, elderly, and those with a range of disabilities.

UBER vehicle choice and service offerings in a suburban market. Source: UBER app accessed April 2018 in Roseville, CA.

These changes create strong possibilities for increased traffic generation, loss of transit ridership, reduced parking needs but increased curb space demands, raising important decision-points for public agencies. To date, public agency action has been limited. Although some municipalities like London have restricted new mobility services, public agencies in the U.S. have largely accommodated disruptive transport. Evidence includes things like 1) the explosive growth of TNCs and 2) the openness to AV testing on public streets. This is happening around the world, in states such as California (where recent laws are focused on reducing vehicle travel and encouraging more active transportation), but also in multimodal havens like the Netherlands.
In light of this, a key policy question is, “What motivates this accommodation?“ This is a central question because, without government action, the private sector business model for TNCs and MAAS generates revenue based on miles of travel, minutes of travel, demand levels, and choice of vehicle/service.  Hence, the private sector is currently incentivized to increase the use of vehicles while the public sector in many cities and states like California has spent the past couple of decades focused on reducing vehicle miles of travel (VMT) to improve sustainability.
To grapple with this dichotomy, between what the market wants and the sustainable and equitable vision that most cities are trying to achieve, we used regional travel forecasting models to test potential future outcomes with and without the influence of new government policies and regulations.
Modeling Disruptive Trends
Disruptive trends extend beyond just the technology changes in transportation. While not a complete list, we identified 16 factors related to trends including, but not limited to, job market health, fuel prices, social networking, vehicle ownership, AVs, and internet shopping. The potential outcome for the future travel associated with these factors is difficult to predict because of the unknown reactions below.

Government regulation of AVs, TNCs, and new modes.
Public transit agency responses to TNCs and AVs.
Public acceptance and use of AVs and sharing them for regular travel.
Public acceptance and use of new modes such as e-bike and e-scooters.

Despite the unknowns, we tested the potential AV effects using traditional regional travel forecasting models. In our case, we tested scenarios using models from seven regions across the US combined with similar test results from two additional regions. All model runs include full market penetration of AVs in the horizon year of the models, which was 2035 or later, and AV-related changes to the following travel forecasting model variables related to travel behavior.

Terminal Time – Travel models define the time needed to park your car and walk to a destination as “terminal time.” The higher a terminal time, the less likely a person will choose an auto for a particular trip. AVs are likely to reduce terminal times by eliminating the need to park and providing on-demand door-to-door service.
Parking Cost – Most models include a variable for parking cost in areas where costs are imposed. AVs have the potential to lower or even eliminate these traditional parking costs.
Value of Time – Travel models also incorporate the value of time, but in different ways. Travelers using AVs will have lower values of time because the opportunity cost of driving will be reduced.
Auto Availability – Models generally have variables tied to trip rates and auto availability.  AVs may increase trip rates due to their greater convenience and ready availability. Greater convenience could lead to more discretionary vehicle trips for shopping, social, leisure or recreational purposes.  Additionally, people not licensed to drive will be able to make vehicle trips.
Roadway Capacity – As vehicles become more automated and connected, they offer greater potential to increase roadway capacity especially on freeways.  The increase in capacity will come from shorter headways, less weaving, and more stable traffic flows. Roadway capacity will increase first on freeways and expressways, then on major arterials.
Auto Operating Costs – Vehicle travel has costs associated with purchasing or leasing, operating, and maintaining the vehicle. Travel decisions tend to focus on the operating costs such as fueling the vehicle and can be expressed in a model as a per mile cost to capture higher costs for longer distance trips. For AVs, operating costs are expected to be lower due to electrification of vehicles and potential for vehicle sharing.
Auto Occupancy – Auto occupancy is the number of persons per vehicle and it has a substantial effect on the number of vehicle trips and related effects on how the roadway network operates.  We test traditional levels of auto occupancy and a scenario with higher levels of shared trips (i.e., carpooling).

The general expectation from testing AV effects was that vehicle travel would likely to increase and transit ridership would decrease for the main reasons cited at the beginning of this article.

AVs will reduce the cost of vehicle travel (in both money and time).
AVs eliminate the task of driving.
AVs will reduce the potential for collisions.
AVs will make vehicle travel more convenient.

This week, New York City legislated to require a minimum pay rate for ride-share drivers  — the result of a two-year campaign by the Independent Drivers Guild.
This massive mobilisation of drivers in New York could foreshadow what’s to come in Australia, which, for now, is one of the only profitable markets for Uber.
An estimated 15,000 Australian Uber drivers disconnected from Uber on Monday to protest against company policies, including low commissions.
The New York City Council voted for a package of bills aiming “to regulate the for-hire vehicle industry”. It creates a new licence for “high-volume for-hire service”  — that’s companies serving over 10,000 trips a day.

This licence is accompanied by new regulatory powers given to the Taxi and Limousine Commission, including a one-year moratorium on new licences. This is a significant development in an already crowded market, and a first step in addressing concerns about traffic congestion and driver waiting times.
Most significantly, the commission will set minimum payments for drivers operating under the new high-volume licence, and potentially implement minimum payments for existing licences.
Technically, this is not minimum wage legislation. However, the introduction of regulation of the number of vehicles and of a minimum payment is a significant shift.
It could end the current race to the bottom.
At the moment, ride-share companies are competing with each other by saturating the market. They are hiring as many new drivers as they can, reducing the commission they pay to drivers and mechanically limiting the “surge” price periods when rides are more expensive because of high demand.
With fewer drivers on the road and a minimum price, drivers might actually be able to start making a decent living. It might also lead to a shift to competition on quality of service rather than quantity and price, benefiting the customer.
But the end of the race to the bottom doesn’t necessarily mean ride-sharing companies will disappear. They might just have to reconsider their business models and accept they need to provide sustainable services.
People power
The Independent Drivers Guild was created in May 2016 following negotiations with Uber and represents the 65,000 New York City drivers.
The guild’s advocacy activities include, among other things, petitions (16,000 signatures on the most recent one), phone and email campaigns, and demonstrations, including a funeral caravan aimed at scuttling an initial bill before the city council that would have imposed fees on individual ride-share drivers.
The guild also successfully lobbied the Taxi and Limousine Commission to require Uber to add a tipping option to its app. This option was later implemented across the United States.
The New York legislation shows mobilisation in the gig world is possible  — it serves as a strong encouragement for the growing Ride Share Drivers United, one of the Australian equivalents of the New York Guild.
 

Ride Share Drivers United’s “No Uber Monday!” led to a 1,200-person strike in April 2017 and 15,000 drivers logging off on Monday.
This triggered a prompt reaction from the Fair Work Ombudsman, who informed Ride Share Drivers United of progress in the current investigation of pricing and the introduction of UberPool  — a recently introduced service where riders share a car.
The recent strike was supported by the main competitors Ola and Didi, which provided incentives to drivers to log onto their apps during the strike. Ola and Didi have not applied the same controversial upfront pricing policy as Uber, meaning competitors are starting to perceive that the business model needs to be more sustainable.
The New York City legislation is a tangible move away from acceptance of a ‘free market’ approach to digital platforms  — that holds that if there is a market for a service it should be allowed at any cost  — to a demand for fairness. That means if a market does not provide for socially acceptable outcomes, it should not be allowed or should be regulated to moderate its excesses.
This could be the start of a new era where regulation of the gig economy allows for the right balance between flexibility and sustainability.

It used to be that the world had to adapt to Uber. Now Uber is having to adapt to the world it helped create.
In the four years since the rideshare company started operating in Australia and created a whole new market, its success is also becoming its risk.
States have broken up and deregulated the taxi industry and, from the NSW to the Northern Territory, have legalised and sought to regulate ridesharing.
The red tape differs state by state – Queensland drivers complain they must pay $1000 in fees before they can become a rideshare driver – but experts agree that overall the regulation has been minimalist.


The company views Australia as its most successful market for UberEats, its on-demand delivery service for restaurants. Bloomberg


Uber has successfully shaped the country to its needs. But there are now also very few barriers to entry in the point-to-point transport market.


UTS Business School associate professor Sarah Kaine says one of the key features of Uber’s success and its potential downfall is that it has opened the market.
“It has legitimised its own method of entering and creating markets but it has now paved the way for other organisations, who didn’t have to go through all the regulatory hassle, to come in and share the market.”
Uber’s early lead and “winner takes most” mentality mean it is still the dominant player but it is now facing some very powerful competitors.
In Australia, competitors with pockets as deep, if not deeper, than Uber’s have started muscling in on its territory and future plans.

European rival Taxify launched in Sydney at the end of last year and Indian giant Olachose Australia as its first foreign market.

Last week, Chinese rideshare giant Didi Chuxing, which transports 450 million clients through 25 million rides a day, entered Australia.
All are hugely influential, with Didi, Ola and Uber even sharing the same institutional investor. But its rivals appear to have a quicker route to profit than Uber.
While Uber secured a small $4 million profit in Australia last year, it was on the back of $6 billion in losses internationally. Didi, on the other hand, while also operating on massive losses, is predicting it will turn a profit internationally this year.
 

UberEats most popular in Australia

Perhaps cognisant of the tighter market, Uber is increasingly branching out of rideshare services and achieving some success.


The company views Australia as its most successful market for UberEats, its on-demand delivery service for restaurants.
The profits from this could be huge. A UBS report last month predicted online takeaway portals like UberEats could be a $365 billion industry by 2030, predicting time-starved and asset-light consumers would replace most home-cooked meals with online orders.

However, with the additional stakeholder of the restaurant, there has also been emerging concerns that the service isn’t working as well as businesses hoped.

Melbourne chef Shane Delia was last year inspired by UberEats to open a series of “dark kitchens”, kitchens that cook food purely for delivery, to service inner and outer suburbs for his kebab brand Biggie Smalls.
But he told AFR Weekend he was forced to close down all seven six months later, blaming UberEats and other platforms’ “quite aggressive” commission levels.
As for transport, Uber’s long-term focus is on a completely integrated model, not just rideshare but also bicycle, buses and boats.

The company is working with cities to become part of an urban transport solution. In NSW and Victoria, that means talking to governments over a pilot program for buses, which would make use of pooling services in uberPOOL to develop an on-demand public transport system.


Since 2016, Uber has partnered with Transport Canberra to extend the reach of its late-night bus services during Christmas and major events by discounting Uber rides to or from selected bus stops to surrounding suburbs.
The problem is Didi has similar ambitions. It even wants to develop autonomous transport solutions.
“Didi is really going to give Uber a run for their money,” Kaine says. “It’s going to be a bit of a battle of technology. Another race to dominate that market first.”
Uber success over ’employee status’
Lurking beneath all this, but not yet forgotten, is the question of whether Uber drivers are in fact independent contractors or employees, which could see Uber on the hook for millions of dollars in minimum wages and conditions.
In Australia, Uber has had more legal success
than overseas, where landmark rulings in the United Kingdom and United States have held the company was an employer of its drivers.
While local drivers have so far not had the benefit of legal representation, the Fair Work Commission has twice found in favour of Uber and there is still no major test case on the horizon.

But the question is far from resolved and even the commission, in a decision last year, expressed uncertainty over whether Fair Work rules were suited to the gig economy.

“It may be that these notions are outmoded in some senses and are no longer reflective of our current economic circumstances,” deputy president Val Gostencnik says.
The perception that riders do not have a fair deal due to their lack of negotiating power will persist, Kaine says, and would likely usher in changes to the law.
“The trend all around the world in a variety of jurisdictions is opting for some way to assist better conditions for drivers, particularly around the US. In New York they’re talking about a minimum wage, and others states are talking about portable entitlement schemes.”
The plight of drivers will only likely get worse as more competition sees more drivers for fewer rides.
In the end, for all the competition, Uber still has the dominant brand recognition. Yet as rideshare driver Les Johnson says, that may not count for as much as one thinks.
“Many years ago, Hoover created the vacuum cleaner and even today people say they’re going to ‘hoover’ the house,” he says.
“But if you walk into any retail outlet you’ll be lucky to see a Hoover vacuum cleaner, you’ll instead see a myriad of other brands. I’ve often wondered if that’s what will happen to Uber in Australia.”

No one could argue that Car2go CEO Olivier Reppert didn’t have some skin in the game during the Chicago launch of the point-to-point car-sharing service this morning in Pioneer Court.
He stood motionless in the downtown plaza in front of one of the company’s pint-sized Smart cars while young people from the Jesse White Tumblers gymnastics crew bounced off a trampoline, soared through the air Superman-style, and somersaulted over the vehicle and his head.

After surviving the stunt apparently concussion-free, Reppert addressed the crowd, noting that the location was an appropriate setting for “pioneering” the technology in Chicago.
Point-to-point allows members to check out a vehicle and end their trip at any legal curbside parking space, which makes it handy for errands and traveling the first or last mile to or from a transit station. While it has existed in peer U.S. cities for several years, Chicago’s much-hated parking meter contract complicated the process of bringing the technology to town.
A backlash from local car owners and their aldermen who feared that the service would gobble up parking spaces for private vehicles also put a crimp in the plans to test Car2go in Chicago. While the original ordinance for the eight-month pilot, introduced by near-northwest side alderman Joe Moreno, outlined a service area stretching from Foster to 63rd, several aldermen opted out of the pilot.
As a result, the “Home Zone” goes no further south than Cermak, excluding virtually the entire south side, and there’s a major crater in the coverage area on the near-north side, since Lakeview and Lincoln Park aldermen Tom Tunney and Michele Smith refused to participate.
Burnett noted that the Car2go pilot is creating jobs, and it should have a positive effect on traffic congestion and air quality. He added that, since the company is owned by Daimler-Chrysler, Car2go members will be also be able to rent snazzy Mercedes sedans and SUVs in addition to the minimalists Smart Cars.Still, at the ribbon cutting, near-west alderman Walter Burnett, chair of the city’s pedestrian and traffic safety committee, told the audience he’s jazzed about the new service.
Alderman Brian Hopkins, whose ward includes parts of the near-north and northwest sides, noted that while the pilot is an experiment, so was America’s postwar effort to switch to a transportation system with near-universal universal private car ownership. “It didn’t work, and I think we can now declare that that experiment was a failure,” he said.
Hopkins added that contrary to fears about Car2go creating a parking crunch, a 2016 UC Berkeley study of some 10,000 Car2go members found that each shared car took up to 11 private vehicles off the road.
Afterwards Burnett told me that he feels the elimination of the heavily African-American south side from the Car2go pilot was inequitable, but he’s optimistic that after the pilot proves successful, his south side colleagues will be interested in bringing the cars to their wards.
Likewise, Hopkins said that while the limited service area makes the service less useful, he thinks that fears about parking will subside after Chicagoans better understand how the technology works.
Car2go business development manager Mike DeBonville, who’s overseeing the Chicago launch, conceded that the heavily gerrymandered Home Zone will make the cars less convenient to use.
“What makes for a successful location is really having a contiguous, open, home area where people can begin and end their trips anywhere,” he said. “When you have holes, it really adds to the complexity and doesn’t make it as convenient as it could be.”
Car2go will be deploying 400 vehicles during the Chicago pilot, including roughly 200 Smart cars, 120 sedans, and 80 SUVs. About 150 cars are currently on the streets. The Smart cars rent for 29 cents a minute, $7 for a half hour, and $15 an hour, while the Mercedes vehicles cost 39 cents a minute, $10 for a half hour, and $19 an hour.
Chicagoans can register for free by using the code CHI2018. Resident who register though August 23 will also receive $15 in car2go credit. After that date there’s a one-time $5 sign up cost, in addition to  the usage fees.

As the summer season winds down in the Roaring Fork Valley, the executive director of the country’s first free bike-sharing system is taking stock in the success of the program.
WE-cycle ridership has grown significantly over past year — from 2,786 users to just over 5,000 riders. And those bicyclists took more than 50,000 rides this season, according to WE-cycle Executive Director Mirte Mallory.
This is the first year that the bike-sharing program is free. Riders can take a bike from any of the 47 stations located in Aspen or Basalt for 30 minutes for free. Every additional minute is $.50 cents.
One of the biggest trends that emerged this year is that people used the bikes as part of their daily commute to work.

In Basalt, there was a surge in the number of people who took the bikes stationed in neighborhoods and rode them to park-and-ride lots in the morning and then back home in the evening, Mallory said.
“(Our goal is to) pre-empt the car trip at the beginning and provide that hub and spoke solution,” she said.

The average time a rider used a bike in Aspen was 10 minutes and eight in Basalt.

“People are riding more frequently but riding less,” Mallory said, adding 97 percent of riders used the bikes for under 30 minutes this season.
She noted that there was a spike in ridership during the lunch hour in Aspen, with users taking bikes to restaurants and doing errands.
Top riders have already ridden 300 times this season and are using WE-cycle two or three times every day.
Cristal Logan, vice president and director of Aspen Community Programs at the Aspen Institute, relies on WE-cycle when she commutes from her home in Basalt to her office. She also uses it to do errands in town.
“When I do use the bus I love WE-cycle to get to the Paepcke building (on the Institute campus),” she said. “I would say WE-cycle is critical to getting to our buildings.”
Logan added that the Institute has encouraged its visitors and scholars to use the bike-sharing program to get around town.
“It’s amazing to see how much we can influence people who don’t live here,” she said.
Mallory said the nonprofit had to respond quickly to the growth in ridership. She added staff to “balance” the number of bikes at each station every day.
She estimated that the balancers moved about 100 bikes a day to ensure there were enough docked at all the locations.
Another trend that emerged was riders didn’t necessarily want to do the heavy lifting by taking them to a station that involved going uphill.
To combat that, WE-cycle rolled out “rider challenges” so that if a user took five bikes back to a particular location they would receive a free cookie and espresso at Paradise Bakery.
A new challenge has been launched in conjunction with Adidas TERREX. It challenges riders to bike to uphill locations, and encourages usage in different ways. At the end of the season, winners will be awarded with clothing provided by the athletic company.
WE-cycle also has introduced on its website a valley-wide station planning map in which users can suggest specific locations, or support a suggestion.

“We are eager to hear where bike share can serve you,” Mallory said. “We’ll use it as a planning tool for regional bike sharing.”
If voters approve a 2.65 mill levy in all eight jurisdictions in the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority’s service area this fall, it will fund WE-cycle in Carbondale and Glenwood Springs in the coming years.
WE-cycle is one of the feeder services included in RFTA’s 20-year plan and is a central part of helping people use alternative transportation, Mallory said.
She noted that 47 percent of ridership last year replaced car trips.
WE-cycle is partly funded by local governments, so securing multi-year commitments has allowed Mallory to offer the service for free.
The Elected Officials Transportation Committee, which is comprised of the city, Pitkin County and Snowmass Village, committed $100,000 this year and in 2019. The Roaring Fork Transportation Authority also is kicking in $100,000 annually for three years. The city of Aspen upped its contribution to $145,000 this year, and the town of Basalt and Eagle County each contributed $45,000.
Mallory said this summer’s usage reiterates the notion that when bike sharing is free, simple and easy, people will use it.
“It’s important for valley-wide connectivity,” she said.

Although global sales of plug-in vehicles are forecast to comprise only about 2% of global new car sales for the year 2018, and EVs make up only 0.2% of all light-duty passenger vehicles on the world’s roads today, the market continues to grow and major carmakers are increasingly committing assets and production capacity to the manufacture of EVs.
For example, Porsche has set a goal of making half of its cars electric by 2023, while General Motors, Toyota and Volvo have all set a target of one million EV sales by 2025 and BMW announced that it will offer no fewer than 12 fully electric models by that same year. Clearly, these and other car manufacturers with similarly ambitious EV plans are expecting a growth in global demand, which has so far been stifled by several factors, including cost, an immature charging infrastructure and, perhaps most important, a lack of consumer familiarity with driving an EV.
At the same time, car-sharing is also making inroads in the mobility ecosystem. For instance, Daimler’s car-sharing subsidiary car2go announced that it surpassed the watershed of three million members globally in January, while reporting a 30% increase in its membership for the year 2017. In a statement, car2go CEO Oliver Reppert said: “Studies project that the number of people who car-share will increase fivefold over the next few years.”
Carmakers and other car-sharing providers are now increasingly adding EVs to their fleets as cities, particularly in Europe are increasingly limiting access to their centers. In a move that may portend the future of car-sharing, Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing is establishing an EV car-sharing service with 12 automakers, including local partners of Ford and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, Reuters reported. Mobility providers are apparently beginning to see the advantages to combining the two mobility options.
According to a report by the German national association of car-sharing providers, the Bundesverband Car-Sharing e. V. (BCS), EVs and car-sharing are a perfect fit, with potential synergies that could help both mobility segments grow. “The opportunity to use sustainable energy to propel electric vehicles goes well with the ecological requirements of the classic car-sharing offer,” the BCS writes in a position paper. “The disadvantages of electric vehicles with regard to range and vehicle size are not relevant for car-sharing.”
The BCS goes on to say that “electric vehicles in the car-sharing fleets are helping to further cement car-sharing’s green image and, conversely, increase its public visibility.” This works both ways, according to the BCS, which notes: “Electric vehicles are currently too expensive for many households to purchase as privately used cars … Electric cars in the car-sharing fleets can thus tap new customer segments through car-sharing, segments which previously saw no need there.”
One company that has taken full advantage of this synergy is the Paris-based Blue Solutions, a subsidiary of the Bolloré Group. Serge Amabile, the executive sales director for Blue Solutions, believes this mobility partnership is a win-win opportunity. “Because of increasing congestion in big cities, car-sharing is a trend that every city will have to implement, in order to reduce car ownership and the number of cars on the road,” he says. “Sharing cars is a must-do and because of pollution, car-sharing will have to go electric as well. We are hoping that car-sharing will familiarize consumers with EVs.”
Blue Solutions produces EVs exclusively for its own car-sharing service. Amabile says it also produces charge points, constructs the entire charging infrastructure and provides the IT systems. “We can do everything from A to Z to set up and run a 100-percent-electric car-sharing system. And we produce the batteries as well.” In fact, the sale of the batteries is the focal point of the company’s business model. “The purpose of the company called Blue Solutions, which is listed on the Paris stock exchange, is to produce lithium metal polymer (LMP) batteries,” he explains. “We want to show the world that this battery is safer, and more robust, solid and reliable than any other lithium ion batteries. We put these batteries in all our vehicles – cars and electric buses. This is why we went into car-sharing, because at the very beginning we had the battery and we wanted to show everyone that this battery can be used in cars and buses.”
The company’s LMP battery and power train are currently powering the Citroën electrical off-road compact SUV E-Méhari. In addition, Blue Solutions currently has more than 6,000 EVs in eight car-sharing schemes around the globe –  in Paris, Lyon and Bordeaux in France, Turin in Italy, London, Los Angeles, Indianapolis and Singapore. It also has some 6,200 charging points in and around Paris and it provides its car-sharing charging infrastructure, via a subscription fee, to owners of all EVs, easing the way for major carmakers to market their electric passenger cars.
“This is why when BMW launched its i3, the very first billboard campaign in Paris read ‘BMW is connected to Autolib’ [the city’s Blue Solutions car-sharing service],” Amabile says. “This is very important for all manufacturers of EVs, because they can tell their customers that if they are not sure of the range, they have more than 6,000 charge points around the Ile de France. This is important because it is one of the things people worry about when buying an EV.”
Blue Solutions believes that its future success is tied to the growing popularity of electric car-sharing. As Amabile puts it, “The more popular e-mobility gets, the more batteries we will sell. Car-sharing is a means for us to demonstrate the reliability and the safety of the battery, and this is very important for us.”

Shared mobility have experienced success in cities that have a really good transit background already…
All of these modes team up to enable people to live car-free or car-light lifestyles.
But now mid-sized cities, smaller communities and even rural areas are exploring theese solutions.
For the nearly 4.2 million rural households in the United States that don’t own a car, options for getting around can be limited: Public transit is almost nonexistent, and cab rides are too costly for day-to-day needs.
As for possible solutions, the CS Monitor mention the Finnish app called “Whim” that is still in beta links all bus, train, bike, taxi, and ride share programs so car-free users can buy a complete mobility package in one place to ensure smooth transitions for their trip.

Future Structure explores another possibility: “One strategy that has been used by the Denver Housing Authority and Boulder Housing Partners has been to build carsharing stations around public housing complexes.
By placing the vehicles in easy-to-access locations for lower-income residents, the programs should be viable option for trips to hospital appointments, grocery shopping or job interviews.

Winnipeg: Uber drivers will pay a quarter of what taxi drivers do for insurance, according to rates proposed by Manitoba Public Insurance.
MPI has set proposed rates for ride sharing drivers, who work for companies like Uber and Lyft, at about $2,500 annually for drivers operating at all times of the day, every day of the week.
“They’re insured just like a normal driver, except if they want to do ride-sharing services, then they pay a premium over top of what they normally pay,” said Ward Keith, vice-president of business development and communications for MPI, adding that the additional premium is 20 per cent.
Keith said taxicab drivers pay around $10,000 per year.
Under the new rate scheme, taxi drivers who choose to only work in select time categories will be eligible to pay less than the full cost, as will ride-sharing drivers.
Keith says rates for ride-sharing drivers could change in the future, because MPI will track the claims experience of those drivers in a separate pool from other drivers.

“The objective here is to make sure that regular drivers are not subsidizing the insurance rates for ride-share operators, just like they’re not subsidizing the rates for taxi operators today,” said Keith.
The proposed rates are subject to approval by the Public Utilities Board.
If approved, they will come into effect March 1, 2018.

General Motors not only is back at the forefront of the auto industry, the auto giant is running neck and neck with Waymo as the perceived leader in self-driving car technology.
Its self-driving vehicle unit, GM Cruise, is  in a battle with Waymo, a subsidiary of Google, to be first to bring fully autonomous cars to market. The two companies are considered the leaders in a crowded field, and San Francisco is the proving grounds to refine the technology.









In San Francisco, GM is testing its own ride-sharing app using its fleet of self-driving cars and a dispatch operation that works similarly to an air traffic control center. Self-driving technology is moving at lightning speed, with GM betting that autonomous vehicles (AVs) will be an important part of its business one day as people’s transportation needs and preferences change.
Here’s how GM got to the front and where it plans to go.
The testing grounds
GM bought Cruise in 2016 as a 40-person startup. Today, it employs 740 people, says  Patrick Sullivan, a GM Cruise spokesman, and it’s valued at more than 10 times what GM paid for it. GM paid about $1 billion for Cruise, and today it’s valued at more than $11 billion, according to TheStreet.com.
Adding to its value is the fact that SoftBank, a leading technology investor with stakes in such companies as Uber, will put $2.25 billion into GM Cruise Holdings, with GM investing $1.1 billion as part of the partnership.


The first Cruise self-driving cars were Chevrolet Bolts, all-electric vehicles that used two Lidar sensors on the roof. They came out the same year GM bought Cruise.



Last year, GM Cruise built 130 of the second generation of its AVs with  a bigger suite of sensors, Sullivan said. Then, last fall, it added another 50 of the cars. GM no longer calls them Bolts, but rather the Cruise AV, he said.
All the self-driving cars are electric and still have operating controls, such as a steering wheel and brakes. They are being tested mostly in San Francisco, with a handful deployed in Milford, Michigan, and the Phoenix area, Sullivan said.
“They have been mapping vehicles for New York City,” said Sam Abuelsamid, senior analyst at Navigant Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. “It’s now up to New York state as to when they will decide to give out driverless permits. They have not given it yet to any company.”
GM’s hushed start
GM has also quietly developed its own ride-sharing app called Cruise Anywhere and has been testing it with its employees in San Francisco for about a year.
Coinciding with the testing of the app, GM Cruise is also testing a dispatch platform in San Francisco, Abuelsamid said. He visited GM Cruise’s headquarters there last November, rode in an AV and saw the app.
The dispatch platform is a command center of sorts. People track the self-driving cars in real time, monitor each AV’s battery charge level and know if the cars are occupied or not. Dispatchers will be able to take control of the cars remotely in emergencies, Abuelsamid said.

GM Cruise declined to provide an executive to discuss the testing, but representatives did confirm it is testing the ride-hailing app in San Francisco.
Also, GM leaders will not comment on which city GM will initially deploy fully autonomous cars, but most experts expect it will be San Francisco in early spring.
GM Cruise’s fleet of 180 all-electric AVs travel the hilly San Francisco streets now dozens of times a day, acting as a taxi-like service for employees only.
GM has also installed 18 fast chargers for the electric vehicles in a parking garage near the city’s busy Embarcadero eastern waterfront, sources say.






Like all AVs in the U.S., the Cruise AVs must have a human on board for safety for now. But, observers say, its learning has made it a front-runner among competitors such as Waymo, Uber, Ford, Tesla and others to deliver on its promise to launch self-driving cars through a ride-sharing platform in 2019.
“GM and Waymo overall are the leaders,” said Abuelsamid, who publishes an annual Automated Driver Leader Board study. “GM’s technology is as good as Waymo’s, and they have the capability to develop and service those vehicles. They’re in good shape.”
Pretty normal
So far, self-driving cars have mastered navigating safely around pedestrians and other cars, but they struggle to read bicyclists.
Stacey Randecker Bartlett, an avid bicyclist, sees GM Cruise AVs “multiple times” daily around San Francisco. Bartlett, a senior marketing manager for auto supplier Renesas Electronics America, works on “advanced automotive” and has an interest in autonomous cars.
She said GM Cruise, Uber, Waymo and Zoox are all testing AVs in San Francisco, but the Cruise AVs are by far the most commonly seen. Most have two to four people in them and run at all hours, she said.
“I don’t know if they’re going around just for miles or they’re taking people places,” Bartlett said.
Abuelsamid has been to San Francisco recently and said, “It’s increasingly not unusual to see autonomous vehicles running around. It’s getting to be a pretty normal thing.”
How it works
In GM’s 2018 Self-driving Safety Report on autonomous vehicles, it describes how it would commercialize the AVs through a ride-sharing platform.
“Customers will use a mobile app to request a ride, just like they use ride-sharing today. The only difference is that customers will control the experience – their customized climate control and radio station settings will be sent to the vehicle ahead of when they access their ride,” the report said.
GM Cruise’s fleet operations will send an AV to a customer’s location and drive them to their destination, the report said. It went on to say once a customer is inside the car, there are “touch-screen tablets to access real-time status information about the ride.
The tablets will also remind passengers to close all doors and fasten their seat belts. Passengers will be able to communicate with remote support personnel with the press of a button. There’s another button for passengers to press if they want to end a ride because of an emergency.”
Cruise will have human support staff to initiate contact with passengers when assistance is needed. The report said, “Once the ride is over, if passengers forget to close the doors, the vehicle can close them itself and move on to the next customer.”

SO YOU just got laid off and you need to keep things going, and you need a steady source of income that could keep you afloat in the longer run.
One of the simplest solutions is to join one of the many ride-sharing outfits as a driver. Chances are, if you work hard enough, you might be making more than what you previously earned.
Even if you do not have your own car, you can opt to “rent and drive” any of the models offered by the ride-sharing company of your choice.
All you need is a driving licence and you’re good to go.
You might not think that this was possible a few years ago. When the ride-sharing concept was first introduced in Malaysia, many also thought that it was just a fad that might go as fast as it came.

The government’s decision to legalise the revolutionary system a couple of years ago was certainly a real game changer.
Even before the business became legit, ride-sharing companies were already expanding their operations with packages and promotions to woo more customers.
When the amendments to the Land Public Transport Act 2010 and Commercial Vehicles Licensing Board Act 1987 were officially passed in August last year, leading ridesharing companies became even more aggressive, with more new players entering the market.
With e-hailing laws scheduled to be gazetted this year, industry players are projected to find equal amounts of success (and failures) in the soon-to-be regulated operating environment.
Grab
Since its humble beginning as a taxi-based e-hailing app in Malaysia back in 2012, Grab has grown to be the market leader not only in the country, but in South-East Asia as well.
The course taken by the ride-sharing company has been one of expansion, operating in 168 cities across eight Asean countries, boasting over 2.3 million drivers and commanding 95% of third-party taxi-hailing apps today.
Based out of Singapore, the company is now entering the e-money game via its e-wallet service, Grab-
Pay, having already received central bank approval to launch the online payment platform in Malaysia and begun commercial operations in Singapore.
The e-wallet presently facilitates over 3.5 million transactions daily and a billion transactions annually.
With a strong financial backing which saw the company securing approximately US$4.63 billion (RM18.52 billion) in investments since May 2014, Grab has been striving on the principles of a sharing economy to become a leading tech player in the region.
With reports that the leading e-hailing provider for the region is looking to buy a stake in Uber’s South-East Asian business, Grab appears to be sealing its dominance in the market by taking over its biggest competitor.
Uber
Kick-starter ride-sharing company Uber Technologies Inc has a strong foothold in Malaysia’s e-hailing market with operations spanning 15 cities across the country.


Uber has a strong foothold in Malaysia’s e-hailing market with operations spanning 15 cities across the country

It might be dwarfed by Grab’s 28 cities of operation, but the San Francisco- headquartered e-hailing player still provides a competitive ridesharing alternative in Malaysia as users often alternate between the two companies based on price-point and availability.
Uber was further responsible for making the concept of securing a ride with the touch of a button, an idea born in the snowy Parisian streets back in 2008, into an everyday reality for the world.
The company has weathered its own storms since its inception in 2009. Recently, its internal issues at the key management level grabbed media’s attention while dealing with increasingly stringent regulations internationally.
Despite Malaysia giving the green light to e-hailing, the fate of Uber in the country is unclear ahead of reports that the company is looking to divest out of its South-East Asian operations.
Details are sketchy at the moment with, neither Grab nor Uber, willing to comment on the speculation.
The deal presents an opportunity for the latter to unlock some cash as it seeks to recover to profitability.
Riding Pink
The first of its kind in Malaysia, Riding Pink is a ride-sharing platform for and by women, aimed at providing female drivers an alternative source of income and a reliable, same-gender passengers, safe public transport.
Founder Denise Tan conceived the idea when she realised how difficult it was to re-join the workforce after becoming a stay-at-home mother to support her family.
Having observed that there were no ride-sharing services exclusive to women in the country, especially in light of growing safety concerns, Tan and her husband began commercial operations for the service in October 2016, charging a RM1 base rate and RM1 for pre-booking.
The platform measured over 100 drivers early this year and is still very much in its infancy with no mobile-based app to its name. Bookings can be made on the company’s Facebook page, or via WhatsApp.
Operating as a women-exclusive ride-sharing service, Riding Pink could carve a niche within the rapidly growing e-hailing industry by catering to a presently underserved  market.
PICKnGO
The rapid rise of e-hailing services in Malaysia left the fate of taxi drivers in the balance as they struggled to break even amid the competitive environment.
Pick N Go Sdn Bhd — the taxibased e-hailing app servicing the Greater Kuala Lumpur area — aims to provide a lifeline to the increasingly disenfranchised taxi community by providing a cost-competitive alternative to mainstay e-hailing providers Grab and Uber.
The mobile-app utilises metered rates over surge pricing, the latter of which can result in Grab and Uber rates to be as much as three times higher than average.
Bringing in only registered and licensed taxi drivers, the company is looking to secure 10,000 drivers on the platform within a year from its official launch on Aug 7 last year.
Having secured approximately 5,000 mobile-app downloads to date, PICKnGO is a joint venture between five taxi companies that is striving to provide convenient, consistent and competitive taxi services in an industry measuring some 180,000 drivers nationwide.

Dacsee
In an increasingly saturated operating environment, finding a niche becomes not only a novel, but needed approach in gaining a foothold in the market.
Decentralised Alternative Cabs Serving and Empowering Everyone (Dacsee) is doing just that by using blockchain technology to provide ride-sharing users transparency, and drivers greater control over their earnings.
Akin to the multi-tier marketing model, drivers on the Dacsee platform are allowed to form their own fleets to derive and earn their own commission, while the company itself will only charge 1% to 2% from the drivers’ earning.
This is significantly lower than the 20% to 25% commission rates collected from Grab and Uber. All transactions on the decentralised platform will use Ethereum ERC20 tokens to ensure transparency for both drivers and users.
Dacsee is aiming to secure a customer network of 50,000 people when it launches operations in April this year, paving the way for innovative solutions in a tech-driven industry.
MULA Car
E-hailing services have played a pivotal role in ensuring last-mile connectivity for commuters as journeys to and from work begin and end in a car.
Mula Car International Sdn Bhd is providing this connectivity in style by offering users their pick of premium and luxury multi-purpose vehicles and compact cars for their journeys.
The mobile-based e-hailing app has a fleet of 250 cars providing transportation and logistics services in its home base of Penang, while having grown its business by 20% every month since launching in May last year.
The growth has encouraged the company to expand its fleet to 750 cars with an expansion plan that would cover Johor, Melaka, Seremban (Negri Sembilan) and Ipoh (Perak) before the end of the year.
By 2019, the company is anticipated to offer as high as 2,000 MULA cars operating in Malaysia.
Going to and from work in luxury could soon be a reality for Malaysian commuters.

Thanks to the hard work of Hawaii’s elected officials and civic leaders, Honolulu is on track to realizing a high-capacity, mass transit system — one that has been planned for decades and will be an important part of Honolulu’s future. Even with 120,000 passengers shuttling back and forth across Oahu on the rail system by 2030, there will still be plenty of cars on the road.
Rail is critical to, but only part of, the mobility and transportation future for Hawaii. That future will also include electric and driverless cars on our streets and highways. With the advent of app-based ride-sharing services and even autonomous shuttles, this future is also trending to a significant reduction in car ownership.
Some people have suggested that such technological innovations, however, will make our rail system irrelevant or obsolete. In such a transportation future, however, our city’s driverless, electric trains will be even more important and more relevant than ever.


The rail guideway along Kamehameha Highway near the Aloha Stadium with a Waikiki Trolley in the foreground. Rail is just one part of Honolulu’s multi-modal transportation future.

Complementing Public Transportation
Under the emerging shared mobility ecosystem, people will be able to choose from a variety of transportation systems that best meet their needs. For many trips, the combination of walking or biking and public transit will often be the most economical, reliable and comfortable transportation option.
Much of Honolulu’s population already lives and works within a narrow urban corridor sandwiched between the mountains and the ocean. This is where we are building the rail line, and most people will be able to get to a rail station simply by walking, biking or taking a short bus ride.
As rail stations come online and become the major hubs in each community, travel patterns will shift accordingly. By focusing public transit and even shared-ride services at these stations, communities will be able to support more frequent service — making it more competitive to the personal automobile.
On-demand ride-sharing services and autonomous vehicles will be able to provide mobility options that will complement traditional public transit routes. Several companies are developing small, driverless shuttles that can carry up to a couple of dozen people over short distances.
In the future, such technologies could provide convenient services to and from the rail stations, especially during off-peak hours when demand is lower. These “first-mile, last-mile” services will work together with rail to increase mobility options and improve overall public transit service.
Indeed, a recent study by the American Public Transit Association has found that as more people use shared transportation modes like car-sharing or ride-sharing services, they are also more likely to use public transit. Furthermore, households who do take advantage of these shared modes tend to own fewer cars and spend less on transportation overall.
Not A Congestion Solution
Whether or not cars are driven by people or computers, automobile congestion will continue to be one of the biggest challenges to mobility on our island. 
Our roadway network and parking lot infrastructure has a finite capacity, and fleets of driverless cars will not be able to reduce congestion or travel times during peak commute periods as Honolulu’s population continues to increase.
The city estimates that Oahu’s population will increase by 14 percent by 2030, to about 1.1 million residents. With our limited streets and parking lots, mass transportation will need to be part of the congestion solution.

The Honolulu rail system can move more than 7,200 passengers per hour per direction.

Rail transit remains the best solution for providing frequent, reliable transportation across the island.
Each of Honolulu’s driverless trains will be able to carry more than 600 people at a time, and will arrive every 5 minutes during rush hour. The rail system can move more than 7,200 passengers per hour per direction, and the driverless technology enables this capacity to be greatly expanded simply by adding more frequent trains.
Throughout the world, cities in China, India, Europe and elsewhere are continuing to build new urban metro systems while expanding existing lines. The great majority of these systems continue to be built using steel-wheel on steel-wheel technology, and this remains the technology of choice.
After more than 50 years of planning, our community is continuing on the right path to improve islandwide mobility for everyone. Emerging paradigms for shared and autonomous transportation will supplement the new rail system and offer attractive and economical mobility options for Honolulu’s future.

Car sharing is catching on in the country, especially among millennials, many of whom cannot afford to own a car because of the rising cost of living or who are too environmentally conscious to do so.
Car sharing is a relatively recent phenomenon in Malaysia. It is the next version of the car rental service, one that can be accessed through an app on a smartphone. The cars — be they new or peer-to-peer — can be hired for a few hours, a day or several days.
Enterprise spoke to four car-sharing app founders and CEOs to get a feel of the local market and some of the challenges they face in bringing this service to this market.
Moovby was the first such app to be introduced in the country. The peer-to-peer service came about when co-founder and chief technology officer Nik Muhammad Amin let a junior at university use his car to attend a convocation and got paid for it. “It was a lightbulb moment for me,” he says.
Nik started doing research on the car-sharing industry, trying to figure out if it was time to bring it to our shores. He decided to attend a Malaysian Global Innovation & Creative Centre (MaGIC) road tour to look at the possibility of setting up a business and it was here that he met Nadzri Sazali, co-founder of the company. “We attended MaGIC’s programme in Sabah and we invited another friend, who was good at product design, to help out,” he says.
After four months of being incubated by MaGIC, the trio received a RM150,000 grant from the Cradle Investment Programme (under CIP50), which enabled them to develop Moovby. The Cradle Investment Programme provides financial assistance to entrepreneurs to help them start technology-based ventures.

Kwikcar co-founder and CEO Jared Chan, on the other hand, was inspired to start his peer-to-peer car-sharing service on one of his visits back to Malaysia. He was living in Australia and when he came back for the holidays, he found readily available and appropriately priced rental cars difficult to come by.
So, he started Kwikcar for others like him who thought rental cars in the country were too overpriced. He believes he can achieve affordable rentals through this peer-to-peer car-sharing service. Having done his research, he knows that there are plenty of cars sitting idly in garages or parking lots that are ideal for such a service.
“Malaysia has the third highest ratio of cars per household in the world. Some 93% of all households in the country own a car and there are about 11 million passenger vehicles that are stationary for more than 20 hours a day,” Chan points out.
GoCar’s founding story is similar to that of Kwikcar. Founder TJ Tan was inspired to start the service when he came back for a vacation (also from Australia). He found the process of renting a car in
Malaysia unnecessarily tedious.
GoCar CEO Alan Cheah says its service offers a lot less hassle as those who want to rent a car can do so via its app. Tan started worked on the app in March 2015 and launched it in February the following year.
The new kid on the block, as far as car-sharing apps in the country go, is Socar. This app took off in South Korea and the company is hoping to replicate its success in Malaysia.
Most of these apps are only available in the Klang Valley, with the exception of  GoCar, whose services are also available in Langkawi. However, the concept is slowly catching on in the rest of the country. Drivers from Penang, Johor, Sabah and Sarawak are already trying to register themselves or their cars on these apps.
Socar is providing a test run of its “door-to-door” service (meaning that it delivers the car to your doorstep) in the Bangsar area for a flat fee of RM5. “You can choose where you want to pick up the car in Bangsar within certain hours and you drop off the car anywhere in Bangsar, also within certain hours,” says Socar Malaysia CEO Leon Foong.
Socar and GoCar provide brand-new car fleets for their car-sharing services. Socar charges RM8 per hour for its cheapest model, a Perodua Axia, while GoCar charges RM14.90 per hour for its cheapest model, the Nissan Almera.
GoCar’s fleet is supplied by the Mayflower car rental business. Cheah points out that GoCar’s fleet of cars belongs to the company as it finds the peer-to-peer model rather messy, with a lot of legal and insurance issues. “We are not heading into that until the issues are resolved. Right now, we have more than 180 cars. But we are adding cars every month. In fact, we are adding almost 50 cars a month,” he says.
“We have a huge variety of cars, from the Nissan Almera to seven-seaters for families and four-wheel drives. These are the most popular cars among the community. Our cars are either Nissans or Renaults.”
As for the peer-to-peer car-sharing services, prices vary depending on the car make. There is a large variety of cars provided, from regular sedans to sports cars with up to 700 horsepower. However, there are special rules for those who want to rent the more expensive cars, imposed by the service providers or the car owners themselves.
 
Helping millennials
Car sharing may be the best thing for millennials who want the freedom of driving without the burden of a car loan. But for those who choose to own their own car, such services could also help them with the loan.
“By renting out their cars every weekend, they can pretty much cover their car loans. That is really good because 25% of all millennial bankruptcy is due to unpaid car loans,” says Kwikcar’s Chan.
For instance, if someone lists his Perodua Myvi on Moovby, it will earn him about RM104 a day. If he rents it out four weekends a month, he could earn enough to pay for his loan, with a little left over as well.

But car sharing does not only earn those willing to participate extra pocket money. It is also good for the environment
A study conducted among 363 car-sharing respondents in the Netherlands, “Mobility and environmental impacts of car sharing in the Netherlands”, found 30% less car ownership among car sharers who also admitted that they drive 15% to 20% less than they did prior to car sharing.
According to the study, the shared cars mostly replace a second or third car. With reduced car ownership and car use, car sharers emit between 240 and 390 fewer kilogrammes of carbon dioxide per person, per year. This is between 13% and 18% of the carbon dioxide emissions related to car ownership and car use.
 
Insurance policies and safety
Moovby’s Nik admits that he had a hard time finding an insurance service provider that was on the ball or which kept up with the latest trends to insure cars and drivers. He went round to most of the insurance companies in Malaysia and was usually turned away with the usual reply: “I’m sorry, we do not provide such policies.”
He did not despair, however, and finally met the right insurance service provider. Allianz has been keeping up with most of the start-up trends and was the first insurer willing to come to the table and talk business.
Michael Fong, head of digital partnerships and innovation at Allianz, says the insurance coverage it currently provides car-sharing services in Malaysia is for personal accident and roadside assistance. He adds that since the company was already looking at ride sharing, addressing the needs of car-sharing providers was a natural progression.

“Because this is not vehicle attaching (which means the insurance is not attached to a specific vehicle but to the person driving the vehicle), it does not contravene any regulatory restrictions.
So, it is allowable to provide personal accident coverage for the driver as well as roadside assistance. I think this is really to take away some of the risks and challenges these platforms share,” says Fong
In Australia, for example, you can buy additional cover for your private car for ride and car sharing. “This allows you to do Uber and Grab and also put your vehicles on car-sharing platforms such as Kwikcar or Moovby,” says Fong.
He adds that Allianz goes the extra mile to ensure that the solutions provided are compliant with the provisions of regulators such as Bank Negara Malaysia and the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD).
“So, both regionally and locally, we are supportive of new economy start-up platforms because we are passionate about local entrepreneurs and start-ups,” says Fong, adding that there is also an environmental dimension to this.
“In Europe, car and bike sharing has alleviated the number of vehicles on the road. People have really moved from ownership to users. They take public transport and use car sharing for the last mile.”
Other than insurance, car-sharing service providers have put their own safety measures in place. Socar and GoCar, for instance, have a keyless unlock button that connects you to the app and permits an individual to unlock a car and start it.
Foong says when it comes to the safety of the car, many features can be installed to prevent theft or vandalism. But this mostly depends on a community’s mentality. “We leverage our members’ understanding of the principles behind car sharing, which means taking care of the car, not just preventing car theft but keeping it in good condition.”
Moovby has developed its own smart Internet of Things kit. “This kit is actually an advanced telematics kit installed in all Moovby cars. It can automate the locking system, start and stop the engine and provide real-time GPS as well as behaviour-tracking,” says Nik.
As for Kwikcar, a similar telematics device is installed in the cars. The idea is that the device will not just allow the company to track the car but also furnish it with data on consumer behaviour (how the car is used and where they are travelling, in terms of distance and location).
Chan says this provides Kwikcar with important data on peak demand times for the cars. “It gives us aggregated and not individual data.”
With four car-sharing services already in Malaysia, one may be forgiven for thinking that the market is getting a little crowded. But GoCar’s Cheah does not think so. “If you are looking at the long game, there is plenty of room for improvement, provided that the players focus on improving our transport ecosystem, rather than just coming in for commercial purposes,” he says.
Chan does not believe that car sharing will become obsolete with the introduction of new technologies such as self-driving cars, but he does think the business model may need to be tweaked over the next 5 to 10 years to keep up with the changes.
After all, car sharing is on trend. Nik says according to research by Navigant Research, worldwide membership in car-sharing programmes will grow from 2.3 million in 2013 to more than 12 million by 2020 as this model of shared personal transport is seen as a potential solution to global gridlock.
Self-driving cars
Though autonomous cars have yet to make a big impact on the world market, everyone agrees that it is just a matter of time. Where will that leave the car-sharing business?
Socar’s Foong, for one, is excited about autonomous cars. “We look forward to partner leaders in that space to offer car-sharing members even greater benefits. We are amazed by the possibilities and believe that car-sharing platforms will be a natural partner with our data and understanding of travel and traffic patterns.”
Cheah agrees, saying that autonomous vehicles will remove the line between car and ride sharing. The legislation, however, will need to catch up. “We need to prepare for the upcoming changes in the transport landscape as the introduction of autonomous vehicles will require fundamental changes to infrastructure, policies and mindsets.”

With fuel prices at their highest ever, carpooling is becoming even more enticing, on many levels: it helps us reduce our carbon footprint, contributes towards reducing time in the daily commute, saves money by splitting fuel costs and sharing parking, and lessens wear on the roads.
And, of course, there’s the fact that misery loves company, so you might as well make a new friend in traffic than suffer in silence. With millions of single occupants commuting the world over, it’s time that we ditched our addiction to solo travel and started carpooling.
Finding people to share your commute has become much easier too, with technology driving ride-sharing apps such as uGoMyWay, LocoMute, FindaLift and Jumpin Rides, which either connect passengers with empty seats, or connect drivers with the nearest available cars.
uGoMyWay, FindaLift and Jumpin Rides are ride-sharing platforms connecting drivers and commuters who are going in the same direction, allowing you to log your trip and calculate how much you need to pay towards costs. LocoMute, an alternative to vehicle owning, gives members access to cars around South Africa, taking care of fuel, insurance, parking and e-tolls.
Consider the implications 
But before you start charging for rides or listing your car to share with strangers, you might want to consider the insurance implications. Have you thought about what would happen if you were involved in a crash, or your car was damaged or stolen while being “shared”? Would your insurance kick in? Could your injured passengers have a claim against you?
Of course there are always horror stories: in 2017 a reader complained about a “ride renting” company that pre-screened customers and offered insurance, but then his car disappeared, along with the customer. Months later, the reader was still fighting for the insurer to pay out. Carpooling isn’t necessarily the best option either.
Vera Nagtegaal, the executive head of Hippo.co.za, says carpooling is practicable on many levels, but drivers need to be sensible.
“The simplest way to divvy up the responsibilities is to travel in a different person’s car on different days of the week,” she said, ‘but sometimes it makes sense for one person to be the designated driver and charge the others for the cost of fuel.”
Carpooling can be a way to save money and reduce traffic congestion, but make sure your insurance is in line with such plans. File photo: Hassan Ammar / AP
Nagtegaal warns that if you’re receiving payment, you might want to consider upgrading your insurance. “If you are using one person’s car and money is changing hands, this could potentially be seen by an insurer as a commercial transaction, especially if the money you’re receiving is more than the operating costs.
“In this instance, this could mean that your car is being used for business purposes, and you should have a different type of insurance cover – and even a special permit to be
If you’re only covering your fuel costs and possibly wear and tear, insurers are unlikely to take issue with it though. Nagtegaal says personal short-term insurance policies exclude fare-paying passenger transport, but if you’re using your car for anything other than personal use – if it’s effectively being used for business purposes – you need to update your policy. Of course you should already be familiar with the contents of your insurance policy.
She warns that if you don’t update your policy, your insurance claim could be rejected – which could cripple you financially. Exercise common sense: if you’re meeting potential carpoolers, do so in a public space, or better yet, share lifts with people you know and trust. Be very sure about the driver’s credentials – do they even have a driving licence? Is their car roadworthy and insured?
Share the load
Set the rules: state your position on lateness and eating in the car to avoid conflict. Download the Nomola app on your smart device: supported by DialDirect, the app promises to get you emergency help. Users can request assistance from public emergency services, such as the police, metro police, fire and rescue, and ambulance.
Share the load: if you only want to split the costs of driving to and from work, alternate cars.

Arlington, Texas, is a large suburb about 20 miles west of Dallas. Its last census count was almost 400,000. It plays host to the Texas Rangers’ baseball stadium, the Dallas Cowboys’ football stadium and the original Six Flags theme park.
And now, it can add another notch to its belt: Arlington just became the first city in the United States to replace its entire municipal bus system with a fleet of vans from ridesharing provider Via.
The partnership is the latest evidence of a recent push toward app-based ridesharing services in favor of traditional public transit. Summit, N.J., and Altamonte Springs, Fla., have joined forces with Uber to provide subsidized rides to commuters, saving the cities hundreds of thousands of dollars while keeping costs down for customers.






In Arlington, Via vans pick up passengers on demand for a $3 fare. The company’s technology connects multiple passengers who are headed the same way, allowing riders to request a ride in real time and share a conveniently routed vehicle.
And it’s not just the good old U.S. of A that’s getting in on the rideshare game. Via has also been tapped to develop an on-demand public bus service in Singapore, a venture that Via CEO and co-founder Daniel Ramot is “thrilled” to begin.
“We are very excited to partner with the Land Transit Authority to bring an innovative on-demand public bus service to Singapore powered by Via’s tried and tested shared ride technology,” said Ramot, a native of Israel and a graduate of Hebrew University, Tel Aviv University and Stanford University who has a Ph.D in neuroscience.
“Singapore is at the forefront of mobility innovation in the region, and we are thrilled to see Via’s technology in Southeast Asia for the first time.”

In addition to Singapore and Arlington, Via has launched on-demand transit services in Queenstown, New Zealand, and Newcastle, Australia, with operations in Berlin, Germany; and Los Angeles and West Sacramento, Calif., coming later in 2018.

If you hope to disrupt a market, it would be better to cooperate with the authorities to ensure that your service is here to stay. This is a lesson that Ng Yong Ching, who was previously city leader for Grab in Melaka and is now launching Singapore-based bike-sharing platform oBike in Malaysia, has learnt.
“The one thing the two services have in common is that we are doing something new. So, there is no framework or law governing the service. In the beginning, Grab did not have any legislation to govern it either. Now it does, which I see as progress. I am hoping to see the same sort of progress for oBike,” he says.
The relationship between disruptors and regulators can be tricky. Just look at the legal issues global ride-hailing giant Uber faced in multiple countries. While regulators may be eager to encourage new modes of transport, they have to ensure that the necessary rules and framework are implemented to protect consumers.
oBike has had its fair share of issues. Last September, more than 200 of its bikes in Petaling Jaya were seized for causing obstruction on sidewalks and for operating without a licence. According to reports, the company was fined RM17,000 by the Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ). Some of the bikes that were not parked properly were also seized in Subang Jaya.
Ng says the issue with MBPJ was miscommunication, which has been sorted out quickly with the help of the Selangor government. “We are trying to work with the authorities to provide alternative transport to fill the last mile between public transport stops and final destinations.
No matter what the service, if you want it to go well and benefit more people, you need to work closely with the authorities to come up with suitable plan.
“Bike sharing is currently new in Malaysia. The authorities do not have a regulatory framework to refer to, so sorting out the issues may take time. We are trying to help by sharing the information we have about how we operate in different countries.”
oBike is now in 15 countries. It offers a stationless bike-sharing system that users can access through a mobile app. The bike’s location can be tracked using the app and once the user is done with the ride, he can park and lock the bike in designated parking spots that do not obstruct traffic or walkways. Ng says the app has more than 500,000 users in Malaysia, who have made over one million trips in the first eight months of its operations.

When oBike first arrived in the country, the company had to educate the authorities and the public on how the system worked, even though bike-sharing is fairly common in other countries.
There were concerns about the lack of cycling lanes and the cluttering of bicycles on pavements became an eyesore.
“Of course everyone knows that cycling is not that popular in this country, so the biggest challenge was getting Malaysians to understand the bike-sharing concept and how it could benefit them,” says Ng.
oBike is tackling one problem at a time, breaking down the barriers to entry in this market. For instance, the company is working with the authorities to address the lack of cycling lanes by helping to identify the demand for them.
“We can track the data and share the routes. When we share the results with the authorities, they are happy. We understand that they have limited resources and it is impossible for them to make bike lanes everywhere. With our data, we show them which areas should have priority,” says Ng, adding that oBike shares its data on the most popular biking routes on a monthly basis or on-demand.
“We will inform them of the issues on the ground and provide feedback. We are glad that Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) just announced that the first city bicycle lane will be completed in January 2018. So, very soon, people can use it and more will come in,” he says.
“Of course, good infrastructure will give more people the confidence to take up biking. But this is a phase we need to go through. The infrastructure has to be implemented and one day, it will be. In the meantime, all the people who are already using what is available will give the authorities confidence that they are doing the right thing [by putting in bike lanes].”
How Malaysians should and shouldn’t bike
Last April, oBike launched its service in Selangor. By October, it had expanded to Kuala Terengganu, Muar and Kluang. Ng says the company goes into new cities often on the invitation of city councils after surveying the needs of the town. Approval for operations is on a city-by-city basis.
“In Kuala Terengganu, for example, it makes sense to cycle around because the city is not too big, the traffic is not too heavy and there are quite a number of tourists. I can say we are surprised by the growth, especially among youngsters and college students because there are a few colleges there. Tourists who go for day tours also like to use the bikes,” says Ng.
In Kluang, on the other hand, the oBikes are mostly used in the park. “It is more recreational for now. In Muar, it started in the parks as well. The town is not too big and there are parking issues, so it makes sense for people to cycle. There, it is not really the tourists or students using the bikes, but the locals. There is also a high demand [for the bikes] on weekends for recreational purposes,” he says.
In terms of growth, the company saw the biggest leap in Kuala Terengganu. But KL still has the highest number of users. Most of them are tourists and working adults.
“They use the bikes a lot during lunchtime. When you are in the city centre, it is hard to find a parking spot and you do not want to move your car when you go for lunch, in case you cannot find another parking spot when you get back. Cycling makes it easier to have lunch nearby,” says Ng.
Users usually cycle between 1km and 3km for less than 15 minutes, according to Ng. Most of the trips are also on less busy roads, he points out.
“We do send out a lot of educational messages to the users, telling them what they should take note of when they are cycling. For instance, we tell them not to cycle on highways and to make sure they keep to the left side of the road. Although there are no bicycle lanes on a lot of the roads, when there is less traffic, it is okay to cycle there,” says Ng.
Another issue bike-sharing platforms such as oBike face is their bikes being vandalised. Pictures of bikes mounted on road signs or dumped by the side of the road have gone viral on social media, igniting a debate on whether people are civil enough to appreciate such a service. But such vandalism is not unique to Malaysia, Ng is quick to point out, and the losses are currently manageable.
“We believe most of the vandalism or damage done to the bikes is not by our users because they appreciate the service. The point of oBike is that it is not your personal bike and you have access to 10,000 of them,” he adds.
A feature oBike is working on that will deter vandalism or bad parking is a geofence technology that can detect where or how the bike is parked. For instance, if a bike is parked on the pavement instead of a designated area, the user will be penalised.
“The user will lose credit points, which will increase their fares. The opposite applies. If you do things the right way, we will reward you,” says Ng.

Other challenges oBike faces include cybersecurity risks. Last December, it was reported that a global data breach occurred on its app, affecting users in five markets, including Singapore. Some usernames, email addresses and mobile numbers were stolen by the hackers.
Ng says the company is aware of this issue and has fixed the problem. “We have worked quickly to resolve this issue. As a tech company, user data and security are of paramount importance to us. We are now focusing our efforts on assessing the impact with the relevant stakeholders and assuring all our users that our systems have been fully restored and are secure.”
Ensuring customer satisfaction will be increasingly important to oBike as more competitors enter the Malaysian market. China-based Ofo, also a stationless bike-sharing system, expanded to Melaka last August. Mobike, another China-based company with a similar business model, launched its services in Shah Alam and Setia Alam last September.
Ng is confident oBike can defend its market by offering more value-added services and lowering prices. Currently, it charges 50 sen for every 30 minutes. “We are talking to our partners to provide some rewards. Just imagine when you go anywhere you have a special rate from the partner because they provide a spot and they are welcoming the user.
All this can be done and hopefully by the next quarter, we will be rolling this out,” he says.
“We are the first to launch the service and we remain the largest. So, I think we did the groundwork and created a wider path for our competitors. Everyone knows about bike-sharing now, especially the authorities. In the end, it will benefit the whole community.”

 Should I use my own bike or car sharing for my shopping tour? Should I travel to work by train or rely on ridesharing? Should I take a taxi or an e-bike to get to a leisure location?



Each activity in daily life might require a different form of mobility, and sometimes it makes sense to link some appointments.
In the future, the optimum solution could be suggested by a mobility app. A prototype of an electronic assistant for mobility customers and other tools for providers of mobility services were recently presented by the BiE project.
Our mobility behavior is changing: Attractive public passenger transport services or flexible services such as car sharing are gaining importance. The BiE project (Evaluation of Integrated E-Mobility) focuses on how to better harmonize such services and integrate them into the users’ daily life, find out where e-mobility fits in, and develop corresponding prototypes.
The results include an app that provides personal mobility assistance. Populated with data specifying individual preferences and mobility needs, it is able to make specific suggestions for your personal daily mobility behavior. The assistant not only integrates e-mobility, but all mobility types, such as local and long-distance public transportation services, private motor transport, bicycle, walking, and any combination of them.
The user’s upcoming appointments over the day are matched with the current road traffic and public transportation states so that any possible leeway can be used for travel planning. Such assistance could enable individual users to optimally coordinate their daily routine with their mobility needs, to receive updated suggestions for planning the necessary travel in case of unexpected events, and – as a side effect – to keep their families and appointment partners updated.

Arising from this insight, the question for the BiE project was how big the influence of such an assistance feature could be on the mobility needs of an entire region. The Institute for Transport Studies of KIT investigated this question taking the example of the Stuttgart region.
Calculation models were used to determine the effects: The result was that this assistance feature can significantly reduce the average number and duration of trips as well as the distances to be covered. For half of the use cases, the assistance feature was able to offer advantageous alternatives. The use of electric vehicles for private transport could provide an attractive mobility solution for conurbations such as the greater Stuttgart area.
For fleet operators, BiE concurrently developed a prediction model for the use of e-vehicles that factors in customer preferences, driving behavior, and vehicle consumption characteristics. Thanks to machine learning, a reliable prediction of the distance the user wants to cover and the car in the fleet that is sufficiently charged and has an adequate distance to empty is possible. Building on this data, booking offers and even the daily planning of the fleet bases can be optimized.
BiE is developing another consulting system that will help organizations such as municipalities, companies, or neighborhood communities to deploy new vehicle fleets. Various input parameters, such as organization size, number of persons, and mobility behavior, allow the system to predict reliably whether and under which conditions the introduction of e-mobility makes sense.
The output is a mobility architecture recommendation tailored to the individual needs, including statements on the dimension of investments, infrastructures, utilization, and economic efficiency of e-mobility solutions for almost any environment.
The overall objective of the BiE project is to design an evaluation system for the integration of e-mobility based on key indicators. Possible use scenarios will be simulated and validated prior to their implementation using novel concepts.
The underlying networked mobility models were developed by the Institute of Product Engineering at KIT. With these models, individual recommendations adapted to each situation and based on a holistic system of key indicators became possible. Thus, the BiE partners can identify an appropriate infrastructure of charging stations for vehicle fleets, detect cooperation options of various service providers, or analyze traffic flows.
The BiE (Evaluation of Integrated E-Mobility) project was funded with more than EUR 2 million by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research for two and a half years during the second funding period of the E-Mobility South-West leading-edge cluster.

Eleven partners from different industries actively participated in BiE: Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) contributed latest scientific aspects through its Institute for Transport Studies (IfV), its Institute of Product Engineering (IPEK), and its FZI Research Center for Information Technology. From the industry, the following companies took part: Bosch, cantamen GmbH, esentri AG, RA Consulting GmbH, Raumobil GmbH, and TWT GmbH Science & Innovation. Two large regional car sharing operators, Stadtmobil Karlsruhe and Stadtmobil Rhein-Neckar, have agreed to act as pilot partners for the technical test phase.
E-Mobility South-West leading-edge cluster
80 players from industry and science make the E-Mobility South-West leading-edge cluster one of the most important regional associations in the field of e-mobility. Managed by the State Agency e-mobil BW GmbH, the cluster is aimed at promoting the industrialization of e-mobility in Germany and making Baden-Württemberg a major provider of electric mobility solutions.

Self-driving cars
(By David Gutman, The Seattle Times)
Fully self-driving cars aren’t quite here yet, but they’re coming. Gov. Jay Inslee signed an executive order earlier this month welcoming companies to use Washington roads as a testing ground for driverless cars.
With the vast majority of collisions caused by human error, self-driving cars carry the potential to dramatically decrease crashes on the road.
But, especially while self-driving cars share the road with standard ones, it’s unlikely that collisions will disappear entirely. An Uber self-driving car crashed in Arizona in March, and a Tesla in autopilot mode crashed in Florida last year, killing its driver.

Regardless of who or what was at fault in those instances, self-driving cars will still have to interact with drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians.
Which raises the question for this week’s Traffic Lab Q&A: Who’s responsible if a self-driving car is involved in – or causes – a crash?
“If an accident occurs and it’s deemed the error was on the part of the self-driving auto, who gets sued?” asked John McLain, of Whidbey Island. “Do you seek redress from the vehicle’s owner or from the manufacturer? If two self-driving vehicles collide, how would insurance companies sort out who pays for the property damage?”
None of the answers to those questions are settled, but scholars and experts in the field tend to have two, general assumptions: Widespread use of self-driving cars will mean fewer collisions, and there will be some shifting of liability from drivers to manufacturers.
“In comparison to the automotive industry today, the automated driving industry will likely bear a bigger slice of a smaller pie of total crash costs,” writes Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of Southern California and an expert on the law of self-driving cars.
States are generally responsible for establishing liability and insurance rules and, indeed, the federal government’s guidance on self-driving cars, released last year, put the onus on the states.
“States should consider how to allocate liability among (autonomous vehicle) owners, operators, passengers, manufacturers and others when a crash occurs,” the guidance from the U.S. Department of Transportation says.
In Washington state, as of now, there’s no clear answer. And there really isn’t much of an answer anywhere else either. Inslee’s executive order only requires companies testing self-driving cars to carry car insurance, as any driver has to do under state law.
Kara Klotz, a spokeswoman for state Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler, said they’re monitoring the issue, but don’t currently have regulations specific to self-driving cars.
“It’s a whole new way of thinking about auto insurance, and we let the insurance industry kind of innovate and come up with products, and then we’ll review those,” Klotz said.
And the insurance industry’s response, generally, is: We’re working on it.

Michigan late last year became the first state to pass legislation addressing self-driving cars and insurance.
That law says that if an autonomous vehicle’s operating system is at fault for a collision, then the manufacturer is responsible.
Right now, in the very early stages of a possible wave of self-driving cars, the insurance industry is most focused on getting access to the information it will need to determine who or what is at fault in a collision, said Bob Passmore, an assistant vice president with the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.
Currently, if two cars collide, either the drivers work it out, or police or insurers talk to the drivers and examine the evidence to make a determination of who’s at fault.
As cars become more automated, that’s going to shift, with drivers becoming less able to say what caused a collision. “It’s not just what you did or didn’t do, it’s what the car did or did not do,” Passmore said. “The only way to talk to a vehicle that drives itself is to get the data and the information that the vehicle used to make its decisions.”
The insurance industry wants access to that data. Carmakers want to make sure their proprietary self-driving systems – oftentimes top secret – won’t be disclosed. And drivers have a justifiable concern about privacy.
There’s already a broad set of product liability law that has been used in famous automotive cases – the Ford Pinto’s fuel system, Firestone tires and Takata air bags, to name a few. The challenge, experts say, will be to take existing law and use it to determine if a self-operating system is at fault.
That could be done on a case-by-case basis – was the self-driving car speeding? Did it run a red light? – or it could require changes to the law. “We’re taking a sort of existing body of law and we’re applying that body of law to new facts,” said Jim Whittle, an associate general counsel for the American Insurance Association. “Will it fit? Will it need to be adjusted? Do we want to have a more efficient system for resolving these matters? Those are the sort of public-policy questions that may need to evolve.”
No one knows exactly when those questions are going to need to be answered. Partially autonomous vehicles are already here. Fully autonomous ones – with no driver input necessary – are likely only a few years away.
But it could be decades before they dominate the roadways. “A year from now, my guess is this is going to be the number 1 issue in the industry,” said Kenton Brine, president of the NW Insurance Council. “The technology is already ahead of the organization of the system and how we’re insuring it.”

As the car-sharing market in Japan rapidly expands, major automakers have been pressing down on the accelerator to get a share of the business.
Against a backdrop of consumers shifting away from “possessing” their own vehicle to “sharing” one, the automaker business model centered on vehicle production and sales has reached a turning point.
In an underground parking lot in Tokyo’s Shinjuku area, three Nissan Motor Co. vehicles used in the automaker’s car-sharing service are lined up together. By completing a membership registration in advance and reserving a vehicle through a smartphone, a car can be borrowed for fees that start from 200 yen for 15 minutes.
“I like driving but maintaining a car is expensive, so I’d never thought about buying one of my own,” said one user, a 44-year-old company employee from Toshima Ward, Tokyo.
Nissan entered the car-sharing business in January. It has 44 vehicles available in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and elsewhere, and plans to add to the fleet.
Although no earnings targets have been indicated for its car-sharing service, Nissan President Hiroto Saikawa said that a business that generates profit by having cars in use generates a large added value.
It is also a source of great appeal, he added. Nissan also is studying the feasibility of a pickup service using self-driving vehicles.

Commuters in Cardiff could save over £700 if they car shared with four or more people three days out of the working week.
New research from a national commuting survey by leading automotive retailer, Inchcape paints a colourful picture of car sharing potential.
The full report highlights how commuters across the country could be saving themselves time and money, whilst also helping to tackle congestion, pollution and traffic jams.
People in Cardiff that drive to work could save over £300 annually (£311.26) if they car shared two days a week with two people in the car. This could be upped to £466.89 if they car shared for three days.
By adding even more people to the car, even further savings could be made. Based on three people sharing, annual savings could reach over £600.
The study of over 2,000 car commuters across Wales, England, Northern Ireland and Scotland reveals the average weekly spend in the UK on driving to work is £38.72, equivalent to more than £1,700 over the course of a year.

The research compares commuting costs and potential savings across the major cities.
On average in the UK, if four people were to share the commute twice a week they could each save £527 annually – the price of return flights to the Maldives. Upped to three times per week, they could each save almost £791.
If three people were to share twice a week they could each save £468 and even if just two people carpooled each person could make a substantial saving of £351.
This study is supported by Touchpoints data which shows 18.6 million people in the UK commute alone by car whilst only 12.3 million car share.
If just 10% of people currently commuting alone paired up and car shared twice a week, the combined saving would be over £650 million per year.
In addition to financial savings, drivers who car share could save almost 20 minutes on their daily journey, according to YouGov.
The average commute time for those travelling alone is 72 minutes whilst for those car sharing it’s less than an hour at 54 minutes.

Ford Motor is looking to tap opportunities in India for its smart mobility services.
The company’s arm Ford Smart Mobility LLC will initiate a pilot project of its smart shuttle services involving its employees in Chennai by the end of this year.
Raj Rao, chief executive of Ford Smart Mobility, said to the Economic Times (in an article By Sharmistha Mukherjee) that “On the vision of city of the future, three things were (made) clear.

More things have to be shared in mobility, more cars will have to be electrified over a period of time and they have to be connected.


That is the DNA of change for India”.

He said the ongoing creation of new roads and infrastructure will also call for usage of data to improve schedules and routes for vehicles as well as incentivise people to share.

On September 18, Ford Motor and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. (M&M), agreed to explore a strategic alliance to leverage mutual strengths such as mobility programmes, connected vehicle projects, electrification, product development.

Bike sharing is exploding in Asia.
China has now more than 100 milliion riders registered.
In Shanghai, five out of 10 people surveyed used a shared bike daily or several times a week.
Singapore had the highest percentage of people who changed from a private car or taxi to a bicycle. Taipei came in second.
Jessica Jaganathan and Florence Tan (CSMonitor.com) mention that “The general belief is that [it] boosts the utilization of public transport as shared bikes help to complete the journey,” said Harry Liu, downstream consultant with IHS Markit.

Basically helps the cities with the last mile problem.
It also get people dropping their cars, which means less gasoline consuption
This bike sharing also boost a healthy lifestyle and pollution control.
The inconvenience?
Maqsudul Hasan Nuri (Shangai Daily) points out that “Road planners in China have some reservations on the unchecked growth. These include too many bikes, vandalism and bikes dropped in the middle of roads and sidewalks, creating a danger to traffic and pedestrians.
It can also affect car sales.

Driverless cars have already gotten component suppliers re-evaluating their product designs and functionality. However, it’s the growing global trend of shared mobility that will spark another significant product design rethink.



EZ10 driverless shuttle from EasyMile

A recent ABI Research report predicts that trends toward shared mobility will transform the vehicle interior, and as result, compel car manufacturers and suppliers to adjust, tweak or overhaul product offerings. ABI Research forecasts that there will be more than 11 million shared driverless vehicles operating on the roads globally by 2030, serving an average of 64 users per shared driverless vehicle.
In short time, as cars become more fully driverless and private-car ownership car-on-demand shareability, car interiors will require greater configurability to change to the individual needs and preferences of whoever is using the vehicle at the time, according to ABI Research.
“Car OEMs and other automotive newcomers have been imagining the interior of the driverless vehicle for some time, usually focusing on the fact that fully autonomous operation will do away with all of the usual driver distraction concerns and enable the occupant to fully engage in other tasks,” said James Hodgson, ABI’s industry analyst, in a statement. “But they now must consider how they can deliver a personalized in-vehicle experience for consumers who will not own the vehicles that they are using.”
Well-known design firm IDEO has a take on what “Moving Together” may look. In its video presenting the future of automobility, IDEO’s redesigned car features individual pods to meet passengers’ needs for privacy, productivity and relaxation.
Other features include swivel chairs that can turn inward towards the center of car’s interior or outward to the individual passenger’s door, which opens and closes automatically; embedded personal screens; noise cancelling technology, and ways allowing passengers to ride in social or private mode.

As Wired reported in February, future cars–envisioned by IDEO and many others in the car industry– will switch the notion of a car being a private vehicle for an individual or a family into a public resource shared by strangers.
ABI Research noted that concept cars, including the Volkswagen I.D. Buzz, the Rinspeed Oasis and the Chrysler Portal, are moving in this direction. They all featured physically and digitally reconfigurable interiors which allow passengers to use the features in different ways.
ABI Research’s Hodgson added, “Delivering a seamless mobility service, with an adaptable interior space that can accommodate the consumer’s unique needs, tastes, and preferences will increasingly become the objective of OEMs as they transition from car sellers to service providers.”
For auto industry suppliers –already under pressure to deliver products meeting stricter environmental and safety standards, manage risks and liabilities, and control costs– these trends pose new challenges and opportunities.
In many cases, it will mean even more electronic components in cars and, obviously, devices that can interact in the world of the Internet of Things and machine-to-machine compatibility.
And, as Deloitte University Press points out customization for these new driverless and shareable cars may happen closer to the time of sale. This would shift car production even more towards a build-to-order, just-in-time model, requiring different inventory planning and logistics strategies.
How are you rethinking your supply chain practices for the changing auto industry? What design changes are you considering, and what features of the future car need the most attention?

The technology is intended to give drivers more information on the potential state of their impending fare, it’s also been criticised for its potential to give drivers the justification to refuse a fare, potentially leaving them more vulnerable.
Filed in 2016, the technology patent assesses interactions by the customer through their phone with the Uber app, such as how the passenger is holding their phone and if they are swaying, how fast they are walking user’s walking speed, and whether they are any typos in their communications.
This, it suggests, could “predict user state using machine learning” and recognise “uncharacteristic user states”.
The patent states that the tech would help Uber “take an action to reduce undesired consequences” related to intoxicated passengers.

However critics of the impending technology have said it opens passengers to potential discrimination by drivers, who gain much of their trade from people out drinking and not driving themselves home.
It also raises questions about safety and sexual assault, for both drivers and passengers.
A CNN investigation found that 103 Uber drivers in the US alone had been accused of “sexually assaulting or abusing” their passengers in the past four years.
Such technology would feasibly enable a driver to identify passengers that were at their most vulnerable, information that could be used in both a positive and negative manner.
An Uber spokesperson has noted that the AI is still a work in progress, with many patents never actually reaching reality.

It wasn’t what you’d call a profound observation, but the gears in Davies’ head began turning.
What if it was possible for other people to use these idle vehicles while they weren’t in use; what if those could then subsidise the owner’s on-road costs?
Car Next Door was born, and together with IT guru Dave Trumbull Davies a company has evolved that has grown in all key metrics 500 per cent in the last two years.
The car-sharing platform currently boasts a fleet of 1300 shareable cars available to 50,000 members.
With wheels on the ground in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, Car Next Door has successfully completed over 100,000 bookings and has plans to go nationwide in 2018.
As pleased as he is with Car Next Door’s stratospheric growth, Davies said the true goal of the business is to radically disrupt the “traditional” way of owning and running a vehicle.
“The current model of car ownership is crazy – it’s costly and wasteful. Car Next Door started as a common-sense solution to the waste caused by millions of cars sitting doing nothing all day,” Davies told 9Finance.

“It helps ordinary people cut down on the huge expense of owning a car. It costs a two-car family something like $22,000 a year to get around, that’s a big outgoing on the yearly budget.”
In practical terms, the way it works is simple: a user keen to borrow a car signs up to Car Next Door’s website to be approved, and once they are given the green light they can choose and book an available car.
Once a car is found, there’s no need for awkward chit-chat with the owner (who’s probably at work) because the vehicle’s keys are in a waterproof digital safe that hangs over one of the rear windows.
Having any old punter off the street drive around your pride and joy sounds like a disaster for most automotive purists, but Davies said they’ve ironed out all the bugs around lending cars to terrible drivers.
“Central to our success is a strict membership criteria, an easy to use online booking and payment system, insurance and high end, in-vehicle technology to make the transaction safe, fast, and hassle-free for both owners and borrowers,” Davies said.
“We’ve got comprehensive insurance that covers anyone driving the car and strict standards that both the car owners and the car borrowers have to meet to become members, and if they don’t stick to the rules then they’re out.”
Unlike other businesses in the share economy that have you delivering food by bike or using your car as a faux taxi, Davies said most car owners aren’t on Car Next Door with dollar signs in their eyes.
“Most people aren’t in this to make squillions – they are paying high fixed costs each year to register, insure, finance and maintain a car, so it makes sense to offset those costs by renting it out when they’re not using it,” he said.

“The average earnings for a car owner is around $3500 a year, but people who are really looking to make a profit will put vans on the platform – some people are earning upwards of $10,000 a year that way.”
Ten years ago such a business would’ve fallen at every step – from finding a place to securely keep the keys to the filling out of insurance documents – the obstacles were simply too many.
But as Australians, and in particular the inner-city residents of Sydney and Melbourne, warm to the idea of the share-economy it seems there’s little to slow the progress of Car Next Door.
“Cars are used for less than 5 percent of the day, on average,” Davies said.
“Fewer young people are wanting to invest in cars – they’re more interested in mobility on demand.
“Developments like ride-share apps, traditional and emerging forms of car sharing and, eventually, the evolution of driverless vehicles will see the market for personal transport changing in the coming years.”

Until recently, city leaders thought of smart technologies primarily as tools for becoming more efficient behind the scenes. Now technology is being injected more directly into the lives of residents. Smartphones have become the keys to the city, putting instant information about transit, traffic, health services, safety alerts, and community news into millions of hands.







Today, cities are moving beyond the pilot stage and using data and digital technologies to deliver results that are more relevant and meaningful to residents.


After a decade of trial and error, municipal leaders are realizing that smart-city strategies start with people, not technology. “Smartness” is not just about installing digital interfaces in traditional infrastructure or streamlining city operations. It is also about using technology and data purposefully to make better decisions and deliver a better quality of life.
Quality of life has many dimensions, from the air residents breathe to how safe they feel walking the streets. The latest report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), Smart cities: Digital solutions for a more livable future (PDF–6MB), analyzes how dozens of digital applications address these kinds of practical and very human concerns. It finds that cities can use smart technologies to improve some key quality-of-life indicators by 10 to 30 percent—numbers that translate into lives saved, fewer crime incidents, shorter commutes, a reduced health burden, and carbon emissions averted.

What makes a city smart?
Smart cities put data and digital technology to work to make better decisions and improve the quality of life. More comprehensive, real-time data gives agencies the ability to watch events as they unfold, understand how demand patterns are changing, and respond with faster and lower-cost solutions.
Three layers work together to make a smart city hum (Exhibit 1). First is the technology base, which includes a critical mass of smartphones and sensors connected by high-speed communication networks. The second layer consists of specific applications. Translating raw data into alerts, insight, and action requires the right tools, and this is where technology providers and app developers come in. The third layer is usage by cities, companies, and the public. Many applications succeed only if they are widely adopted and manage to change behavior. They encourage people to use transit during off-hours, to change routes, to use less energy and water and to do so at different times of day, and to reduce strains on the healthcare system through preventive self-care.

Exhibit 1


 

Smart-city technologies have substantial unrealized potential to improve the urban quality of life
MGI assessed how smart-city applications could affect various quality-of-life dimensions: safety, time and convenience, health, environmental quality, social connectedness and civic participation, jobs, and the cost of living (see interactive). The wide range of outcomes reflects the fact that applications perform differently from city to city, depending on factors such as legacy infrastructure systems and on baseline starting points.



Interactive













Applications can help cities fight crime and improve other aspects of public safety
Deploying a range of applications to their maximum effect could potentially reduce fatalities (from homicide, road traffic, and fires) by 8 to 10 percent. In a high-crime city with a population of five million, this could mean saving up to 300 lives each year. Incidents of assault, robbery, burglary, and auto theft could be lowered by 30 to 40 percent. On top of these metrics are the incalculable benefits of giving residents freedom of movement and peace of mind.
Technology is not a quick fix for crime, but agencies can use data to deploy scarce resources and personnel more effectively. Real-time crime mapping, for instance, utilizes statistical analysis to highlight patterns, while predictive policing goes a step further, anticipating crime to head off incidents before they occur. When incidents do occur, applications such as gunshot detection, smart surveillance, and home security systems can accelerate law-enforcement response. But data-driven policing has to be deployed in a way that protects civil liberties and avoids criminalizing specific neighborhoods or demographic groups.
Seconds count when lives are at stake, making speed critical for first responders in getting to the scene of emergencies. Smart systems can optimize call centers and field operations, while traffic-signal preemption gives emergency vehicles a clear driving path. These types of applications could cut emergency response times by 20 to 35 percent. A city with an already low response time of eight minutes could shave off almost two minutes. A city starting with an average response time of 50 minutes might be able to trim that by more than 17 minutes.
Smart-city technologies can make daily commutes faster and less frustrating
Tens of millions of people in cities worldwide begin and end every workday fuming in traffic or piling into overcrowded buses and trains. Improving the daily commute is critical to quality of life.
By 2025, cities that deploy smart-mobility applications have the potential to cut commuting times by 15 to 20 percent on average, with some people enjoying even larger reductions. The potential associated with each application is highly variable, depending on each city’s density, existing transit infrastructure, and commuting patterns. In a dense city with extensive transit, smart technologies could save the average commuter almost 15 minutes a day. In a developing city with more grueling commutes, the improvement might be 20 to 30 minutes every day.
In general, cities with extensive, well-used transit systems benefit from applications that streamline the experience for riders. Using digital signage or mobile apps to deliver real-time information about delays enables riders to adjust their routes on the fly. Installing IoT sensors on existing physical infrastructure can help crews fix problems before they turn into breakdowns and delays.
Applications that ease road congestion are more effective in cities where driving is prevalent or where buses are the primary mode of transit. Intelligent syncing of traffic signals has the potential to reduce average commutes by more than 5 percent in developing cities where most people travel by bus. Real-time navigation alerts drivers to delays and helps them choose the fastest route. Smart-parking apps point them directly to available spots, eliminating time spent fruitlessly circling city blocks.
Cities can be catalysts for better health
The sheer density of cities makes them critical although currently underutilized platforms for addressing health. Recognizing that the role of technology in healthcare is broad and evolving by the day, we analyze only digital applications that offer cities room to play a role. We quantify their potential impact on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), the primary metric used by the World Health Organization to convey the global disease burden, reflecting not only years of life lost to early death but also productive and healthy life lost to disability or incapacity. If cities deploy the applications included in our analyses to their fullest effect, we see the potential to reduce DALYs by 8 to 15 percent.
Applications that help prevent, treat, and monitor chronic conditions, such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease, could make the biggest difference in the developed world. Remote-patient-monitoring systems have the potential to reduce the health burden in high-income cities by more than 4 percent. These systems use digital devices to take vital readings, then transmit them securely to doctors in another location for assessment. This data can alert both patient and doctor when early intervention is needed, heading off complications and hospitalizations.
Cities can use data and analytics to identify demographic groups with elevated risk profiles and target interventions more precisely. So-called mHealth interventions can send out lifesaving messages about vaccinations, sanitation, safe sex, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy regimens. In low-income cities with high infant-mortality rates, data-based interventions focused on maternal and child health alone could reduce DALYs by more than 5 percent. Another 5 percent reduction is possible if developing cities use infectious-disease surveillance systems to stay a step ahead of fast-moving epidemics. Telemedicine, which provides clinical consultations by videoconference, can also be lifesaving in low-income cities with doctor shortages.
Smart cities can deliver a cleaner and more sustainable environment
As urbanization, industrialization, and consumption grow, environmental pressures multiply. Applications such as building-automation systems, dynamic electricity pricing, and some mobility applications could combine to cut emissions by 10 to 15 percent.
Water-consumption tracking, which pairs advanced metering with digital feedback messages, can nudge people toward conservation and reduce consumption by 15 percent in cities where residential water usage is high. In many parts of the developing world, the biggest source of water waste is leakage from pipes. Deploying sensors and analytics can cut those losses by up to 25 percent. Applications such as pay-as-you-throw digital tracking can reduce the volume of solid waste per capita by 10 to 20 percent. Overall, cities can save 25 to 80 liters of water per person each day and reduce unrecycled solid waste by 30 to 130 kilograms per person annually.
Air-quality sensors do not automatically address the causes of pollution, but they can identify the sources and provide the basis for further action. Beijing reduced deadly airborne pollutants by roughly 20 percent in less than a year by closely tracking the sources of pollution and regulating traffic and construction accordingly. Sharing real-time air-quality information with the public via smartphone apps enables individuals to take protective measures. This can reduce negative health effects by 3 to 15 percent, depending on current pollution levels.
Smart cities can create a new type of digital urban commons and enhance social connectedness
Community is hard to quantify, but MGI surveyed urban residents to determine if digital channels for communicating with local officials as well as digital platforms that facilitate real-world interactions (such as Meetup and Nextdoor) can have an impact. Our analysis suggests that using these types of applications could nearly double the share of residents who feel connected to the local community, and nearly triple the share who feel connected to local government.
Establishing channels for two-way communication between the public and local agencies could make city governments more responsive. Many city agencies maintain an active presence on social networks, and others have developed their own interactive citizen apps. In addition to disseminating information, these channels create vehicles for residents to report concerns, collect data, or weigh in on planning issues. Paris has implemented a participatory budget, inviting anyone to post project ideas and then holding online votes to decide which ones merit funding.

Becoming a smart city is not a strategy for job creation, but smart solutions can make local labor markets more efficient and slightly lower the cost of living

Many local officials want to know if becoming a smart city will lead to an infusion of high-paying tech jobs or accelerate a wave of automation. Our analysis finds a slightly positive net impact on formal employment. Smart technologies will directly eliminate some jobs (such as administrative and field jobs in city government) while creating others (such as maintenance, driving roles, and temporary installation jobs). E-career centers can have a modest positive impact by creating more efficient mechanisms for hiring and drawing more unemployed and inactive people into the workforce. Data-driven formal education and online retraining programs can enhance a city’s pool of skills. Digitizing government functions such as business licensing, permitting, and tax filing can free local enterprises from red tape, contributing to a more entrepreneurial business climate.
Many of the world’s most dynamic and desirable cities have serious housing shortages, driving up rents and home prices. Expanding the supply of housing can bring down those costs. In many places, bureaucracy bogs down land acquisition, environmental studies, design approvals, and permitting. Digitizing these processes can remove risks and delays, encouraging more construction. In addition, most cities have a surprising amount of land sitting idle that could be suitable for infill housing. Creating open-source cadastral databases can help to identify land parcels for development.
Smart applications produce savings in other areas, such as encouraging more efficient usage of utilities and the healthcare system. Products such as home-security systems, personal-alert devices, and lifestyle wearables involve consumer purchases, but they offer value that many are willing to pay for. Mobility applications offer new value as well, although e-hailing may encourage people to take more rides than they once did. However, e-hailing and other sharing applications make it possible for some people to forgo private vehicle ownership. MGI estimates that the average person could save as much as 3 percent on current annual expenditures.
 

A look at current deployment in 50 cities around the world shows that even the most advanced still have a long way to go
MGI took a snapshot of deployment in 50 cities around the world, not to crown the world’s smartest city but to show the full sweep of activity under way around the globe. This includes assessment of each city’s technology base, its current application rollout, and public adoption.

Our view of each city’s technology base looked at the extent of sensors and devices, the quality of communication networks, and the presence of open data portals. Among the most advanced are Amsterdam, New York, Seoul, Singapore, and Stockholm—but even these front-runners are only about two-thirds of the way toward what constitutes a fully comprehensive technology base today. In general, cities across China, East Asia, Europe, and North America have relatively strong tech bases, as do select cities in the Middle East. But those in Africa, India, and Latin America lag behind, particularly in installing the sensor layer, the most capital-intensive element.
We gauged each city’s progress in implementation using a checklist of current smart applications. Mobility has been a top priority for most cities, but those places with the highest number of applications implemented overall—London, Los Angeles, New York, Seoul, Shenzhen, and Singapore—have branched out into multiple domains. Some cities have not yet implemented the applications with the greatest potential to address some of their priority issues.
MGI conducted online surveys in all of the cities analyzed to gauge how residents feel about the technologies already at work in their environment. We found that Asian cities are the strongest performers in awareness, usage, and satisfaction, while European cities lag. Positive adoption and awareness appear correlated with having a young population that not only accepts a more digital way of doing things but also expects it.
 

Smart cities change the economics of infrastructure and create room for partnerships and private-sector participation
Smart-city technologies help cities get more out of their assets, whether they have extensive legacy systems or are building from scratch. There is no getting around the need to invest in physical assets and maintenance, but smart technologies can add new capabilities as core components are upgraded.
Infrastructure investment once locked cities into capital-intensive and extremely long-term plans. Now, using the right combination of traditional construction and smart solutions, they can respond more dynamically to how demand is changing. If population growth surges in a far-flung neighborhood, adding a new subway or bus line with the accompanying fleet expansion may take years. By contrast, a privately operated on-demand minibus service could be up and running much faster.

City government does not have to be the sole funder and operator of every type of service and infrastructure system. While implementing most of the applications that we examined would fall to the public sector, the majority of the initial investment could come from private actors (Exhibit 2). Public financing may be reserved for only those public goods that must be provided by the government. Furthermore, more than half of the initial investment that needs to be made by the public sector would generate a positive financial return, which opens the door to partnerships.

Exhibit 2


Adding more actors to the mix is a positive, since it increases adoption and applies more creativity to the available data. When private-sector innovations spring up organically, the role of government may involve regulating, convening key actors, offering subsidies, or changing purchasing decisions. Rather than taking a master-planning approach, some cities position themselves as ecosystems, creating consortia and even physical collaboration spaces.

Some cities are starting their transformations with inherent advantages such as wealth, density, and existing high-tech industries. But even places that lack these ingredients can set themselves apart with vision, good management, a willingness to break with conventional ways of doing things, and a relentless commitment to meeting the needs of residents. There are many blank canvases for the private sector, not for profits, and technologists to fill—and above all, individuals should be empowered to shape the future of the cities they call home.

This, a first for Morocco, is on offer in Casablanca from the startup Carmine. Now that self-service bikes have rolled into the country, cars are following suit and offer a much-wanted service in the economic capital, burdened with increasing, chaotic traffic.
The firm was created in 2014, and tested the waters with a pilot project in July 2015. According to CEO and founder Mohamed Mrani Alaoui, this was, “A period during which we really reached maturity.”
There was a lot to do: running trials on rates, defining parking spaces through a partnership with the city, personalising technology and getting to know client needs.
“People thought the concept wouldn’t work in Morocco, to judge by the time it took us to go into commercial operation,” says Alaoui. “But that pilot period was about making the new service more effective. And then, the hardest part was to find funding. I started out alone with my own savings and we were extra careful until we found investors.”
The deal was finalised when former minister of transportation Karim Ghellab signed up to the venture as an associate through his investment fund Massir Invest. This is the kind of backing that enabled the effective launch of Carmine in mid-October 2017.
Given the nature of the business, explains Aloui, it’s necessary to juggle between the investor who is advancing the working capital, the leasing companies that finance the vehicles, and the bank. “Bringing these three parties together is very difficult,” he says.
Now, the startup can follow its ambitions. To gauge the quality of the service, Carmine must take into account a sample of 40 individual users per shared vehicle; 3,600 users in total for the 120 expected vehicles over a span of four years.
Rates start at Dh30 ($3) per hour plus Dh1 per kilometre, with a subscription ranging between Dh290 for a quarter and Dh890 for a full year – fuel, insurance, and parking included.
Corporate philosophy
Carmine’s corporate philosophy is about more than just offering vehicles and the founder is committed to working towards safer driving habits. In Carmine’s fleet of vehicles in-car technology saves all information related to clients’ driving, be it accelerations or decelerations, turns, speed, etc.

When the vehicle runs at 80km/hr on a road where the limit is 60, the company is sent a warning.
This information, which remains confidential, is then turned into grades.
A client who gets less than seven out of 10 is given a period of time to improve should they wish to retain their membership. And the other way around: people scoring more than nine out of 10 benefit from special offers. “This is our way of encouraging people to be careful on the road,” the CEO said.
Having trained in actuarial methods in Montreal, then in San Francisco, Alaoui has always seen himself as an entrepreneur.
The idea of a shared car service came to him upon his return to Morocco. “I didn’t have a car when I got back to Casablanca. Coming back from the USA, where such services are widespread, while here nothing of this sort was in place, I set myself to work.”
The typical clientele interested in Alaoui’s service ranges from young professionals such as himself to people in transit, families or companies in occasional need of a main or secondary vehicle and university students.
This is a car-sharing service totally suited to the collaborative economy, as is becoming more and more widespread throughout the world.

Asia’s major cities, and their hi-tech-savvy younger generation, are poised to play a more crucial future role in making urban life easier through the use of smart technology, a new McKinsey report predicts.
The report measures “smartness” by the adoption levels of technology-led infrastructure, the availability of smart applications and urban residents’ embracing of such offerings, spanning from real-time public transit information to tele-medicine, or remote diagnosis of diseases.

New York, Singapore and San Francisco are still the global top three performers – but they are closely followed and being caught up quickly by mainland China cities Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai, and the South Korean capital Seoul, where the McKinsey study says increasing numbers of Asian residents are already embracing big data and the very latest in technology.
The McKinsey Global Institute, the consultancy’s research arm, measured 50 major cities around the world on their smart progress so far.
“The fortunes of the emerging economies will be shaped by what happens in their cities – and Asia, with its young population of digital natives and biggest urban problems to solve, appears poised to carry the torch for the smart-city movement in future,” the McKinsey study concludes.


The world’s most-developed cities still lead in building the underlying information technology infrastructure, including sensors and devices to obtain data, fast communications networks and open data portals for government agencies to better share data with the public, with those in North America also lead the way in the roll-out of smart applications.
This strength of high-income cities, however, is not necessarily working in tandem with their residents’ adoption of smart applications, especially in cities populated by the elderly citizens, said Katrina Lv, a McKinsey partner in Shanghai, stressing that Chinese cities are already moving ahead of the curve in “going smart”, compared with some of their western counterparts.
“With its big urban problems to solve, China and the whole Asian region will play a big role in shaping the future of smart cities,” said Lv.
The study said that Asia’s next generation or professionals are not only more accepting of doing things the digital way, but have come to expect it and already demand a seamless experience.
Those top Chinese cities excel, it adds, in the levels of acceptance of adopting smart city applications.
It also says as cities become smarter, there will be some fundamental shifts in a raft of traditional industries, using the real estate sector as a typical example.
The study showed land values, for instance, are likely to rise in previously less popular areas of some cities, as they become smarter.
Smart mobility applications such as e-hailing, on-demand minibuses, and eventually autonomous cars could raise values in areas that are not currently well served by conventional forms of public transport.
The study predicts, too, that better use of data and technology could shave 15 to 30 minutes off average daily commuting times, or save up to 300 lives annually, in a city with a population of 5 million. — South China Morning Post

A new competitor wants in on Seattle’s hypercompetitive, polychromatic bike-share landscape. Uber, the ride-hailing behemoth, plans to launch with its newly acquired, bright-red JUMP electric bikes.
Uber bought JUMP, a bike-share startup, for an undisclosed amount in a deal that was announced in April, but finalized within the last month. The company is waiting for Seattle to set up a permanent bike-share permit program before it commits to the city.
“We’ll make a decision to apply for a permit once we see the regulations,” Nathan Hambley, an Uber spokesman, said. “We do hope to launch in Seattle.”

The Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) has been working on finalizing a permit program for bike-share operators for most of this year. In a process that has been repeatedly pushed back, SDOT says the plan is to present a proposal to the City Council in July.
The three bike-share companies currently operating in Seattle are on one-year permits that expire in July.
Those companies have operated with nearly free rein on city streets — paying only minimal fees — in exchange for giving a wide range of data to the city. They’ve turned over the kind of usage and ridership data that Uber has long fought, and continues to fight, to keep secret in its ride-hailing business.

The arrival of JUMP, backed by Uber, would heighten the competition among the companies that’s brought 10,000 bikes, available for low-cost rental, scattered in nearly all corners of the city.
 “We’re committed to bringing together multiple modes of transportation within the Uber app,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said when the JUMP purchase was announced. “So that you can choose the fastest or most affordable way to get where you’re going, whether that’s in an Uber, on a bike, on the subway or more.”

JUMP recently wrote to SDOT and the City Council urging them to adopt policies — prioritizing e-bikes and requiring bikes to be locked to a physical object — that would favor them over the other companies.
The red bikes — which along with orange Spin bikes, yellow ofo bikes and green Lime bikes would cover Seattle streets with a majority of the ROY G BIV color spectrum — are different from the others in a couple of significant ways.


 Like the bike shares already here, the JUMP bikes have no stations and can be left pretty much anywhere. But unlike the other bikes, JUMP bikes do not lock to themselves, they’re meant to be locked to something when not in use, ideally a regular bike rack.


Spin, ofo and Lime bikes all lock with a mechanism that goes through the rear wheel

On a JUMP bike, a U-shaped piece of metal detaches from the bike and then locks the bike to a bike rack or other object. When you’re riding, the lock slides into a slot on the rear wheel.
That could be a partial solution to the most vocal complaints about Seattle’s bike-share experiment to date — bikes parked haphazardly, blocking sidewalks and businesses.

Mafara Hobson, an SDOT spokeswoman, said the city’s forthcoming regulations will try to address that issue.
“SDOT recommends a strong proactive approach to manage bike-share parking, ensuring that the companies keep sidewalks, curb ramps and transit access clear,” Hobson said.
She said the agency’s regulations — which will need City Council approval — would also likely raise fees on the companies and focus on equitable access in all neighborhoods.
The other major difference is that the JUMP bikes are unlocked by typing in a personal ID number and pass code, rather than by scanning with a smartphone app. This, conceivably, could make the bikes more accessible to people without a smartphone, although an app is still used to find bikes on a map and to sign up for the service.
The bikes, which are operating in San Francisco; Washington, D.C.; Sacramento; and Santa Cruz, can be accessed via the JUMP app or the Uber app.
JUMP says the bikes also can be unlocked with an ORCA card, although you would still pay with a linked credit card, not with the ORCA card.

The e-bikes are electric assisted — you still need to pedal, but an electric motor (capped at 20 miles per hour) kicks in to help you, especially on hills.
At $2 per 30 minutes, they’re more expensive than the nonelectric bikes available in the city, but a little cheaper than Lime’s e-bikes.

US-based ride-hailing service Uber Technologies Inc yesterday announced partnerships with three small-scale Taipei taxi operators to set up its UberTaxi service, in its latest efforts to secure a licensed operation.
Uber Taiwan, a local arm of Uber Technologies, is transforming itself into a taxi-hailing platform from a vehicle-sharing service by collaborating with licensed cab drivers, as it faces mounting pressure from local regulators to exit Taiwan.
Since making a comeback in mid-April, Uber Taiwan has teamed up with more than 100 local car rental companies, which provide licensed drivers and cars.
“We do this in complete cooperation and working with local governments,” said Brooks Entwistle, the firm’s new chief business officer for the Asia-Pacific region, at a news conference in Taipei.
“This is what we want to do and what we are doing going forward.”
Uber has launched its UberTaxi service in Myanmar, Malaysia and Sydney, Entwistle said.
Entwistle said the company could help boost earnings for local taxi drivers through its app.

There are 30,000 registered taxi drivers in Taipei, who operate at a 30 percent utilization rate, meaning they spend most of the time driving around the city looking for passengers, Entwistle said, citing an unspecified survey.
“The 30 percent of utilization is a number we can do a lot on [the] Uber platform to increase dramatically,” Entwistle said.
Starting today, the company’s ride-hailing app allows users to arrange and schedule transportation and logistics services with third parties.
The San Fransisco-based company said it is providing its app to Crown Taxi (皇冠大車隊), Asia Pacific Satellite Taxi Co (亞太衛星車隊) and QTaxi, a new entrant to the market.
While the business model remains the same, a major change is that passengers using the new service are to pay according to the taxi meter, rather than by credit card or other digital payment systems at a price calculated by Uber.
During the initial stage of about three months, Uber is to offer the taxi operators free use of its platform, the company said, adding that it did not rule out offering similar services in other cities.
“We do not see Uber as a competitor — we are cooperating with each other,” Asia Pacific Satellite Taxi president Chen Shin-chun (陳新鈞) told reporters.
“The cooperation means a lot for a small-scale fleet like us, as we could save the NT$3 million to NT$4 million [US$99,321 to US$132,428] it would cost build our own app.”
“Taiwan’s taxi-hailing industry is too traditional. We need to make a change to survive,” Chen said.
Taxi drivers are only making half the income they used to earn 30 years ago, as the high-speed railway and the Mass Rapid Transit system have taken a toll on the business, Chen said, adding that about one-third of Asia Pacific Satellite’s drivers have joined the program.

FORGET high-speed rail, Uber thinks it holds the futuristic key to freeing up the clogged roads which plague our big cities.

As the California giant’s boffins touch down in Australia to woo pollies, transport authorities and property developers, the company has announced its ambitious UberAIR program could be tested here by 2020.
If it all goes to plan, passengers might be able to share short, cheap flights using Uber’s “flying cars” by 2023. It is believed the futuristic method of transport could massively slash travel times.
Uber has even identified possible routes for its aircraft, showing a two-hour trip by car in Sydney, for example, could become a 20-minute trip by UberAIR.

“Every day, millions of hours are wasted on the road worldwide,” a Uber spokesman said in its mission statement for UberAIR.
“In Sydney, residents spend seven whole working weeks each year commuting, two of which are wasted unproductively stuck in gridlock.
“On-demand aviation has the potential to radically improve urban mobility, giving people back time lost in their daily commutes. Uber is close to the commute pain that citizens in cities around the world feel.”
And, as if tensions between Melbourne and Sydney weren’t bad enough, Uber is pitting the two against each other to become the first Aussie city to host the ambitious project.
“Dallas and Los Angeles were previously announced as the first two launch cities, and we are now seeking an international city as the third partner,” an Uber spokesman added.

If either Sydney or Melbourne is successful, the tech giant would work with local developers to build up to 25 “Skyports” in and around the city for landing and launching aircraft.
The idea is very similar to the current Uber format. Smartphone users will be able to request a ride using an app, catch a car to a Skyport, board an UberAir vehicle and another car from their landing point to their final destination.
And, Uber’s engineering director of aviation, Mark Moore, told FlightGlobal that established helicopter routes above cities will make travelling by air over short distances far safer than it is today.

“One of the reasons why helicopter safety is not as good as other [aircraft] safety is because there is a high degree of operational uncertainty,” he said.
“We have a huge operational advantage in terms of safety where we are always repeating the same thing — a trip from a sky port to a sky port. The geography is well known; the structures are well known; the support and sky port is known, and part of our integrated network structure.”
Uber is scheduled to announce the successful candidate city before the end of the year.

Carmakers’ good days will soon be gone as their margins are narrowing while the ownership of data is predicted to become the future source of profits.

Global industry insiders foresee car users in the future not having to own a vehicle, since the younger generations, especially those from China, have a greater chance of using shared mobility services than owning a vehicle.


One day, major new car demands will come from car-sharing companies and mobility service providers.As a result, original equipment makers will be selling non-brand chassis, and automotive companies will have to be flexible on their future business models, according to the world’s automotive leaders.
The future of the automobile industry was discussed at the Global Automotive Forum on Thursday.
The forum has been held annually for eight straight years since 2010 by an automotive committee under the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. This is the third consecutive time the forum was hosted in Southwest China’s Chongqing.
“On-demand intelligent driving in the future smart city will provide immense business opportunities,” said Matthew Kardel, managing director of automated driving at Delphi Corp.
Vehicles are becoming more and more intelligent and connected, so use of vehicles is going to generate large amount of data that could be monetized, according to Kardel. Estimates show that a vehicle could generate 2 to 4 terabytes data per hour when in service.
“Data is the new oil, from an aggressive perspective,” Kardel said.
While big data generated by use of vehicles has burgeoned in recent years, the possible data owners－not only the automakers, but also the suppliers－are joining the game.
Kurt Lehmann, chief technology officer of Continental AG, said: “Vehicles are more and more connected. They have to be more flexible and adjust themselves according to the disruptive environment.”
He recommended that manufacturers have an open mind on what the data means, and the benefits from big data will be enjoyed when players in varied fields collaborate.
The technology leaders of Continental and Delphi told the forum they are both eyeing the possibility of monetizing the data, despite the varied directions of partnerships.
The British automotive supplier, Delphi, announced in May that it would join BMW, Intel and Mobileye as a development partner and system integrator for their autonomous driving platform.
The four partners intend to deploy a cooperation model to deliver and scale solutions to the automotive industry and potentially other industries.
Continental, a German technology company, announced on June 1 its strategic cooperation agreement with Baidu Inc, one of the biggest dotcom companies in China, to work on autonomous driving and connected vehicles.
The two companies will explore collaboration in the fields of sensor systems and software for advanced driver assistance systems and automated driving.
One possible threat to the monetization of data lies in privacy and security, warned a senior executive at a consulting firm.
“The carmakers, suppliers, government bodies and car users own a fraction of the data, which they need to share among each other. So protecting data privacy and security and complying with local legislation will be the key to the business.”

The technology underpinning the cryptocurrency bitcoin is migrating to the auto industry and vehicle sharing.
Accounting and consulting firm EY, part of Ernst & Young Global Ltd, said it was launching a blockchain based system that will enable companies or groups of individuals to more easily share ownership of vehicles and access to cars and trucks.
“The time has come for to reshape the automotive industry,” said EY Global Innovation Leader Paul Brody.

In an interview with Reuters, EY partner John Simlett said blockchain can also be used to share ownership of big fleets of cars and trucks, such as vehicles that are parked in an apartment building but aren’t being used.
The idea would be that customers can access the cars via a smartphone app, noted the report.
Toyota, EY, IBM and Microsoft have established differents kinds of parnertships in order to study how blockchain systems could shake up the auto industry.

Cleaner, Faster, Greener, and Cheaper: over the past century, fossil-fuel powered automobiles have become the default transportation mode across the industrialized world, impacting everything from patterns of land use to foreign policy.

And while the dominance of cars has certainly had beneficial effects, it’s also taken a heavy toll in pollution, resource consumption and a range of social and public health ills.
A recent report from the University of California Davis envisions a future in which how we get around each day becomes cleaner, faster, greener .. and cheaper by combining three emerging technologies.
The study suggests this sustainable transportation future will exist at the intersection of what lead author Lew Fulton calls three revolutions that are already underway. Number one, he says …

“Vehicle electrification. The second is automated vehicles leading in increments to a driverless car, and the third one is shared mobility, you don’t need to have your own car anymore.”

Fulton is with the Sustainable Transportation Energy Pathways program at UC Davis. He notes there are already about three million electric vehicles on the world’s roads. And last year, US sales of EVs shot up nearly 40 percent.
Study co-author Jacob Mason is with the non-profit Institute for Transportation and Development Policy. He says electric cars are a key part of the green transportation vision.

“Vehicle electrification significantly reduces local air pollution,” he says. “And if you couple that with sustainable electricity generation, then you can get rid of a lot of fossil fuel and greenhouse gas emissions.”

Lew Fulton says driverless cars – which just a few years ago seemed like science fiction – are definitely on the way.

“Technologically, it’s moved really quickly, and the cost of building these vehicles has come down a lot.”

Recently, Apple became the latest tech giant to follow Google, Tesla and Uber – as well as automakers including Ford, Honda and Volkswagen – in the race to perfect the autonomous vehicle. If successful, that could not only eliminate most car accidents; a system of wirelessly-connected autonomous cars could sharply reduce congestion by more efficiently managing traffic flow.
Then Fulton says, there’s that “shared mobility” business …

“It’s the idea that we would no longer own cars. We would simply hail them, call them, when we need them.”

So when you weave these technologies together, you get something like this …
Every morning when you’re ready to go to work, you use a smartphone app to summon an electric-powered, driverless van. You and several other commuters from your neighborhood work on your laptops or browse the news on your tablets till you arrive at your office.
It’s like Uber with robots.
Compare that to the way we do things now. We pay tens of thousands of dollars for a car that sits parked most of the time, then pay hundreds more each month for insurance, maintenance, repair, gas, parking. Lew Fulton says that just won’t make sense any more.

“If instead of that model, we have a model where we’re paying a little more for each trip and we don’t have the expense of owning a car, it comes out much, much cheaper,” he says.

Jacob Mason says that shift could have profound implications for urban quality of life.

“Curbside parking, parking garages, parking lots … All of a sudden that space is … the need for it for parking is reduced and so that could become more public space, more housing, parks, what have you.”

Jeff Allen heads a Portland-based group called Forth. It’s a trade association and advocacy group to support electric vehicles and what’s called “advanced mobility.” Allen’s group is all on board with these three transportation revolutions.
But, like the authors of the UC Davis study, Allen knows the convergence of these technologies could have a dark side.

“Just because they’re disruptive doesn’t mean that they’re good,” he says. “They could be disruptive in ways that most of us wouldn’t like.”

For example, Allen says, new technologies tend to gravitate toward the markets that are most profitable. But many of these innovations would greatly benefit underserved communities, as well.

“Our job, then, is to figure out how do you point those technologies in the right direction socially? And then also, how do you hack them for the benefit of people who really need them?”

Study authors Lew Fulton and Jacob Mason readily admit there’s a slew of barriers to be overcome and unintended bad outcomes to be avoided in pursuit of this green transportation utopia.
But, they say, the potential is there, if we play our cards right, for these technologies to free up time, space and money to make getting around more efficient, more pleasant and way easier on the planet.

BMW’s ReachNow car-sharing service is partnering with a luxury apartment building in downtown Seattle to offer dedicated vehicles for residents.
It’s an expansion of ReachNow’s free-floating car-sharing service in Seattle, where customers can rent BMW-owned vehicles and park them on any city street inside the “Home Area.”
ReachNow will initially provide two dedicated cars to residents at West Edge. Vehicles must be returned to the apartment building after each trip. ReachNow charges by the minute, hour, or day. It lets users to park during a reservation, allowing for a roundtrip to the grocery store or a weekend-long getaway, for example.
Residents will still be responsible for paying for their own trips. The idea for West Edge is to provide easy access to car-sharing in the city.
“West Edge was designed to embrace sophisticated urban living,” Greg Smith, CEO at real estate development firm Urban Visions, said in a statement. “Part of that reality is that not every resident needs or wants their own vehicle; our partnership with ReachNow allows us to add flexibility for our residents and enhance the experience of living downtown.”
ReachNow has similar deals with residential buildings in New York City, where it recently shut down its free-floating service.
It’s part of ReachNow’s attempt at growing beyond the traditional free-floating model. ReachNow last year launched its first “corporate fleet” at the 8th and Olive office building, giving employees exclusive access to an on-demand fleet of vehicles. But it shut that program down months later, partly because the vehicles were required to be driven back to the building if an employee rented a car from the dedicated fleet and took a trip.
“The round-trip model didn’t make sense for them,” ReachNow CEO Steve Banfield told GeekWire in June 2017.
Earlier this year Reach Now partnered with Intel in Portland to offer dedicated vehicles for employees.
ReachNow now has more than 85,000 members in Seattle, Portland, and New York City, operating a 1,300-vehicle fleet across the three cities. It competes with car2go and other alternative transportation options like Uber and Lyft. All are apart of a trend toward decreasing car ownership in the U.S. as more tech-fueled services, from ride-hailing to scooters to the Airbnb for rental cars, offer city dwellers more transportation flexibility.
“Car ownership, for a long time, has symbolized freedom and independence,” wrote The Wall Street Journal last year. “But in the future, it may be akin to owning a horse today — a rare luxury.”

Three transportation revolutions are in sight, and together, they could help reduce traffic, improve livability, eventually save trillions of dollars each year, and reduce urban transportation carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent or more worldwide by 2050.
That’s according to a report released today from the University of California, Davis, and the New York-based nonprofit Institute for Transportation & Development Policy.
But to receive the most benefit from these revolutions, the report says the most critical component is something most preschoolers know: Sharing is caring.
Share the ride
The report delves into three urban travel scenarios surrounding three transportation “revolutions”: vehicle electrification, automation, and widespread shared mobility — which moves beyond single-occupant ride hailing.
The scenarios include:

Business as usual: a future without widespread electrification or automation
“2 Revolutions”: electrification and automation are embraced but shared mobility is not
“3 Revolutions”: electrification, automation and shared mobility are all widespread

The report determined that shared mobility is the third and vital piece that could move global transportation into a future that not only saves energy and emissions but also decongests highways, frees up parking lots for other urban uses, cuts transportation costs, and improves walkability and livability.
“When it comes to cars, what we learned early in life still holds true — sharing makes everything better,” said lead author Lewis Fulton, a co-director at the Sustainable Transportation Energy Pathways, or STEPS, program of the UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies. “All the futuristic automotive technology being developed could make our cities more livable and the air more breathable — but only if we take sharing seriously.”
Shared mobility includes ride-hailing services, but only when carrying multiple occupants. It also includes new forms of on-demand public transportation, such as small commuter buses with flexible routes. Active transportation, such as cycling, complements this scenario.
Benefits worldwide
The report spans eight global regions, including five major markets: United States, Europe, China, India and Brazil.
The different global regions vary considerably in their starting points. For example, the United States is highly car-dependent, whereas India’s challenge will be to preserve and enhance shared mobility options they already have. Yet, across the globe, the researchers found the 3 Revolutions, or 3R, scenario to hold the most environmental and societal benefit.
Potential pitfalls of not sharing
Without a concurrent shift away from private vehicle ownership and toward ride sharing, the potential for electric, autonomous vehicles to reduce traffic and sprawl are severely limited, and CO2 reductions will be significantly less than with sharing, the report says.
Electrified, driverless vehicles alone could actually increase traffic congestion. Imagine people spending even more time in their cars or the possibility of zero-occupant, driverless vehicles continuously circling the streets rather than parking.

Electrification is also very important. The report estimates that an autonomous vehicle world without electrification or trip sharing would not cut carbon dioxide emissions at all, and might increase vehicle travel by 15 to 20 percent.
“The findings point out that urban transportation has to evolve beyond single-occupancy vehicles and a single HOV lane,” said Jacob Mason, transport research and evaluation manager at ITDP. “If passenger vehicles do not become predominantly shared by 2050, our cities will continue to be choked by congestion, and defined by sprawling land development and the massive emissions this system generates.
Instead, the urban residents of tomorrow should ride electric, automated, and shared vehicles into a cleaner and healthier future.”
The road to achieving emissions targets
The report, “Three Revolutions in Urban Transportation,” comes the week before an international climate change meeting begins in Bonn, Germany. The climate talks will focus on implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement, which targets a 2 degree Celsius or lower cap to an overall temperature change from global warming. This target requires all nations to cut their carbon dioxide emissions dramatically by 2050. The authors note that the “3R” scenario would meet that benchmark for cities, and possibly go further.
The authors recognize that bringing about these revolutions won’t be easy. The report outlines needed policies, and says unprecedented levels of policy support and coordination are needed at the local, state and national levels.
The report assesses policies including those that incentivize widespread adoption of electric and driverless cars, as well as support for ride sharing, public and active transport, and land-use planning that helps shorten most vehicle trips.
Such policies could consider fees tied to vehicle CO2 emissions, vehicle occupancy, and possible restrictions or heavy charges on private ownership of autonomous vehicles, along with strong disincentives for zero-occupant trips. Bicycle and e-bike sharing systems also need to be encouraged along with transit system innovations.
The report was funded by ClimateWorks Foundation, William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and Barr Foundation.

If you’re part of the 95% of Americans who own a smartphone today, what’s the most important thing you look for when upgrading your device? A better camera? Lots of storage? Whatever it is, it likely has more to do with internet capabilities or features than it does with the actual phone itself. But the phone industry hasn’t always been like this.

In the early 2000s, phones were just that – phones. As consumers, we cared about the form-factor of the hardware (and maybe the carrier depending on the cell coverage). Remember the first Motorola RAZR, the thinnest, must-have flip phone you could buy in 2004? Hardware vendors Nokia and Motorola were poised to be giants of the cell phone industry.
Then – seemingly overnight – came a revolution. Apple’s Steve Jobs looked at a phone as a pocketable PC as opposed to a device that primarily made phone calls. This “pocketable PC” idea revolutionized the entire consumer technology space and made smartphones the must-have device for billions of people worldwide.

Today, the auto industry is poised to follow suit, with technology driving vehicle innovation and customer purchasing behavior. Historically, consumers looking to purchase a vehicle have focused on the “hardware” – the look, comfort, horsepower and fuel efficiency.
But, as the playing field has leveled on these elements, automakers have raced to offer the latest technologies, from GPS to Bluetooth, lane sensors and assisted parking to full-blown autonomy.
Today, many auto buyers want seamless smartphone integration as part of the driving experience and will not purchase cars that do not accommodate their smartphones. This is a huge shift from the era when design, reliability and horsepower were the main buying criteria.
Electric vehicles have also arrived and these new EVs are very different from their internal combustion engine predecessors: they are far less complex, far longer lived and contain a vast amount of software.
These simultaneous massive shifts have opened the door for tech companies to become major players in what feels like a brand new industry of technology-rich EVs. To remain successful, automakers can look to the phone industry of the late 2000s to understand why this shift is taking place and how they can capitalize on it for themselves.
Why is this shift happening?
At the basic level, this shift has been led by the two main market needs: the need to be constantly connected and the need to have more reliable, greener transportation. Just like smartphones, cars are incredibly personal objects – we live with and love our cars and spend a lot of time in them, which means we want our entertainment, work, news and beyond to follow us seamlessly from the cloud to the car.
The car cannot be a dead zone – people want all the comforts of home and the access of the workplace. Connecting the car has become an imperative, and most cars today have multiple wireless connections ranging from cellular to WiFi to Bluetooth.
At the same time, it’s hard to miss the massive shift happening with the move to electrification. While the desire to reduce pollution has been an important factor, especially at the government level, electrification makes for drastically simpler cars and makes EVs far more reliable and long-lived. These three factors (government mandates, reliability and longer lifespan) have ensured that every carmaker must move to EVs.
In parallel with electrification has been the rise of sophisticated semi-autonomous driving features. These safety features use LIDAR, RADAR and many other sophisticated technologies to make cars dramatically safer.
The confluence of these three trends – electrification, connectivity and autonomy – will shape the future of the automotive market. Every car will become an EV, all EVs will be connected and all EVs will end up becoming more and more autonomous. It’s a revolution much like when phones morphed into smartphones. All phones gradually became smarter until smartphones totally dominated the market.
What technology is making this possible?
A major difference between the original mobile phones and today’s smartphones is the use of sophisticated sensors and powerful supercomputer class processors, which give your iPhone or Android the power to give you directions, send messages and run a multitude of apps. Just like smartphones, today’s cars are chock-full of these sensors and processors, creating a kind of ambient intelligence cloud throughout the vehicle.
Now, this technology is used to enable Bluetooth, backup cameras and automatic parallel parking capabilities, but as these sensors continue to become more sophisticated, the technical capabilities of vehicles are nearly limitless, making it possible for EVs to eventually become fully autonomous.

On the electrification side, battery technology is now sufficient enough to match internal combustion car range, meaning that more reliable, simpler EVs are now a practical choice. Wireless charging will soon make charging easier than refueling, which makes for a very smooth user experience.
How can this happen in the auto industry?
Just as the mobile phone supply chain was once very monolithic, so too is today’s automotive supply chain. As mobile phones morphed into smartphones, they started to incorporate technology from various suppliers in a modular fashion.
Traditionally, the automotive supply chain has been controlled by a series of Tier 1 suppliers that work directly with automakers. Tier 1 suppliers have been gatekeepers for new technology to be incorporated into vehicles, often acting as the middleman between companies developing these technologies and the automakers themselves.
However, with the advent of electrification and autonomy technology, the traditional automotive supply chain simply could not provide adequate solutions, opening the door for leading technology providers to work directly with automakers.
Since they are working with many automakers, new tech suppliers have had to create modular sub-assemblies (e.g. a wireless charging receiver assembly) and software packages. This has created a more modularized automotive supply chain – a dramatic shift.
To remain competitive, automakers need to embrace this shift fully, closely monitoring the emerging vehicle technology space and working with technology providers to stay ahead of the curve. In this new supply chain, technology providers will gain power, and those with the best solutions will have the ability to choose the partner making them the best offer.
Just as the smartphone revolutionized the phone industry, electrification and autonomy are creating an automotive revolution that will change the way we move around the world. To make this a reality, automakers must commit to being more agile – the technology industry moves at a breakneck pace, and automakers need to be willing to speed up their processes or risk losing out on the next great opportunity.

Most of us know there is often a chasm that exists between theory and reality.
Many companies expect to make a lot of money from ride hailing and ride sharing services in the future.
Legacy automakers are tripping all over themselves to get into the self driving car business so they can cash in on the next boom market.
But what no one seems to be taking into consideration is the cost of cleaning all those vehicles after the trip is over.

If you see a newspaper fluttering across your lawn, you pick it up because it is on your property.
If you see a newspaper fluttering across a public park, you watch is go by and move on. That’s just human nature.
One of the great criticism of communism is that everybody’s property is nobody’s property and becomes neglected.
A self driving car that belongs to no one will suffer the same lack of care.
Pritam Singh is a driver for Lyft. He says he spends about $200 a month cleaning his Toyota Camry to get rid of vomit, greasy fingerprints, dog excrement on floor mats, and other gross and disgusting things he says come with the territory.
That’s a lot of money for one person to spend when the typical fare nets just $10 or so.
Uber and Lyft assume that apps and bots will take care of running operations while they sit back and rake in the cash.
In actuality, there are several hidden costs that need to be taken into account when calculating the bottom line. Hertz has recently reported huge losses because prices for used sedans are plummeting in a world where everyone wants an SUV.
Paying for places to park a fleet of cars in congested cities can cost big dollars.
Then there is insurance, property taxes, and all the other little niggling charges that can quickly eat into gross income. Depreciation is also a big factor.
Hertz must deal with average depreciation of $300 a month on its rental car fleet. Taken together, all those expenses could total billions of dollars a year. “It is a really big issue and no one has figured it out,” says Mark Wakefield, co-head of automotive practices at consulting firm AlixPartners. “No one is even betting on the outcome.”
Still, Wakefield is bullish on the future of self driving cars. In theory, they could free up acres of valuable real estate in cities.
Instead of being used for parking individual cars, that land could be used for parks, recreational facilities, or bicycle lanes.
Proponents believe garages on private homes and in apartment buildings could become redundant.
Freeing people from paying car loans, insurance bills, repair costs, and gasoline expenses would put thousands of dollars a year back in their wallets — money that could be spent to hire a vehicle when needed.
John Zimmer, co-founder of Lyft, describes a private automobile as “a ball and chain that gets dragged through our daily life.” He predicts private car ownership will “all but end” in major U.S. cities by 2025.
AlixPartners’ Wakefield says ride sharing services could fundamentally change how people view and buy transportation. But first, someone has to figure out how to keep all those cars clean.
Perhaps the people who really profit from the self driving car revolution are the ones who create companies to service the needs of the car sharing industry.
In the meantime, ride share drivers like Pritar Singh have advice for others who are new to the business — and robocar operators of the future.
Stay off the roads after the bars close and carry barf bags to limit vomit problems.
Reduce sticky fingerprints by avoiding anyone carrying a bag from a fast food restaurant.
In theory, robots will drive cars in the future, but people will always be needed to clean up after other people. That’s the reality.

Sustainability and smart mobility are at the core of Dubai’s vision to become the ‘smartest’ city in the world. Add to the equation the fast developing technology and we witness a big change in how taxis are being operated in the city.
A couple of days ago, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) rolled out 50 Tesla electric vehicles for the limo fleet of the Dubai Taxi Corporation (DTC). Before this, the RTA had endorsed a contract for procuring 554 environment-friendly hybrid cars to support Dubai’s green initiative.
The RTA actually took the first step in a comprehensive plan to reduce pollution and make vehicles in Dubai environment-friendly and fuel-efficient almost a decade ago, Dr Yousef Al Ali, CEO of DTC, said in an exclusive interview with Khaleej Times.By the year-end, Dubai will have 1,582 hybrid taxis (run by various taxi operators) that will help curb the pollution caused by vehicles and save fuel consumption.
On top of that, the DTC, an agency under the RTA, will have a total of 200 Tesla electric cars by 2019 and 50 per cent of its 5,000-unit taxi fleet will be hybrid by 2021. Furthermore, the Dubai Smart Autonomous Mobility Strategy is aimed at converting 25 per cent of total trips into driverless journeys by 2030.
In November 2007, the RTA signed an agreement with US-based General Motors and the Government of Dubai to operate at least 10 hybrid vehicles beginning from January the following year.
Hybrid pioneers
“The pilot trial of 10 hybrid cars proved the seriousness of the RTA in promoting sustainability and adapting to technology. We are the first government entity in the region to operate hybrid taxicabs,” Al Ali pointed out.
He added that “the series of experimentation (of the 10 hybrid taxis) from 2008-2011 resulted in diminishing carbon emissions by 30 per cent and cutting fuel consumption by 30 per cent per vehicle,” which was in line with the strategy to reduce carbon emissions in the emirate by two per cent as called for by the Supreme Council of Energy in Dubai.

Moreover, results of the test run revealed that the first set of hybrid cars covered a total of 550,000km without serious faults or requiring maintenance of major parts.
“Of course, we made some modifications and rewired some parts to make them suitable to our environment,” Al Ali said. According to Al Ali, the cost of procuring hybrid cars was initially subsidised by the government since a hybrid vehicle costs 40 per cent more compared to a regular petrol car.
Reducing carbon emission
“But we are not only talking about the cost or revenue here; we are more focused on sustainability, reducing carbon emission and the future of mobility. Nevertheless, if we talk about fuel consumption, an ordinary vehicle needs about 12.1 litres of petrol to cover 100km, whereas a hybrid vehicle will only consume 8.47 litres to cover the same distance,” Al Ali noted.
“Hybrid vehicles save fuel consumption by as much as 25.41 litres per vehicle per day – equivalent to Dh54.38 savings per vehicle per day (with fuel price at Dh2.14 per litre). They are also environment-friendly – a petrol car generates about 289kg of carbon dioxide emissions per day, whereas hybrid generates only 202kg of carbon dioxide emissions per day,” he underlined.
With the introduction of hybrid taxi, the DTC taxi drivers also underwent intensive training to get familiarised with the vehicles, according to Al Ali. He explained how hybrid cars work. He said they have an internal combustion engine and can be fuelled like normal cars.
When a hybrid car runs below 60km, it uses battery power; when it runs above 60km, it uses fuel and while running on fuel, it generates electric power to recharge the battery pack so it does not need to go to a charging station.
Fast forward
Moving forward, Al Ali said the future of taxis in Dubai and worldwide is in self-driving and electric vehicles. “We need to evaluate how taxis are operated and this will be changed soon,” he said.
He indicated that the way people move around major urban centres, like in Dubai, is bound for a dramatic change. Technological innovations like electrification, connectivity, car-sharing and autonomous vehicles are on the horizon and they are sure to disrupt traditional mobility patterns.
“The taxi sector will be changed;  our traditional way of operating taxis will be changed,” Al Ali emphasised. “We already have the smart taxi app and with just a press of a button, a taxi comes to you.”
Everyday Dubai is growing and there are always new projects that require mobility.  There is a market segmentation and there are strong partnerships that blend public transit and private mobility to produce the best transport solutions, Al Ali said. – The RTA is at the forefront of preparing for the future, according to Al Ali. He noted that the government is crafting regulations consistent with consumer-friendly technological developments that also promote clean air and reduced congestion. These changes will allow people to travel more efficiently, more cheaply, and in various ways.

How hybrid cars work
A hybrid vehicle utilises more than one form of onboard energy to achieve propulsion, meaning it will have a traditional internal-combustion engine and a fuel tank, as well as a battery pack. Hybrids also use an internal combustion engine and can be fuelled like normal cars-but have an electric motor and battery, and can be partially or wholly powered by electricity.
The addition of a battery-powered electric motor increases the fuel efficiency of hybrids. They also pollute less and save drivers money through fuel savings. When a hybrid car runs below 60km, it uses battery power; when it runs above 60km, it uses fuel and while running on fuel, it generates electric power to recharge the battery pack. The battery also provides energy for the air conditioner and other car accessories while the vehicle idles at stoplights or in traffic.
Difference between hybrid and electric car
An electric car is powered by an electric motor instead of a gasoline engine. To put it simply, an electric car is powered exclusively by electricity. The electric motor gets energy from a controller, which regulates the amount of power based on the driver’s use of an accelerator pedal. It uses electrical energy stored in rechargeable batteries. Electric cars require charging stations while hybrid vehicles don’t.
Hybrid taxis play a key role in nurturing a safe, clean and attractive environment:
Fuel efficiency – An ordinary vehicle needs about 12.1 litres of petrol to cover 100 km, whereas a hybrid vehicle needs about 8.47 litres to cover the same distance.
Environment friendly – The ordinary vehicle generates about 289 kg of carbon dioxide emissions per day, whereas hybrid generates only 202 kg of carbon dioxide emissions per day.
Savings – Hybrid vehicles save fuel consumption by as much as 25.41 litres per vehicle per day – equivalent to Dh54.38 savings per vehicle per day (fuel price at Dh2.14 per litre).

India is expected to be a leader in shared mobility by 2030 as rising share of electric and autonomous vehicles will improve shared mile economics, says a Morgan Stanley report.
According to the global financial services major, India offers all the right ingredients to be one of the largest shared mobility markets in the world as it has large population clusters, a young demographic that is well connected to the internet and rising real incomes.
By 2030, Morgan Stanley expects shared miles to reach 35 per cent of all the miles travelled in India and this will further increase to 50 per cent by 2040.
Post 2030, it also expects this trend of shared mobility to partly replace individual car ownership while app-based taxi services will mainly replace public transport rather than personal car usage.
India had 257 billion miles driven in 2017, and of that, 10 per cent were shared (includes traditional taxis and app-based plays), based on Morgan Stanley estimates.
“We believe this can rise to 35 per cent by 2030, implying an 18 per cent CAGR,” it noted.
The report further noted that large population clusters are the first prerequisite for successful shared mobility. India has 61 cities with populations greater than San Francisco’s (850,000 population), and 50 cities with populations of more than 1 million.
Besides, public intercity transportation infrastructure (including trains and local buses) in India have been slow to ramp-up.

Moreover, India’s internet penetration has hit an inflection point as consumers have access to cheaper handsets and affordable data plans.
As per World Bank data, 850 million of Indian are below the age of 35 and since young people are usually quicker to adopt new trends and are less likely to own a car, implying a likelihood of adopting new mobility options.
Further rises in incomes will also lead to higher spending on shared mobility, while economics and demographics will create a pool of drivers.
“Over the next decade, we expect the proportion of shared mobility to expand in the overall mix, and also, within shared mobility, we expect the mix to shift from traditional taxis to app-based plays,” the report said.

Soon private cars will be able to imply as taxis in the country through aggregators like Uber and Ola. A high-level panel has recommended liberalising taxi permit norms to promote shared mobility and reduce the number of vehicles in the cities.
A high-level taskforce has been set up to formulate the action plan and make the transport system less-polluting.

The panel has also made it clear that the passenger safety will be paramount and it has to be ensured that such a move is backed up with proper policy initiatives. The panel has said that there are a limited number of can aggregators in the market right now and it can lead to limited competition, which in turn will allow the cab aggregators to monopolise the policies.
Uber global CEO Dara Khosrowashahi said to ET in an interview,
“We think that it (private car-sharing) takes advantage of the assets that are already here on the road. 
If you look in Delhi, 70% of the cars are driving with one passenger, and we think private car-sharing opens up the opportunity for drivers for a much broader base and it allows Indian cities and governments to make better use of the assets that are on the ground and hopefully can be a positive factor in solving congestion,”
Uber is already allowed to use private vehicles for ride-sharing in USA, Austrailia and Singapore.
The ride-sharing private cars will immensely increase the number of shared cabs on the road, which theoretically will decrease the total number of vehicles on the road.
The new plan will bring down the pollution levels of the cities too. Currently, India has one of the most polluted cities in the world.
The task force has also proposed banning the high-polluting pre-BS III vehicles on the road during the three-month winter season. Delhi is worst hit during the winters as the pollutants get trapped

Tel Aviv is on track to become a capital of mobility, placing Israel as a leader and trendsetter on a global scale in the automotive tech and smart transportation sector. This was a prevailing message at the sixth annual EcoMotion event in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, a one-day conference drawing some 3,000 participants from across the world, including industry leaders, investors, and entrepreneurs.
Israeli tech was also on full display as part of an exhibition with hundreds of startups showcasing the latest innovations in smart and urban mobility, autonomous and electric vehicles, cybersecurity, safety, sensor and radar tech, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Among the attendees were delegations from some of the biggest names in the auto industry, including German auto giant Volkswagen and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, both of whom had significant announcements ahead of the event
Volkswagen inaugurated its new innovation center in Tel Aviv this week, dubbed “Konnect” and which will focus on connectivity, smart navigation, cybersecurity, e-mobility, and big data. The center, according to a company announcement, plans to support “41 local start-ups with innovative business ideas connected to the future of mobility.”

At EcoMotion, Volkswagen Group ran a startup competition where five early-stage Israeli startups were given the opportunity to pitch in six-minute intervals to a panel of judges from the German automotive giant.
Among the competitors were Neteera Technologies, a Jerusalem-based firm developing disruptive, multi-applicational sensing technology; Deeyook, a mobile wireless location sensor; Enigmatos, providing solutions to the threat of vehicle hacking; Insight Acoustics, an optical and acoustic sensor fusion firm; and Make My Day, a route planning app for running errands.
The latter won a six-month professional mentorship at the “Gläserne Manufaktur” or Transparent Factory in Dresden, and office space in “Konnect.”
The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, meanwhile, having launched Alliance Ventures in January, a $1 billion venture capital fund for “next-generation mobility,” announced this week that it was investing an undisclosed amount in an Israeli VC fund focused on car technologies, Maniv Mobility, its first investment in Israel as part of the plan, bringing the company’s total amount of funds invested globally so far to $50 million.
Alliance Ventures deputy head Matthieu De Chanville tells NoCamels at the EcoMotion conference that the firm was quite impressed by a number of Maniv’s portfolio companies, namely Phantom Auto, a company that provides remote-control safety solution for vehicles, Hailo Technologies, a deep learning platform for embedded devices, and Otonomo, an automotive data services platform for connected cars. All three exhibited at the event.
“There are many interesting startups here linked to AI, big data, computer vision,” he says, indicating that the Israeli ecosystem is quite accessible.
Alliance Ventures also announced that it was deepening its engagement in Israel with a new cooperation with the Israeli Innovation Authority. The firm already runs a Tel Aviv location and will partner with the authority to run an incubator in Kiryat Atidim for early-stage startups, particularly ones in the urban smart mobility sphere, according to Antoine Basseville, the director of the Alliance Innovation Lab in the city. Alliance Ventures also runs labs in Silicon Valley, Paris, Yokohama, and Beijing.

Israel on the mobility map
Israel is home to some 600 startups and companies in the auto tech and smart transportation sphere, and in 2017, the industry raised some $800 million in venture capital funds. This marked a significant increase from $120 million just five years ago in 2013, according to a recent report by the IVC Research Center and law firm ZAG S&W.
International auto giants, having sensed the potential of formidable tech, have already established R&D or innovation centers in Israel, including General Motors, Daimler AG, and Ford, which set up a presense here after having acquired Israeli computer vision and machine learning startup SAIPS in 2016.
Israeli companies in the industry have been leaving strong impressions for some time, starting with Better Place, despite its 2013 bankruptcy, but the event that sealed Israel’s place on the mobility map was the acquisition by Intel of Jerusalem-based vision sensor tech company Mobileye in March 2017 for over $15 billion, the largest Israeli exit to date.
And Mobileye has become a key player in the global auto industry.
In addition to developing cutting-edge driving assistance systems, Mobileye is also experimenting with self-driving vehicles on highways in Jerusalem and has plans to expand tests to California and Arizona, according to CEO and co-founder Amnon Shashua.
Mobileye is also part of a collaboration with auto heavyweight BMW, global automotive parts supplier Aptiv (formerly Delphi Automotive), and Kfar-Saba based Innoviz Technologies, which develops LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) remote sensing technology, to bring BMW autonomous vehicles to market.
Mobileye also recently partnered with Israel-based transit data company Moovit, which raised $50 million in a funding round led by Intel, to “improve the world’s urban mobility.”
Innoviz Technologies CEO Omer Keilaf tells NoCamels that “Mobileye is bringing a lot of business to Israel,” adding that the company is not competition for Innoviz and that he appreciates working with other Israeli firms, “What they are providing is very complementary to LiDAR.”
Other Israeli startups that made headlines in the auto ecosystem and beyond recently were Cortica, a company using AI to power autonomous platform that reportedly caught the eye of Elon Musk’s Tesla, and Argus Cyber Security, a global leader in cybersecurity solutions acquired by German car parts supplier Continent AG for over $400 million in November 2017.
Tech and vision
Chris Thomas, the founder and partner of US-based next-generation mobility venture capitalist firm Fontinalis, praised not just Israeli-developed technology at the EcoMotion event, but also Israeli vision.
“Israelis are always looking ahead,” he said, during a panel discussion on smart mobile technologies. Thomas acknowledged that Israelis may strive to model themselves after Americans in the business world, but American entrepreneurs are increasingly looking to Israelis on drive, work ethic, and “war footing,” borrowing from the military term for readiness during combat.

Thomas, whose firm has been a lead investor in Israeli cyber startup Karamba Security, which provides security solutions for connected and autonomous vehicles, said these Israeli traits among others are part of what would make Israeli-founded companies successful.
Greg Urban, executive director of automotive tech at UBS Investment Bank agreed, noting that whereas “Americans want to create the next Google, Facebook, Uber,” Israelis have more “practical” visions, namely what can go to market.
The talk of the town was, of course, the advent of autonomous vehicles and how it will transform the transportation industry.
“The future of autonomous vehicles is going to change the whole perception of car ownership,” Keren Wieder Fanan, global head of ventures at Israeli taxi sharing app Gett said during a panel on mobility trends.
Yoav Hollander, founder and CTO of Foretellix, a company that creates tools to find and verify bugs found in intelligent autonomous systems said that while “everything is going to be autonomous,” Israeli tech is focused on “safety and how to verify that all conditions in autonomous vehicles.”

There is no question that car industry is undergoing a radical change.
The electric car revolution continues to gain momentum.
Daimler said it would have electrified versions of its own models by 2022.
Other companies, including Volvo, VW, Jaguar Land Rover and Honda have made similar pledges.
These are undoubtedly ambitious plans – but it is important to recognise their limitations.

It is widely agreed that the spread of electric vehicles is being held back by a shortage of public charging stations, which makes it hard to take long trips.
And even in “green” cities like Oslo to find a charging station is often a problem.
The range of the batteries is a factor too.
They work great around the city, but as Wintonsworld mentions, the range of these cars fail alarmingly when they accelerate on to the highway, specially when there are hills or in winter conditions.
The other problem with electric cars is that they earn less money for the car companys.
Daimler for example may only earn 20% to 50% the margin of equivalent vehicles with combustion engines.

Shared transport modes were consistently taking over private transit choices in Indian cities, including Hyderabad. Ride-sharing and shuttle services were growing at a pace of 9% per annum.
This against the 3.16% growth rate of urban population.

 
At the 10th Urban Mobility India Conference cum Exhibition and CODATU-XVIII Conference, shared mobility was declared an emerging mode of transport that could ease traffic congestion. Shared mobility should be an unavoidable part of urban planning, experts opined.
Speaking at the meet, Amit Singh, co-founder of OLA cab service, said ride-sharing had revolutionised transportation in India. “With more people who work or live in busy urban pockets using ride-sharing services, including cab-pooling and van-pooling, traffic congestion at several areas have eased,” Mr. Singh said, adding when the private cab services were launched in India, it was unthinkable that customers would be willing to share rides.

“Now, people travel together as they budget their rides that has decongested the city roads to some extent,” Mr. Singh explained.
At city’s IT corridor, car-pooling started as early as in 2005. In the last decade, even apartment and commercial complexes in the area have been encouraging car-pooling to prevent parking congestion, experts who spoke at a panel on share mobility at the three-day conference said.
The experts asked investors to fund alternative transit services, including paratransit, shuttles and microtransit, in India’s smart cities.
While paratransit helps people with disabilities to travel comfortably, microtransit, functional in some developing countries, includes the modes of transport operated by private parties for shared transit.
The paratransit system follows a loose route to help disabled persons get dropped at their place of choice instead of following the rigid public transport route.
Amit Singh, co-founder of Shuttl, a shared transit network, asked the policy-makers to consider such cost-effective, easy transit systems as important as public bus services.

John Ludwig is an electrical engineer and the president of Xevo’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Group. Xevo is a tier-one OEM software company, located in Seattle, that manages automotive software for driver assistance, engagement, and in-vehicle entertainment.
Its main product is the Xevo Market, a merchant-to-driver commerce platform that uses a vehicle’s infotainment screen to make purchases and transations from inside the car. Xevo Market launched at the end of 2017 and is already available in millions of vehicles.
Prior to working with Xevo, Ludwig was a software manager with Microsoft, overseeing operating systems and online service projects. Afterwards, he spent 12 years as a venture capitalist, leading to the formation of his own company, Surround IO, which was then acquired by Xevo in 2017. Ludwig is now the head of the AI department at Xevo, and we spoke with him about the future of AI in cars, how AI will enhance the driving experience, and the future of vehicle autonomy.

John Ludwig is the president of the Artificial Intelligence division at Xevo.
What is Xevo’s goal in the car marketplace? Are you looking to be the go-to company for automotive AI? 
Our focus is having two different approaches towards software inside the vehicle. First there’s the low-level software, which is managing the engine and the driving autonomy of the car, helping manage those millisecond-level decisions. That software domain is one that we don’t participate in directly but work with the manufacturers to leverage that data.
 The second software domain is our main focus, which is on the end user. We focus on what they are doing, their destination, what they trying to accomplish while in the car, and what information do they need or want for their trip to help them make better decisions.

 Our goal is to enhance the experience in the car, increasing the value of the user’s time in the car, and to have access to more services more valuable services.
Creating a better and safer experience: It’s all about making data streams better, and artificial intelligence helps us accomplish this in a couple different ways. First, there’s a large amount of information the user needs to know about their driving in order to be a safer and better driver.
By using AI, we can provide the driver with information on how to be a safer. AI can determine that you tend to be good at driving in the rain but you’re not so good at highway situations, or you’re not very attentive when you get into downtown city areas and you should be more attentive, etc. Because we are making people safer drivers, we can help them obtain lower insurance rates.
Using AI, we can also enhance a driver’s journey. By knowing their preferences, like their favorite coffee spot, or the food and goods they typically purchase, the AI system can offer suggestions on the best way to fill their time at their destination or along the way.
For example, say I didn’t have time to grab my morning coffee: The car’s AI can figure out where their favorite coffee is on the way, the best time to buy it, and where would be the best spot to stop based on their driving trends.
When you talk about learning from user data, where is the data stored and where is the computing taking place? Is the computing done offsite via the cloud or is the computing being performed at the edge, which in this instance would be the car?  
Before we got acquired by XEVO, our company was called Surround IO and we were 100% focused on computing at the edge. We saw the massive growth in the amount of sensor data becoming available and how affordable it was becoming to collect data on the edge.
Computing at the edge is a more efficient method because you can’t possibly send all the data to the cloud. Even if you had the all privacy and security issues handled, the computational access to the cloud will not be as fast as at the edge. We are very focused on trying to push the computing power out to the edge, making full use of the car’s processing capabilities.

The AI software in the car can help find your favorite coffee spot along your route autonomously.
We are seeing quite a bit of that in automation. While the cloud is useful to connect networks, especially those that are located far apart and have a dedicated internet access, several companies have focused on the edge due to faster processing capabilities. 
Correct. There are certain instances where edge computing is the only answer. If you have a pedestrian not paying attention, you need to have the car decide at the edge and apply the right action then and there.
Currently, car manufacturers are devising their own standards for AI deployment. Do you think there needs to be a single standard for AI implementation? Would government regulation help drive the market? 
I think it is a matter of volume scaling. I don’t think it matters so much if you have different standards in Europe vs. North America vs. Asian markets.
My experience from many years in the software industry is that eventually there will be a de facto standard that will arrive and push things forward. If you look to the early days of cell phones, when we had all different kinds of phones and services, it all got washed away, eventually, by IP networking. Standards will emerge and the marketplace will slowly push other things out.
Does Xevo have a preference towards a particular type of sensor?
Our focus is on the software and collecting the data from all different kinds of sensors. We are fairly flexible, but how we obtain the data depends on the car manufacturer. I think there are few frameworks that are going to dominate the field. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon are all pushing very hard in these regions. Those are going to dominate, and we tend to use a lot of Google’s framework for our technology sensor flow. It has a huge community and activity around it.
In any case, we work with all of the frameworks and try to make it easy to move data to and from their systems and their competitor’s systems. This helps our customers to not have to overcommit right now at any one of those frameworks. There’s a lot of transportability of models and data back and forth between them, and that’s good for the industry.

Xevo also helps design car manufacturers’ mobile apps as another way for drivers to stay in touch with their cars.
In which vehicles is your software being currently featured?  
We are in every Toyota or Lexus vehicle. The infotainment experience is in the backend service road vehicles provided by Xevo. The service may be invisible to you, but if you use their mobile app or use any of the infotainment services in the car, that is leveraging our services.
Any late model GM vehicle uses our service. The Market was launched last year, which allows you to make in-car payments for services such as fuel or food ordering.  It is currently available now in two million of their vehicles, with plans to roll it into future GM lines.
We recently announced a new partnership with Hyundai, which will allow customers to find and pay for coffee, gas, and parking using their car’s infotainment screen. The news services will work the Hyundai Blue Link connected-car system.
One of the big things we are focused on doing with all this data is figuring out how to monetize it and turn it into actual revenue for merchants and the OEMs. In our business that is the aspect that is missing. Several manufacturers are talking about how we can collect data and share it, but it’s really important for the OEMs and for all the people providing the data that there is a monetization model.
The first step is to demonstrate how our technology can generate new revenue transactions, to help defray the cost of investing in more sensor equipment for the manufacturer. We also have to ensure the end user that the data will be secure and private before being sent it to the cloud. Because ultimately the end user has to feel good and have confidence about how their data is being used.
I definitely see the potential benefits and concerns for end users. On the one the hand, the AI assistance can be immensely useful from preventing accidents, correcting bad driving habits, and assisting them on their day-to-day tasks. On the other hand, you have privacy concerns and users’ information and data being misused.   
We feel like this will be first be implemented in fleet use cases, where someone is driving the vehicle as a service. The fleet company is paying for the insurance and operation of the vehicle. The company can then deploy our software to help track the driver’s performance and provide the company’s insight. This can help with insurance rates by proving the reliability of the fleet drivers.
What is your personal take on the future of self-driving cars? Where do you think we will be in five to 10 years from now?  
Xevo doesn’t directly invest in the autonomy, but I certainly have my own opinions on how it will unfold. I suspect we’re going to have some situational autonomy sooner rather than later, but I think full autonomy will take a while. For example, take the carpooling lane on the highway: If that was to be reclassified as only for autonomous vehicles, you can control the vehicles on the highway and help streamline traffic.
In downtown areas, where people are pulling cars in-and-out of different parking situations and garages, dealing with so much foot and bike traffic, it is a more complicated situation. It strikes me that it may take us a while before we are ready to take all that on.
What do you see as the future of Xevo? Is the goal to be in every car manufacturer on the market?  
I’ll think you’ll see Xevo software in every car manufacturer in the next five years. We have engagements with every significant carmaker right now, and we have contracts with Asian car manufacturers as well. With autonomous vehicles approaching the market, people will be spending more time in their cars and looking to enhance their driving experience. That’s great for us because we can we can offer them solutions and services to take advantage of their time.

When Bronwen Morgan and her husband Jim Conley moved back to Australia with two small children in tow, her mother lent them her car.
But within a week they’d racked up two parking tickets near their home in South Coogee in Sydney.
Why is Melbourne’s peak hour so bad?


The ABS stats are in, revealing what’s behind congestion in ‘the world’s most liveable city’.


“We asked her to take it back,” Ms Morgan said.
Five years later, Ms Morgan and her husband still don’t have a car. Both adults work in the eastern suburbs and ride a bike to work, while the children Cassidy, 9, and Brooklyn, 7, walk to school.
The family has groceries delivered and gets around mostly by walking, cycling and catching buses.
“It definitely does make you more physically active and I wanted the kids to have that habit, especially of walking to school,” Ms Morgan said. “We have good conversations as we walk and ride to school, and more encounters with other people so it’s a less privatised life with better communication and more connection to community.
It’s also a practical way to make the kids aware of climate change and the environment.”
The family uses a car once a week on a Saturday to do any extra shopping and ferry the children between activities such as swimming and drama. They borrow a car through a car share scheme, paying by the hour and kilometre.
Car sharing is a growing trend. The pioneer in Australia was GoGet, which launched in 2003.
It now has 95,000 members and 2300 vehicles across Australia. In the City of Sydney, one in five residents are GoGet members.

Other car sharing services include GreenShareCar, FlexiCar and DriveMyCar.
Car Next Door estimates each car share vehicle represents 10 cars that have been disposed of or avoided, resulting in a net reduction of nine vehicles.
Yet despite the emergence of car sharing and also ridesharing services such as Uber, car ownership rates are increasing even in the biggest cities.
In the 2016 census, only 8 per cent of households in greater capital cities did not own a car. Back in 1991, 14 per cent of households in greater capital cities managed without a car and it’s been a steady decline since then.
Australians are also increasingly likely to have multiple cars. In 1991, 46 per cent of households in greater capital cities had two or more cars, compared with 58 per cent in 2016.
Recent figures from the Bureau of Statistics suggest transport is our third biggest expense, behind housing and food, soaking up 14.5 per cent of household budgets.
At first, Ms Morgan and Mr Conley used GoGet and they’re still members, but now they mostly use Car Next Door.
Ms Morgan said this was because there were four Car Next Door vehicles on their street alone and it works out cheaper on a day rate. She also likes the idea of using cars that already exist.
Ms Morgan said car sharing is easier now the kids are bigger and they no longer need to install car seats, but it’s starting to cost more because of the kids’ activities increasing.
Ms Morgan estimates they spend $350-400 a month on renting cars, covering all expenses, including petrol, insurance and services. It used to be more like $250 a month.
“I’m not sure it’s that much cheaper than owning a car but it’s less hassle,” she said.

A forum hosted by Smart City Consortium on June 1 explored how technology shapes lives. Smart mobility is a way to move people and goods using new technology that is faster, cleaner, more accessible than traditional options, striving towards automated and personalized travel on-demand as well as providing an efficient, safe and comfortable transport system.
Information and communication technology infrastructure, combined with open data, are the keys to making mobility smarter.
HK on the move
It is important to Hong Kong, as citizens are heavy users of public transport.
“In Hong Kong, there are 12.6 million passenger trips on public transport every day, with the railway being the backbone,” says Charles So, executive director of Traffic and Transport Planning at AECOM. “In addition, there are 354 licensed vehicles for every kilometer of road.”
He says Hong Kong has been doing a lot in this regard. They city has an automatic toll collection system, a mobile application called HK eTransport that shows users different routes and real-time public transport mobile applications.
Next step
The next thing for Hong Kong to do, according to So, is to develop an all-in-one application that integrates different platforms for real-time data, as well as a free-flow tolling system that allows high-speed free-flow tolling for all road users driving through the toll gantry without the need of toll plaza and toll booths.

“The ultimate goal of smart mobility is [to move] towards automated systems, from the fully-integrated ones,“ says So. “By then, automated predictive technologies would be adopted.”
He even suggests, developing smart intersections: smart devices for pedestrian crossing that assist the elderly and the disabled.
Meanwhile, Kelvin Shum, senior director at Esri China (Hong Kong), lays out six indicators for developing smart mobility – safe and secure, well-run, livable, health, prosperous and sustainable.
“Real-time data are needed, so we can develop applications for users to acquire the information they need to reduce waiting time,” says Shum. “We also need to promote green mobility to reduce pollution and alleviate congestion. This can improve people’s health and save their time.”
Shum also suggests clean energy for vehicles for the sake of sustainability.
One game changer, according to Shum, is geographic information system (GIS). With GIS, we can understand travel patterns, help response to crisis and traffic incidents, improve overall safety and security and identify ways for cost saving during journey through integrating real-time data, analyzing it and sending notifications to the users.
In the end, Hong Kong would have the potential to be a pioneer in the region to make mobility easier and friendlier.
“Hong Kong can be a superconnector. It can make “smart city” a major industry to influence the region and set an example for neighbouring cities such as Shenzhen,” said David Chung, Under Secretary for the Innovation and Technology Bureau, who speaks on the government’s behalf.
“Technology drives change, shaping our city, our lives and our government. The government is improving its service to manage the city better and serve the citizens better,” says Chung.

The firm is bringing the US-based Jump electric bike-share start up to Europe, starting in Berlin this summer, and then rolling out to other cities.

Uber purchased Jump just two months ago and the distinctive, red e-bikes are already present in cities like San Francisco and Washington D.C., where they can be hired at rates of just $2 for half-an-hour.
The service enables Jump customers to find an available bike via the app, take a ride and then just lock it up wherever they finish the trip. Uber is currently piloting a scheme to integrate Jump access within the main app.
https://youtu.be/aPifQltyUdU

Uber’s quick efforts to bring Jump to Europe come as it battles a number of controversies and a decidedly less-welcoming environment in Europe, compared to its U.S. homeland.
 
The ride-sharing service is currently banned in London after Transport for London revoked its operating license in the capital. It has also been forced into shutting down some services in countries like Belgium, Germany, France, Italy and Spain.

The Jump introduction is part of a charm offensive in Europe, but sees the firm enter a competitive market. Berlin already has 18,000 bikes (via The Verge) available to residents and tourists.











“I want this to signal a deep commitment to Germany,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said at the event (via Reuters).
“Germany is a little bit of a signal of what the new Uber can be like… We want to work with local governments and cities to make our model work.”

INDIA is examining the use of private vehicles as shared taxis in an effort to reduce car ownership and curb growing traffic congestion in major cities, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

India’s federal think-tank, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has partnered with companies including ride-sharing firm Uber Technologies to assess the economic and environmental impact of using private cars as taxis, a government official involved in the process said.
Increasing the availability of cars that can be used as cabs would be welcome news for Uber and its SoftBank backed local rival Ola, although it could heighten tensions with taxi operators that typically pay higher fees for commercial licences while facing more rigorous vehicle testing.
India’s government wants to reduce private car ownership, the official said, adding the three-month study will look at the safety, regulatory, tax and insurance implications.
While the study is in its early days, the broad idea is to set up a clear and reasonable regulatory framework for ridesharing so it allows companies to operate in India without ambiguity, another source involved in the process said.

Although Uber is allowed to use private cars for ride sharing in countries such as Australia and Singapore, their use has faced opposition from taxi operators in parts of North America.
An Uber spokesman said sharing private vehicles could help cut congestion and ensure more efficient use of cars.According to analysts, allowing the use of private cars as taxis would improve the supply of vehicles at a low cost. 
“We are engaging with a range of stakeholders in India about the best way to realise this vision,” he said.
But such a move could dent car sales in India where the ownership ratio is already low compared with other countries. There are fewer than 20 cars for every 1,000 people in India.
Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai Motor and Tata Motors are among the top-selling carmakers in the country, which is forecast to be the world’s third-largest car market by 2020.
Uber and Ola have built their taxi “fleets” in India by offering incentives such as free smartphones and cash bonuses to drivers, but both are now cutting back on these in an attempt to be profitable.


Allowing the use of private cars as taxis would improve the supply of vehicles at a low cost, say analysts.
“If most of these cars are affiliated with Ola and Uber then it’s a win for them,” Neil Shah, research director at consultant Counterpoint Research, said.
The proposal, however, could antagonise current drivers, who have paid hefty fees to get a commercial taxi licence.
Concerns around the safety of passengers would also need to be addressed, said Shah, adding any new law must ensure private car drivers go through the same background and safety checks. – Reuters

What will the city of tomorrow look like? What will it be like to live in?


While it would be easy to say “like they now, but bigger and hopefully with flying cars”, only one part of that is actually going to be true: the bit about being bigger.
​At the moment there are 22 cities in Asia alone with populations that will soon exceed 10 million and that number is only going to grow.



Rajendra Rao heads up the Ford Smart Mobility division: we shouldn't be ""shackled
by mobility"".




While New Zealand is tiny in comparison, these trends will affect us through the products and services we buy.
 Traditional car manufacturers in particular will have to adapt and change to suit the needs of customers who, by sheer weight of numbers, will be primarily living in these super-cities.

A few years back Ford announced that it wasn’t a “car” company in a traditional sense any more, and would be even less so in the future. Ford, one of the Big Three US auto manufacturers; part of the backbone of the American dream of a house, a nice car and 2.5 children, a company that was built by the car as much as it built cars, had become a “mobility company”.
In the intervening years Ford has been investing in technology startups and has also started a new division of its own, Ford Smart Mobility LLC. According to Ford, this is “designed to compete like a startup company” and will design and build mobility services on its own through its Greenfield Labs business incubation team.
It also collaborates with start-ups and tech companies, such as the company’s acquisition of Chariot, an app-based, crowd-sourced shuttle company, and its collaboration with Motivate to launch Ford GoBike in San Francisco.
Ford recently held a City of Tomorrow symposium in New Delhi, India, in conjunction with TED talks. During the event we got a chance to sit down with the CEO of Ford Smart Mobility, Rajendra Rao, and Ford’s executive director of strategy, for Asia-Pacific, Jeffery Jones, to talk about what they think the city of tomorrow might look like.

“You have to question the future,” said Rao. “Is what we are encountering today with congestion, gridlock and the lack of mobility a future that will be sustainable?
“What we are most concerned about is what actions we can take to make the most impact and drive the future?”
According to Rao, this means we should be allowed to freely experience cities at their best, which means being able to “access all the riches of the community without having to burdened and shackled by lack of mobility.”
As an example, Jones cites a project the company is currently working on in the city of Indore in India, where it’s helping the local government to encourage higher use of public transport, a somewhat unusual project for a car company to get involved in.
“It is to help improve transportation systems and it is much broader than just traditional vehicles,” he says.
“It is looking at all forms of transportation. It’s looking at the multi-modal journey.
“There is a combination of shared mobility elements that will go into that city of  tomorrow: everything from existing rail transport to shared methods of transport.
“Helping customers on the journey and taking out some of the ‘pain points’ along that journey is what we are trying to do in India.”
While just a decade or so ago it may be easy to dismiss such problems as being something for future generations, the reality is that it is something that we need to be addressing right now, and not necessarily in conventional terms, according to Rao.
“I think the problem is so significant right now that we should try unconventional methods to solve it. I think if we try the conventional methods that have been going on for the past 25 years we might be sitting here 10 years from now with an even bigger problem on our hands.
“My fear is not having enough unconventional ideas.”

One of the nation’s first fully-planned communities, Coral Gables, Florida is making news by making good on its founders’ mission. When George Merrick created the south Florida city in 1925, he envisioned a city that would offer every amenity to its residents, while at the same time would become a center for international business. In every respect, Merrick’s dream has come true.
A Smart City Hub was launched on the City’s website in May, allowing Coral Gables to share the success of its artificial intelligence and open data with students, engineers, developers and others who see a benefit in collaborating.
Considering its historical appreciation of architecture, culture and connectivity among its people, it’s hardly surprising the city would find new ways to connect people with information.
The Hub is a public platform for exploring and downloading open data; for discovering and building apps; and for engaging to solve important local issues. Collaborators and the public can access convenient city services, analyze and combine Open Datasets using maps and graphs, as well as develop new web and mobile applications. History meet hi-tech.
Home to the University of Miami and 51,000 residents, Coral Gables is  continuing a strong track record of supporting both its residential and business sectors with more excellent City services.
This Smart Hub is just the latest of many hi-tech initiatives implemented in recent years. Its role is clear: delivering value, transparency, mobility, business intelligence and tools for citizen engagement. Amidst a thriving downtown district, residents and businesses now have a single entry point to access a vast treasure trove of public technology.
“A Collaboration and Open Data Platform for a Beautiful and Smart City,” the Smart City Hub delivers value, transparency, enhanced mobility, business intelligence, and various tools for citizenship engagement. Users can explore this public platform and download open data in order to develop new web and mobile applications.
Citizens and business owners have a single entry point to access public technology, such as: an App Store transparency portals with financial data and dashboards; eGov customer service to pay/register online for services; tools for record search; real-time pedestrian sensors; interactive maps; citizen engagement tools; and many other resources.

Features of the Coral Gables’ City Hub include:

Transparency Portals – allowing visitors to view financial and public information in dashoards and graphs. Examples include Capital Improvement Financials, City Financial Expenditures, City Election History and Demographics, and Permit Inspections Scheduled, among others.
Citizen Engagement – With the mission of connecting people with each other, this section allows residents access to “GovQA Customer Connect,” Public Police Records, Sustainable Living information, and provides a Virtual Tour of Coral Gables.
The App Store makes it easy for residents to download apps relating to traffic, parking, the trolley, and pay by phone options.
eGov City Services – allows users to pay for everything from a Building License to Certificate of Use, Invoices, Stormwater Bills, Lease, City Vendor Registration and Special Assessment to Parking Permits, Park Membership at the touch of a button. A connection to the City Employee Portal and a Careers Section are also updated regularly.
Open Data – connecting people with information, focuses on Coral Gables’ Agriculture, Boundaries, Business, Community Safety, Education, Health, Housing and Transportation. Web Apps powered by Open Data also include public access to Debris reporting and removal, sustainable living initiatives, information on historic districts and properties, and summary statistics and demographics.
Geographic Information Science or “The Science of Where” serves as a search engine for the Internet of Things, where viewers fine and use Open IoT data from around the world. For those who live, work and do business in Coral Gables, this offers access to data relating to Bike Routes, Public Works (street lights, traffic), the city’s popular Trolley, and even a Museum Exploration Map.

Connecting Data to a more informed community
City representatives are proud of Coral Gables’ ability to mesh old world values with new age technology. The city website details how “Coral Gables’ unique past is evident today, in the preservation of architecture and landmarks, but also in the spirit of its residents and the philosophy that guides its government.”
In designing the city in 1925, Merrick drew from the Garden City and City Beautiful movements of the 19th and early 20th Century. The city is renowned for successfully incorporating secluded residential enclaves and commercial areas inspired by the architectural style of the Mediterranean.
As city leaders see it, the same principles that made Coral Gables a success at its inception guide its current policies. Emphasis on protecting the residential sectors, preserving the natural environment and maintaining an international flavor are long-standing traditions.
With its newly-launched Smart City Hub, one of the first fully-planned communities in the nation is paving the way for others once again.

Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo showing off her scooter. Image: Getty.

By Alfie Shaw





The mayor of Paris, Anne Hildago, is fighting for a cleaner, healthier city.
The city has one of the densest metro systems in the world, its bicycle sharing platform is Europe’s largest, and in 2011 it opened an electric car sharing service that carries Parisians 93,000km ever day – yet the private car remains a backdrop to Parisian life.
And so, like many mayors before her, she has made private cars the principal target of her efforts to reduce air pollution.
Hildago’s latest effort to tempt motorists away from their cars is CityScoot, an electric moped sharing scheme.
The service has grown by more than 500 per cent in the last year, now maintaining a network of 1,000 scooters across Paris, and is accessible to anyone with a driver’s license via a smartphone app. The service is paid for by the minute, with no contract required.
The CityScoot pitch is an attractive one: collect your electric moped from anywhere in inner Paris, ride it to your destination – for slightly more than a bus or metro ticket but less than a taxi – and then park it wherever is convenient and legal, no charging point required. I went to Paris to find out if CityScoot lives up to its promise.
I signed up with CityScoot’s smartphone app, which also controls the service.
I uploaded photographs of my driver’s licence (car or moped, with free voluntary lessons available for those new to two wheels), handed over my card details and was ready to ride. The service costs 28 cents per minute all in, or 20 if purchased in bulk.
Reserving a scooter was simple.
I selected the nearest of the hundreds visible on the app, yielding a four-digit code that unlocked it when entered on the scooter’s key pad. Rather than carrying my own, I used the helmet and hair net under the saddle and stored my bag in the compartment.
I zipped away from the lights much more quickly than any car on the road, but nowhere near as quickly as Paris’s ubiquitous peloton of lunatic motorcyclists, who zip effortlessly through tiny gaps between cars at high speed.
I easily passed gridlocked traffic and jumped to the front of the queue at lights. CityScoots can run at 28mph, which is ample for inner-city travel, even amidst the apparent chaos of the Arc de Triomphe.

Few activities provide the feeling of transcending tourist-status like commuting by moped in a foreign city. Better served by an arsenal of French curses than by any highway code, I enjoyed a transient feeling of belonging as I heard a barked ‘putain!’ over the whirring of my CityScoot ’s electric motor.
Scooters are also much better suited to the sharing economy than electric cars, free as they are from the requirement for expensive fixed charging infrastructure.
The owner of Paris’s AutoLib electric car sharing scheme, Bolloré Group, has seen its efforts to bring the £100m scheme to London delayed by more than a year as a result of the unwillingness of London’s 33 local authorities to accept a common agreement on parking and charging infrastructure.
CityScoot bypasses this quagmire by requiring no charge points, allowing users to park wherever is legal.
The 1000-scooter network is maintained by a fleet of electric vans that continually substitute drained batteries with full ones, bringing power to the vehicles rather than vice versa.
In doing so, CityScoot reduces infrastructure overheads, maximises the network’s coverage by freeing it from fixed points, and increases its availability by eliminating the requirement for charge time.
Whereas AutoLib’s growth has stalled in the face of €179m loss forecasts, the market for electric scooter sharing continues to grow. This summer, CityScoot will face a new competitor of the streets of Oaris. Coup has grown by over 400 per cent in only eight months since its launch in Berlin last year. Now the Bosch subsidiary aims to release 600 of its electric scooters on Paris this summer.
The competition looks set to slash prices for consumers as Coup promises a €3 per half hour flat fee followed by a euro for every additional ten minutes, less than half the price of CityScoot ’s cheapest by-the-minute offer.
This could plausibly transform electric scooter sharing from a novelty into a genuinely viable alternative for many metro commuters.
Electric scooter sharing services provide a cheap, clean alternative for inner-city car drivers forced off the road by ever increasing charges – and, during air pollution crises like that which struck Paris last year, driving bans.
As competition leads to price wars, scooter sharing might even tempt some commuters away from ever more crowded buses and trains, while the prospect of zero emissions transport without investment in charging infrastructure and parking space is sure to appeal to local authorities. In increasingly post-car cities, electric scooter sharing is sure to be a fixture of diverse transport mixes.

DETROIT — General Motors said Thursday it will bring self-driving technology in the form of ride sharing to consumers by next year. It said the vehicles would be introduced in the United States, but did not say in which cities it planned to roll out the service.
To hasten that goal, the automaker has partnered with technology investor SoftBank Vision Fund to invest in GM Cruise technology, the automaker said Thursday.
SoftBank, a large technology investment company with stakes in such companies as Uber, will invest $2.25 billion in GM Cruise Holdings, and GM will invest $1.1 billion in GM Cruise, its self-driving arm, when the transaction closes at the end of June, the company said.
“This would be one of the largest scaled or the largest scaled effort in the space,” Michael Ronen, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, told the media. “There is a lot of interest in the space. This is as big as it gets.”
While GM has not yet had discussions with government agencies on approval to put self-driving cars on the roads, Chairman and CEO Mary Barra said she’s confident they will be supportive because, “This technology is going to improve safety on our roadways.”

The company did not say whether it planned to launch its own ride service or partner with another company.
GM leaders said the automaker was prepared on its own to fund GM’s long-stated goal of launching commercial autonomous vehicles at scale beginning in 2019. But in discussions with SoftBank over the past few months, GM found the two shared the same vision to bring autonomous vehicle technology to market.
The partnership will speed GM’s goal and help attract more talent to the GM Cruise team. GM Cruise employed 40 people when GM acquired it two years ago, today it employees about 800, said GM President Dan Ammann.
GM has a $500 million investment in ride sharing company Lyft, which it made in 2016.
“Our Cruise and GM teams together have made tremendous progress over the last two years,” Barra said in a news release. “Teaming up with SoftBank adds an additional strong partner as we pursue our vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.”
The SoftBank Vision Fund investment will be made in two pieces. Vision Fund will invest the first slice of $900 million. When the Cruise autonomous vehicles are ready for commercial deployment, the Vision Fund will make the second investment of $1.35 billion, “subject to regulatory approval,” GM said.
SoftBank Vision Fund will own 19.6 percent equity in GM Cruise, GM will own the balance. This investment process will give GM flexibility with respect to capital allocation, GM said.
“The GM Cruise approach of a fully integrated hardware and software stake gives it a unique competitive advantage,” said Michael Ronen, managing partner of SoftBank Investment Advisors in a media statement. “We are very impressed by the advances made by the Cruise and GM teams, and are thrilled to help them lead a historic transformation of the automobile industry.”
The GM and SoftBank Vision Fund investments are expected to provide the necessary capital to reach commercialization of autonomous vehicles “at scale” beginning in 2019, GM said.
“We’ve been in discussion for quite some time. We’re very aligned as to what this technology can bring to the world,” Ammann said.
“The capital we’re raising and announcing today is very significant and will carry us to full deployment.”
Ronen of SoftBank concurred.
“This feels like the right time. There’s still work to do between now and next year to make this work,” Ronen said.
“We have invested significant amounts of capital in ride sharing globally. We’ve made other investments in technology that relates to automotive including artificial intelligence. Frankly, we’re also at the beginning of that investment strategy as it relates to automotive and there’ll be plenty of opportunities,” to do more, Ronen said.
There is exclusivity between GM and SoftBank. The two have agreed to a seven-year term before either can change their arrangement. Both companies said that time frame will provide enough time to significantly grow technology.

The newest report from AlixPartners — whose client roster includes corporate boards and management, law firms, investment banks and other kinds of investors — cautioned the industry that a “used-car time bomb” is about to explode.
AlixPartners explained that it arrived at that dire assertion through a project that began two years ago through what the firm identified as the “CASE” trends that are “completely revolutionizing” the automotive industry — the connected, autonomous, shared and electric vehicles of the not-too-distant future.
AlixPartners released this analysis detailing how automakers, suppliers and other industry players need to evolve their organizations and their partnering approaches to successfully transition to a “new automotive ecosystem.”
Using several examples, the firm detailed where companies, often relying on traditional auto-industry approaches, are falling behind and why they should consider revamping their operating models.

The report projected a significant downturn in U.S. new-vehicle sales ahead, to 16.9 million light-vehicle units this year and to a cyclical trough of 15.2 million units in 2019 — partly driven by a “used-car time bomb” of 500,000 more off-lease vehicle-returns in 2017 versus 2016, on top of the 500,000 more units in 2016 versus 2015.
The reports noted these trends will likely be a “double-whammy” to new-vehicle sales, displacing turns to cheaper used vehicles while increasing lease payments on new vehicles as leases get written with anticipated higher residual rates and tighter credit standards.
While dealerships might be turn more used vehicles, AlixPartners also mentioned that as more off-lease vehicles fill the wholesale market, firm analysts are projecting that used-vehicle prices will soften at a rate double the 13-percent drop they believe already has happened since 2014, costing captive finance companies up to $5 billion.
Beyond just the growth in off-lease volume, AlixPartners spent much effort on looking at how vehicle technology is going to impact which models might roll over the curb more quickly and which ones might need a spiff to get delivered.

On the connectivity front, the AlixPartners analysis pointed to the example of Tesla’s “high-spec” center-stack display, featuring over-the-air upgrades from the company and iPad-like features.
Though this feature has been on the market since the 2012 model year, and has garnered strong reviews from consumers, AlixPartners noted that no other major automaker has moved to match the system.
On the autonomous-vehicle front, the AlixPartners analysis found there are now more than 50 major companies now working on autonomous vehicles or full autonomous-vehicle systems, as well as a plethora of smaller companies and start-ups.
This “Wild-West” environment will likely result in a handful of big winners, according to the study, but on the other hand, also many disappointed investors.
The report also mentioned that many of the newer high-tech entrants have completely different “DNAs” than traditional automotive companies, including being used to high returns on capital.
Given the “white-hot” competition brewing, the analysis predicts that AV systems-costs could drop 78 percent by 2025.
On the shared-mobility front, the analysis included a survey of a total of 2,000 U.S. adult consumers that showed just how fast things are changing in today’s automotive world.
The survey polled 1,000 consumers across 10 large markets where both car-sharing and ride-sharing are popular (the metro areas of Austin, Texas, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Portland, Ore., Seattle, San Francisco, Oakland, Calif., and Washington, D.C.) and, as a control group, 1,000 respondents across the entire U.S. This effort mirrored a consumer survey by AlixPartners in November 2013.
In this year’s survey, consumers in the 10 trend-setting markets said their awareness for virtually all major car-sharing brands (names such as Zipcar, Car2Go and Enterprise CarShare) has decreased, and 21 percent of respondents were unable to name any brands at all.
By contrast, this year’s survey also asked users of ride-sharing (brands like Uber and Lyft) in those same 10 markets about their intended usage in the next 12 months versus their past usage, and 24 percent said their usage would be more than in the past, versus just 5 percent who said less — an 18-percentage-point difference.
Meanwhile, AlixPartners said just 17 percent of car-sharing users surveyed in those markets said they would employ car-sharing more in the coming 12 months than in the past — versus 16 percent who said they would use that mobility service less in the year ahead.
Moreover, among respondents in the 10 markets, the survey found that ride-sharing was five times more likely to be a top-three transportation mode than was car-sharing (11.6 percent versus 2.5 percent), and three times more likely than traditional taxis (11.6 percent versus 4.2 percent).
In addition, among millennials surveyed in the key markets, 9 percent said ride-sharing has allowed them to postpone or avoid getting a driver’s license — what AlixPartners contends is another indicator of today’s fast-changing times.
Another key finding of the survey, coupled with AlixPartners analysis, is that in the 10 key markets each vehicle used in car-sharing is likely replacing the need for 19 personal vehicles — a decrease from 32 vehicles based on the results from AlixPartners’ 2013 survey.
Meanwhile, according to the same analysis, one vehicle used in ride-sharing is likely displacing four personal vehicles. The report went on to note that both ride- and car-sharing vehicles are typically replacing vehicles driven less than 5,000 miles per year, not typical commuting vehicles.
On the electrification front, the AlixPartners study reveals that China is investing heavily to take a leadership role in electric vehicles. In an example of that, the report noted that Chinese automakers commanded 96 percent of the 2016 market in China for full electric vehicles (not including hybrids), more than double their share (43 percent) for all types of light vehicles. It also finds that of the 103 EVs to be launched globally by 2020, 49 of them will come from China-based automakers.
The report additionally predicts that China is targeting to have two-thirds of the world’s manufacturing capacity for lithium-ion batteries by 2021 (175 GWh of power, or the equivalent of five Tesla “giga-factories”).
Meanwhile, the report recapped that hybrid sales in the U.S. have slowed, from 3.2 percent of the market in 2013 to just 2.1 percent so far in 2017, while plug-in and battery-electrics sales, while increasing, still represent only 1.0 percent of the market. This, says the study, underscores the need for maximum flexibility in both organizations and partnerships to handle the expected, but bumpy, shift to the new automotive ecosystem that’s coming.
Finally, and also in a way on the partnership front, the AlixPartners study determined that private-equity firms have switched, in droves, from being buyers to sellers — most often to “strategics” (companies in the auto industry already), as private-equity-to-strategics deals skyrocketed from 6 percent of total auto-M&A transaction values in 2013 to 84 percent in 2016.
John Hoffecker, global vice chairman at AlixPartners and a 30-year automotive veteran, said, “There’s an all-new automotive ecosystem developing, and I fear that many players really aren’t prepared for it.
The changes coming are the biggest since the internal-combustion engine pushed aside horses and buggies, yet what the exact changes will be are as unpredictable as trying to guess which app is going to be most popular on next year’s smartphones.
“Leading players will be those that both study hard and are fast on their feet,” Hoffecker continued.
Mark Wakefield, global co-head of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners, added, ”With the rapid but uncertain developments in connectivity, autonomy, shared mobility and electrification, traditional approaches to partnering and running organizations could well be setting up the auto industry to be disrupted.
“Fast and savvy organizations that build their own agile ecosystems and create smart partnerships, but without locking themselves into technologies that may become quickly outdated, will be best positioned to afford the needed ‘CASE’ investments of the future and to prosper from the coming industry changes rather than being rolled over by them,” Wakefield went on to say.

Car-Sharing: Owning a car can be a hassle, especially if you live somewhere where driving is an occasional, rather than daily, necessity. This might help to explain why car-sharing schemes are going from strength to strength in cities around the world.
Car-sharing has the potential to reduce private car use and ownership, and over the past two decades has been adopted by more than a million users worldwide. Car-sharing schemes now operate in some 1,100 cities in 26 countries.


In Sydney, one in ten households is predicted to be a member of a car-sharing organisation by 2016. In Australia, car-sharing is most frequently a for-profit service that provides members with access to a fleet of vehicles, typically on an hourly basis. Services like Go Get in Sydney and Flexicar in Melbourne allow members to book online or by smartphone app. They then unlock their reserved car using an electronic keycard, jump in, and drive off.
Members are billed at the end of the month for time and/or kilometers traveled. Cars are located in central business areas, neighborhoods and major employment centers, as well as at public transport stations.
This “quick lease” model is the most common, allowing users to do some bulky shopping, run errands requiring a short trip, or go for an out-of-town daytrip, without needing to own their own car. Car-sharing can also be “peer-to-peer,” where an individual car owner makes their car available for others to rent for a short period of time, or one-way, where cars can be picked up and dropped off at different locations, freeing the user from the return journey.
While we know that more and more people are getting into car-sharing, we don’t know a lot about its ascendance to popularity. To shed some light on its success, we have been investigating the factors that make it work — and we have found three broad reasons:
1. Technology
Car-sharing could never overturn the dominance of private cars without the help of technology. Streamlined booking systems, accurate billing, good car security, reliable location mapping: all are crucial to car-sharing’s rise as a viable business model. Automation also makes car-sharing easy, flexible and reliable, and makes it feel more like driving a private vehicle and less like a car rental.
2. Existing transport infrastructure
Car-sharing taps into the powerful system that already supports private car use, such as roads, petrol stations, and parking lots. Once you’re behind the wheel, a share-scheme car feels basically the same as driving a private one.
Yet car-sharing also allows users to rely on other transport options, such as public transport, walking or cycling, for their day-to-day mobility. Shared cars then “fill the gaps” left by fixed routes and timetables, and provide extra load-carrying capacity when needed.
Of course, this only makes sense in places where living without a car is a viable option. As a result, car-sharing is overwhelmingly concentrated in inner cities with high density and good networks for public and active transport.
3. Parking
Ironically enough, car-sharing’s success may come down to the humble parking space. The same inner-urban places where car sharing has flourished are also characterised by parking congestion. On-street parking in these places is at a premium, mainly because of high density but also because road space is more likely to be reserved for bus and bike lanes.
Yet this situation actually makes car-sharing
more attractive, because parking spaces are specifically reserved for car-share vehicles.
Essentially, car-sharing is successful because it uses new technologies to tap into and tweak existing transport systems, both private and public.
It conveniently borrows roads, petrol stations and parking spaces from private cars, yet at the same time relies on an alternative transport network that is robust enough to support a life lived without a private car.
Car-sharing is thriving in Australia even in the relative absence of support from transport policy. Car-share schemes don’t feature in New South Wales’ Long Term Transport Masterplan, nor in Victoria’s Plan Melbourne strategy.
Our review of car-sharing policy revealed that the area where it most regularly comes into contact with transport planning is the mundane arena of parking regulations. Local councils typically set aside a certain number of on-street spaces for shared cars. It is also increasingly popular for the design controls for new apartments to mandate provisions for car-sharing parking spaces.
It might seem odd that the success of car-sharing rests not on the cars themselves, but on where they can park. Yet parking space is already a source of tension for motorists, and this tension could be raised still further by this highly visible newcomer. It is not the only space where shared and private cars compete, yet for the private car driver on the hunt for a park, it is difficult to ignore the shared car sitting in its guaranteed, VIP parking spot.
Local government parking policies therefore provide a valuable source of support for the nascent car-sharing industry. It is inspiring that a local council will bravely defend the shared car’s right to space in the heated arena that is car parking, and in doing so make a more sustainable mode of transport possible.
Private car use will be challenged not through mass uptake of public transport or cycling, but rather through the subtle orchestration of less problematic alternatives. Car-sharing is such an alternative.
While it has quietly emerged to challenge the private car, its ongoing rise will need continuing support from local governments.

Imagine never having to walk to, wait for and frustrate over a bus again, but, rather, the vehicle is conveniently routed directly to you, on-demand, in accordance with your own specifications.
Such is the vision of RouteValet, which has developed an innovative technology that aims to fundamentally change the way transportation networks function. No longer will there be fixed stations and schedules; instead, routes will be fluid and flexible, contingent on the immediate needs of the public.
The company is the brainchild of U.S.-born co-founders Motti Sigel and Ilan Friedson, whose mobile application enables commuters to input their transportation requirements which are then fed through a back-end platform to public transit officials. They, in turn, relay the real-time data to drivers in order to most efficiently direct them to the customer.
Speaking to The Media Line, Sigel expanded on the concept: “The individual inserts his or her location, the destination, the time they would like to arrive and then the application provides them with transit options. When they select a ride, they get a commitment.

“We take that information, “he elaborated, “send it to the public transit companies and say we’ve now collected this person’s ride request and that person’s ride request. We then aggregate those and route the fleet of vehicles in order to enable those rides.”
The application incorporates the full spectrum of transit options, a multi-modality service that provides the times and expected fares for travel by car, bus, train, taxi—or a combination of  these elements—to get the individual from point A to point B in the fastest and most cost-effective manner.
“There is a win-win here,” Sigel explained, “for the public transit companies because their vehicles aren’t sitting idly in traffic unnecessarily or going to stops where nobody is waiting. This allows the operators to save quite a bit of money—as much as thirty percent of their total costs.
“As regards the rider, for the exact same reasons he or she can reduce their travel time by up to 15%.”
Sigel and Friedson both moved to Israel in their teens before eventually becoming roommates at Israel’s Technion, the premier technology institute in the country. At the time, Sigel, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the company, was studying mechanical engineering, whereas Friedson, the Chief Technology Officer, has a background in biotech.

The idea for the business was hatched one year ago, when Sigel was riding in an Uber between Teaneck, New Jersey and New York City.
Then, a lightbulb came on: Why has nobody done an Uber for public transit? He immediately called Friedson, who has half a decade of experience in big data and machine learning, to convey the idea.
“Well, maybe we should,” Friedson suggested in response; “so we have,” Sigel remarked with a grin.
Less than one year later, RouteValet is currently in negotiations with four transit operators with the goal of launching pilot programs next summer.
To introduce the concept, the company is targeting underserviced areas to begin with, gradually expanding into more densely populated areas as people adopt the product.
“This app takes into account the entire transportation system,” Friedson explained to The Media Line, “whereas other services only look at what’s best in terms of individual rides or an individual bus without considering the overall effects.
“Two weeks ago,” he continued, “University of California, Davis came out with a report showing that all these ride-sharing applications have actually increased traffic. By contrast, we take a top-down approach and in doing so everybody wins, even those who aren’t part of the app.”
To monetize the venture, the company will use the “credit card model,” earning a percentage of the revenue generated by the public transit operator from every route paid for by the end-user.
The Israeli-based start-up recently received a highly-coveted grant from the Chief Scientist of Israel—1 of only roughly 100 given out—and won a $10,000 euro prize in a prestigious competition run by the Ford Motor Company.

DRIVERLESS cars have gone from science fiction and fantasy to reality. Autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies are now reshaping societies, and they present strong business potential.
Carmakers and technology firms are in a race to develop AV technologies, and they have reached a level of advancement where some production cars are now equipped with driver assistance technology.
Tesla has produced vehicles with hardware ready for full autonomous driving capability. Audi recently launched its flagship model with conditional automated driving, where driver intervention is required under certain scenarios. These cars are expected to receive software updates over the next few years that could enable them to be fully autonomous in the near future.
However, there may be one decisive factor that determines the success of AV technologies – the built environment. In order to facilitate the deployment of driverless vehicles, cities must plan ahead and leverage AV technologies to work for their community, implement forward-thinking regulations and liability frameworks, and rethink how buildings are designed.
TRANSPORTATION DRIVES CITY DEVELOPMENT



 Throughout history, available modes of transportation for people and commerce drove the development of major cities and civilisations. Sometimes, the primary means of transport for commerce had a significant influence on the development of these cities.




 The expression “all roads lead to Rome” refers to the celebrated road system which radiated out from the city of Rome, the capital city of the Roman Empire – one of the largest empires in history, and among the most powerful economies of its time. Some of today’s largest cities such as London and New York developed on coasts with ships as the primary means of transport for commerce.

As a city-state, and a small island, Singapore’s conditions are unique. Apart from housing, social, recreational and business needs, accommodating a seaport and an airport on the island with limited land required careful planning. This led to a growth in infrastructure development for all three modes of transportation – land, sea and air.
THE FUTURE IS AUTONOMOUS
While the challenges that Singapore faces today are different from the past, the government’s priorities have been resolute: to provide for economic growth and quality living; maintain a clean and green environment, and sustainable use of limited resources.
A small country like Singapore faces the challenges of a growing population and limited land area. In addressing these concerns, analysts believe that driverless vehicles play a key role in shaping the future of the country’s transport landscape. Thus, the government has intensified its push towards AV transportation.
Self-driving taxis made their debut in Singapore last year, where members of the public who had registered for the test service were able to hail free rides in one-north via their smartphones. Since then, the AV trials have advanced to more on-road scenarios in an expanded test area. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) recently expanded the current AV test bed in one-north to include areas around the vicinity, hoping that this will help to accelerate the development of AV technologies.

While the development of an autonomous future for transportation in Singapore is gathering speed, the vision is much greater. “Smart Nation” is Singapore’s vision that involves the government, citizens and businesses in co-creating a future Singapore that would improve the quality of life through technology-enabled solutions.
One of the five key domains for this vision that will have a significant impact is transport involving AV technologies.
RESHAPING THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
The potential impact of the adoption of driverless cars is likely to influence commercial and residential real estate, in addition to industries such as insurance, car manufacturing and more. A report by Deloitte outlines the rapid expansion of shared mobility and AV initiatives as forces that are driving the transformation of transportation, real estate and area development in the near future.
It lists several scenarios and probable outcomes of the implementation of driverless cars that real estate developers and urban planners should study and plan for in the short and longer term.
A few examples discussed are: the experimenting of new policy instruments such as reducing the parking requirements in areas that are being (re)developed; the implications for real estate prices and the importance of location; a different city and road layout, and policy due to a potential decrease in parking and car ownership.
In the face of growing vehicle population and limited land for road expansion in Singapore, analysts envisage that increasing reliance on AVs will lead to a different approach to car ownership, and optimisation of road capacity.
These in turn have implications for the requirement of roads and how they are being laid out.
Among the most natural shifts we may see from driverless cars is the decrease in demand for parking space. If current trials and research and development of AVs are anything to go by, we can look forward to more energy-efficient vehicles that reduce congestion and the need for parking spaces.
As the need for parking lots wanes, some impacts on real estate planning are more immediately obvious.
Imagine underground parking spaces for commercial properties, and open air parking structures within residential estates that can be freed up and transformed for new purposes such as eateries, affordable housing and urban greenspace.
Real estate for the shipping and logistics sector could also be revolutionised by driverless trucks and drones.
More manufacturing and distribution property with less space dedicated to parking requirements could be built to help meet demand, as consumer goods become easier and faster to deliver as a result of AV technologies.
MORE THAN JUST VEHICLES
The future of Singapore’s transport system with AVs as the enabling technology could be a reality in 10 to 15 years, and the built environment must begin to adjust in anticipation. Analysts believe that the future land transport scene could be one where shared mobility such as buses and taxis are self-driving; and when fully integrated with mass public transport, commuting would be hassle-free and driving would be made redundant.

Regardless of how much AV technology will truly change our lives, the real estate industry is key in reshaping our cities and urban communities.
Developers and the authorities would need to work together on a long-term development strategy and policy to address Singapore’s priorities and unique set of challenges.
The shift is towards designing a city for the people, where AV technologies work for the community.

Recently, with the rise of bike sharing and other shared forms of transportation in major cities of China, car sharing has become a hot topic. Currently, car sharing is very promising in China for its efficiency and close relationship with the Internet industry.
Although the industry is far from mature, in the long run, China’s car-sharing development will greatly subvert the traditional automotive industry and lead to a new mode of daily travel.

Car sharing enjoys tremendous advantages in China. First, the rise of car sharing is an unstoppable trend.
Traffic congestion is now plaguing a number of cities in China, with 1.38 billion people owning 200 million cars. At present, the private car ownership in Beijing is 4.53 million.
According to the theory of the sharing economy, the effect of sharing one car is equivalent to eight private cars.
Theoretically, in this way less than 600,000 cars can solve the traffic demand of 4.5 million vehicles, and car ownership can be kept below 2 million.
Calculated another way, as the existing car ownership can’t be reduced, if we develop shared cars, we can use 200 million to 250 million shared cars to meet the equivalent traffic function of 800 million to 1.1 billion cars.
Also, at present, China is the world’s largest oil importer. In 2015, China’s reliance on imports for its oil needs exceeded 60 percent for the first time, and the apparent consumption of oil was estimated at 543 million tons.
If the average annual oil consumption of one car is 1.5 tons, 800 million to 1.1 billion car ownership will require an increase in annual oil imports of 900 million to 1.5 billion tons.
This is almost impossible. Car sharing can be developed to solve these problems.
Second, car sharing will be a travel innovation. The current trip modes are either collective, using public transport means (bus, long-distance bus, train and aircraft) or individual trips using private transport means (private cars, electric bicycles and bicycles).
Between them are taxis, rental cars and online car-hailing, all of which involve using other people’s vehicles for individual trips.
Car-hailing has encountered many constraints, such as cities that require local household registration and vehicle license to offer such rides and higher costs than normal taxis and shared cars. Thus, car sharing has more potential to become popular.
Car sharing is a personalized trip in such aspects as including networks, customization and interconnection. People will no longer need their own transport means to undertake personalized travel.
Car sharing can meet the needs of multidimensional demand with less traffic congestion and energy consumption.
Third, Chinese Internet companies are eager to promote the development of car sharing. A number of Internet companies are now developing new cars, new sharing models and technology that will affect the traditional vehicle industry.

Google, Baidu and other companies are developing autonomous vehicles, claiming that the cars won’t be sold to individuals but will provide sharing services.
These companies may not build a car manufacturing plant, but they will use the Apple model. Many traditional car companies are also developing new-energy vehicles, autonomous cars and car-sharing models to avoid being overthrown.
Internet companies and automobile makers are exploring ways to cooperate, which to me is one of the best ways. Both sides should jointly promote the car-sharing industry.
However, the sector is still at the beginning stage, and many problems wait to be solved such as the management of conflicts, security, parking and vandalism.
To solve this problem we must improve the relevant laws. For example, the regulations ought to clearly delineate responsibility when it comes to accidents involving shared cars.
We should vigorously promote network regulation, which means that vehicles’ locations, driving conditions and the driver’s conditions can all be recorded and evaluated.
This will reduce the rate of accidents. Finally, vehicle testing, maintenance, parking and the construction of charging facilities are all important issues.

Carsharing Market analysis & Growth
The latest carsharing industry analysis provided by UC Berkley’s TSRC show that in October 2016 carsharing was operational on all continents except Antarctica. TSRC estimated that there were carsharing organizations in 2,095 cities worldwide. Fleet size was globally over 157,000 vehicles and about 15 million members are registered. Asia is by far the largest carsharing region with over 40% of all carsharing vehicles operating there. Europe is the second largest carsharing market with 37% of the global fleet deployed in that region.
Station-based/Round-trip carsharing (like Zipcar, Communauto or Maven) still account for the majority of all fleets while free-floating (such as car2go, Gig or DriveNow) is a growing segment. Estimates on the split between station-based and free-floating vary slightly depending on which research we have looked at, but generally station-based hovers between 74 – 83% and free-floating between 17 – 26%. In Oceania, however, the relation is reversed: almost 80% of vehicles there were part of a free-floating fleet.
An important point to note is that free-floating has seen tremendous growth on the membership as well as fleet side over the past few years. Overall membership for free-floating has increased by 76% (!) which we at movmi attribute to the low barrier of entry. Free-floating providers in general do not charge recurring membership fees but are setup as pay-as-you-go models. Peer-to-peer fleets and membership has also experienced tremendous growth in the past years. Susan Shaheen’s team has found that between January 2016 and January 2017 the fleet has increased by 80% and membership has more than doubled.

Current forecasts by various different consulting agencies (GMI, Frost & Sullivan, Report Buyer or McKinsey) all predict market growth for 2025: fleet size will increase almost 4x and be at around 427,000. Membership overall will increase 5x and about 36 million people will be subscribed to one or multiple carsharing services.
Carsharing Key Players To Watch
Player A: car2go
Daimler was the first organization to offer free-floating carsharing world wide and on a global scale. It was founded in 2008 and currently offers service in 26 cities, the majority in North America (42%) and Europe (54%) and 1 city in China (4%). car2go used to run an additional 11 cities that were all shut down for different reasons between 2014 and 2016. car2go’s total fleet size is just under 14,000 vehicles and almost twice as big as the next biggest  competitor: BMW’s DriveNow/ReachNow program.
Three of the European cities are all-electric: Stockholm, Madrid and Stuttgart all have enough infrastructure to sustain an all electric free-floating fleet.
Competitors such as EVO have since entered the market, which influenced car2go to offer more, larger vehicle types than its Smart Fortwo. Depending on the market, the fleet consists of Smart Fortwo, Smart ForFour, A- and B-class as well as CLA and GLA.
In July 2017, car2go announced that it had just registered its 2.5 millionth member. Again this is by far the largest carsharing membership base: it is 2.5 times larger than BMW’s program. It took Zipcar (station-based competitor) 16 years to sign up 1 million members. While Zipcar was the forerunner for car2go and paved the way on carsharing awareness, there are two other reasons why car2go was able to sign up at a much faster rate and in larger numbers:
1) there is no membership fee associated with becoming part of the program
2) the registration process is fully automated (including driver’s license and credit card
checks)
Player B DriveNow/ReachNow
BMW was the second car manufacturer that invested in carsharing, in particular in a B2C free-floating program. In Europe BMW’s program is called DriveNow, in North America ReachNow. The main difference is the technology stack supporting each of the regions, the North American operations is powered by Ridecell whereas Europe runs on Sixt’s platform. Combined DriveNow/ReachNow offer over 7,600 vehicles in 14 cities: the majority in Europe (only Seattle and Portland are operated in North America). ReachNow used to operate in Brooklyn but closed that city in May 2018 because of high operational costs (vehicle damage). DriveNow was founded in 2011 and 6 years later they announced that they have 1 million members signed up for the program.
Interestingly enough, Daimler and BMW have agreed to combine their mobility services in April 2018. The decision is pending the examination and approval by the responsible competition authorities but if approved both parties will hold a 50% stake in the joint-venture. The new organization will focus on providing service in car-sharing, ride-hailing, parking, charging and multimodality. The main goal is to become the leading provider of mobility services, especially to be competitive with well-backed competitors such as Uber or Didi. The two groups will most likely also combine some of their operational efforts for cost-savings.
Player C Maven
Maven is a new station-based initiative launched in 2016 and backed by General Motors. Maven is noteworthy because they have already expanded to 10 cities in the US and launched their first Canadian city in February 2018. Being a station-based provider, Maven’s fleet launches are much smaller than their free-floating competitors. For instance, Maven launched with only 40 vehicles in Toronto. Having said that Maven’s model has huge potential especially for large, very densely populated cities with a functioning public transit system. Members use the cars to do errands or leave the city, in particular during the summer months. The convenience of Maven’s user experience has allowed Maven to sign up over 15,000 members in its first year of operation in New York.
While Maven is nowhere close to the size and scale of the biggest station-based provider Zipcar, we believe that GM offers the financial backing and a strategic vision of how to tie Maven together with other shared mobility services (such as ridehailing) that will grow this carsharing service significantly over the next few years.
Player D Turo
Peer-to-peer carsharing (P2P) is much more common in the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and other parts of Europe, but it is the fastest growing carsharing business model in the United States. Turo is the biggest of the six P2P providers in North America. Turo, originally operated as RelayRides, allows owners to rent out their vehicles through an online portal or Turo’s app. In 2015 RelayRides rebranded to Turo in an attempt to position itself more as a long-term rental and travel service. The rebranding has been very successful and in 2017 Turo announced that they have 170,000 privately owned vehicles on their platform and four million members. As of 2016 they have expanded outside the United States to Canada and later the same year to the UK. In January 2018, they announced expansion to Germany. Turo has been viewed as one of the hottest transportation startups, f.i. by Forbes in 2015 with a valuation of $311 million.
Part of Turo’s success is because they have managed to partner with large car manufacturers such as GM or secure funding from that industry (f.i. Daimler in 2017). The other part is an extremely simple user experience for the owner of the vehicles: there is no hardware installation required (unlike many other P2P providers such as Getaround, Sharoo etc), a smaller commission compared to the competiton (10-35%) that corresponds with the driver’s choice of the amount of Turo insurance coverage they’d like and the ability of the owner to set their own rental prices.
Carsharing Market Breakdown by Region
In this next section we will be looking at the three major carsharing regions and their growth potential: North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. This will be followed by a short overview over Latin America and the MEA regions.
North America Carsharing Market
North America is the third largest carsharing market globally (behind Asia and Europe) and both fleet and membership has grown significantly since 2010. Fleets increased by more than 2.5 times and membership by 3.5 times between 2010 and 2016.

UNITED STATES
Market Size & Growth
CAGR Estimates of carsharing growth in the US hover around 17% for fleet and membership in the next 7 years. Part of this growth has to do with several incentives that the U.S. government has already introduced. Some of these incentives are on municipal levels (see the Shared Mobility City Index for details on 15 US cities) others have been introduced by different states. State legislations generally focus on car sharing taxation and incentives for using car sharing fleets. Examples are tax credits (Washington state), special programs that increase co-location between transit hubs and carsharing locations (California) or partnerships between public transit operators and carsharing providers (Oregon), and in particular special carsharing parking
permits (several states) .
￼￼
Canada
While Canada is the smaller market compared to the US, its population is located mainly in metropolitan areas (over 85%) and boasts some of the most vibrant carsharing markets. This is why some CAGR estimates for fleet and members are closer to 20-23%. An example of a flourishing carsharing market is Vancouver: it has four operators (2 station-based and 2 free-floating) and citizens have access to a fleet of almost 3,000 vehicles. As of 2016, almost 1/3 of Vancouver’s adult population had one or more carsharing memberships. That’s approximately 200,000 people.

Opportunities
For both countries, we expect an increase in state and municipal incentives, especially also around programs that encourage electric and carsharing in lower income neighbourhoods or more rural areas.
In fact, last month (April 2018) the City of Los Angeles in partnership with French Bolloré group has launched an all-electric carsharing operations where vehicles are strategically parked in low income neighbourhoods. The company expects to have 100 vehicles available at 40 locations by the end of the year, and to triple in size by 2021. Another program, which is currently in BETA stage, is Hui in Hawaii. Hui solves the transportation challenges of Honolulu, a city with less dense public transit infrastructure compared to some of the typical carsharing markets (Paris, London, New York). It’s a partnership between Toyota and a large dealer network (Servco). Using dealers to operate carsharing fleets allows for a unique setup which will create new opportunities in smaller and more rural communities.
Europe Carsharing Market Analysis
Europe is the second largest carsharing market globally (behind Asia) partly due to its densely populated cities and partly because the European Union has put a high focus on the adoption of green technologies and reducing GHG emissions. This has resulted in an explosion of operators and fleets. In 2016, 3.5 times as many carsharing vehicles were available to Eureopeans compared to 2010. It also has resulted in an incredible growth of memberships (eight-fold between 2010 and 2016).

Source Shaheen 2018 Spring Carsharing Outlook
UK
CAGR estimates of carsharing growth in the UK are between 18-20% for fleet and membership in the next 7 years. Part of this growth has to do with infrastructure improvements for broadband networks and a very unstable economy that results in people looking for alternatives to owning a vehicle.
Carplus is a UK based not-for-profit, environmental transport NGO working for accessible shared mobility and has led a number of initiatives in the past several years to promote carsharing.

Carplus is managing a Department of Transport funded programme to develop over twenty new or expanded car club projects across England (started in 2014);
Establishing the Developing Car Clubs in Scotland programme on behalf of Transport Scotland in November 2010. We have supported the expansion of the network from 3 car clubs in 2010 to 16 car clubs in 20 communities (as at January 2014);
Delivery of an additional £1m funding for electric vehicles in the Scottish car club fleet through the Transport Scotland funded DCCS programme;
Delivery of Transport for London’s Car Club Strategy (published in 2008) and supporting its implementation in London (2008 to date)

Opportunities
With over 40 different car clubs (carsharing organizations) operating in the UK, there are two opportunities that are being explored more frequently:
1. A focus on providing mobility credits for businesses Instead of providing employees with company vehicles, many car clubs offer their vehicles to employees of large corporations. For instance, Ubeeqo, a provider operating in London, offers mobility credits that employees can use when booking carsharing vehicles.
2. MaaS (Mobility as a Service) With more shared mobility providers launching in the UK (carsharing, bikesharing, ridehailing etc), integrating the different services for ease of use for members becomes crucial. As of April 2018, Birmingham is the first UK city offering Whim, a multimodal transportation app, created by the Helsinki-based technology company MaaS Global. MaaS Global is working in partnership with the West Midlands Combined Authority.
Germany
Estimates for growth for Germany are a little bit higher than the UK (CAGR for fleet and members between 21-23%). This is not surprising knowing that Germany currently is the biggest European carsharing market. At the beginning of 2018, more than 2 million people were subscribed to a carsharing service and more than 677 cities and communities offer a carsharing service (80 more than in 2017).

Source BCS, Bundesverband Carsharing
There a few major reasons why Germany has adopted carsharing so quickly. One major factor is because some of the largest car manufacturers introduced their own carsharing offerings (Daimler, BMW). Another major factor included Germany offering a unique regulatory framework that supports clean energy solutions. In 2017 the German Bundestag has approved a so-called Carsharing Law: for the first time regulating the establishment of parking spaces specifically for car-sharing on a Germany-wide basis. The law makes it incredibly easy to obtain public parking spaces for fixed-location provision of car-sharing and allows local authorities to reduce or waive parking fees for car-sharing vehicles.
Opportunities
Introducing large-scale electric carsharing fleets is one of the bigger opportunities in Germany with the ongoing investigations into diesel scandals. Currently 10% of German’s carsharing fleets consist of electric vehicles. While this is, in fact, 100 times bigger than for personally owned vehicles, Gunnar Nehrke, President of the German Carsharing Association believes that there is potential for more. However, he also states that support programs and incentives of the German state are needed to increase the economic viability of electric vehicles in carsharing fleets.
France
Growth potential for France is in similar ranges as for Germany, however France is a particularly hot market for peer-to-peer. Drivy is France’s version of Turo and highly successful; in fact, France is the most successful P2P market in all of Europe with over 1 million users. Another large provider of carsharing services in France is Réseau Citiz” who operate in over 80 cities (18 different local providers). It is beneficial to be a local organization in France because the country is particularly strict in its carsharing regulations, especially for free-floating vehicles. They all must be fully electric or at least hybrid vehicles.
Opportunities
Similar to Germany the introduction of large-scale electric carsharing fleets is a big opportunity in France. If an operator meets this condition (EV/hybrid fleet), it is very easy for them to obtain the necessary parking permits. However, the challenges are also similar, only cities with sufficient infrastructure are feasible and financially viable for that model.
Asia Pacific Carsharing Market Analysis
As of 2016, Asia is the largest carsharing market world-wide. Furthermore, the fleet size has more than tripled in only a 2 year period, from 2014 to 2016. Membership is at a staggering 8.7 million, double of European numbers. Rapid industrialization and urbanization were major factors that fueled this growth. In addition to that countries such as Taiwan and India have underdeveloped transportation infrastructure and high air pollution (China). The first means that Asian Pacific countries are undertaking very stringent controls on personal vehicle ownership. The latter is pushing governements in these regions towards using their road network more efficiently and adding more EVs. Combined it provides fertile ground for carsharing which is a more efficient ways of utilizing vehicles.

China Market Size & Growth
China’s carsharing fleet and membership are poised for more growth. Roland Berger, a German consulting firm that has researched carsharing for years, estimates an annual growth rate of 45% by 2025. Despite this huge growth prediticion, China remains a challenging market to enter, especially for foreign operators. There are several initial conditions to be met to launch a carsharing business in China: none of them are easily achieved, especially in cities with strict license plate restrictions and parking lot shortages. Unsurprisingly, 90% of all carsharing organizations in China are operated locally. Chinese operated carsharing providers can be split into three groups: OEM self-owned, third party backed by OEMs and third party technology companies. For instance Didi Chuxing, China’s biggest ridehailing, AV and transportation AI technology company, has launched electric carsharing services with a dozen car manufacturers (some local, some international). Most of the carshare operators in China rely on government subsidies and exclusive partnerships which help them gain an initial foothold in the market before establishing a more profitable business model.
Opportunities
China is a prime candidate for electric carsharing for two different reasons:
1. The Chinese government is targeting 2 million EV sales in 2020 and their strategy of incentives as well as restrictions on gasoline-car purchases seems to be paying off: in the first quarter of 2018, roughly half of all global EVs were sold in China.
2. In addition to that China heavily invest into building out electric charing infrastructure. By 2020, the government estimates that 10,000 charging stations will be active.
India Market Size & Growth
India’s shared transportation industry is not as attractive as China’s and it is also not as well reserached. However, it is also well positioned for growth. Industry experts estimate annual growth rates for fleet and membership base to be around 25%. The main drivers for these changes are the headaches of owning a vehicle and finding parking in metropolises such as Mumbai or Bangalore. The residents are looking for more comfort and convenience while saving costs.
Opportunities
The biggest opportunity in India lies in electric ridehailing. All major players in the region (Ola, Uber and Didi) are all heavily investing into electric fleets in an attempt to combat some of the regions Smog problems.
Latin America Carsharing Market Analysis
Latin America’s carsharing fleet and membership has grown steadily over the past 4 years, however it is far behind the top three markets. It is interesting to note that in 2016 all providers in South America operated a station-based model, generally a model that shows lower adoption rates than free-floating ones. Brazil and Mexico have extremely densely populated cities and a high rate of urbanization. With these factors, this results in more people needing to commute to and from work which worsens congestion. In addition, many people do not own vehicles letting them have more disposable income (mainly in Mexico) which makes the region fertile for carsharing growth. However, economic issues are abound and currency instability, such as the Argentinan peso dropping rapidly, has deterred many foreign operators to invest in this volatile market.

MEA
The Middle East and Africa are generally completely neglected by carsharing researchers and growth estimates (if they exist) are in the lower end of the spectrum. Investment from the government in smart transportation (f.i. Next) and an increase in number of inquiries on movmi’s side from this region indicates that experts estimates are most likely too conservative.
The United Arab Emirates have experienced significant growth in carsharing since 2016. In January 2017, the Roads and Transport Authority in Dubai announced that it had contracted U Drive and Ekar to operate 200 vehicles for smart rental services. A little bit over a year into operations, both organizations have experienced growth in their membership and fleets. Ekar aims to have 500 to 600 cars on the road by Ramadan, while Udrive is targeting 1,000 by the end of 2018 or start of 2019. Ekar’s membership base is at about 50,000. Part of the success is a high level of technology savviness of UAE consumers, a large portion of the population that is transient and excessive costs of maintaining a vehicle.
The increased focus of the Emirate government to create alternative forms of transportation to ease congestion and GHG emission issues also helps with market growth.
Another market to keep an eye on is Africa, in particular South Africans seems to have an increased appetite for smart shared mobility solutions to save cost. However only a local operator, Locomute, offers services. The extremely high crime rates means this market will most likely stay on the slow lane for a while longer.
New Trends in the Carsharing Industry
So where are the big opportunities in the growing carsharing market? We predict that the three trends outlined below will create more growth for carsharing operators and increase fleet and customer size globally.
Electrification of Carsharing
Governments across the globe are putting regulations and incentives in place to increase electric vehicle usage overall to reduce GHG emissions. Carsharing fleets generally have high interest in adding electric vehicles because it often allows them to gain access to special parking permits or special governemental subsidies. In addition to that carsharing consumers adopt electric vehicles quicker because pricing for EVs or a traditional combustion engine vehicles are the same. They also appreciate the positive impact their choices make on the environment.
From an operational perspective, governments, municipalities and utility providers need to invest in large scale charging infastructure coverage if EV carsharing is to become profitable and not dependant on governement grants or subsidies. The European and Chinese markets are ahead in that respect compared to the rest of the world and we expect some lighthouse projects out of these areas.
Focus Shift From High Population Density Cities To Low Population Density Cities
In North America large parts of the US and Canada are sparsely populated and organizations (public transit and private shared mobility operators) are experimenting with different setups of carsharing. Experiments currently include: offering the service through dealership networks, through peer-to-peer carsharing or by subsidizing existing operators (ridehailing or carsharing) to provide service in more rural areas. This makes sense knowing that smaller communities don’t receive the same amount of public transit funding yet still would like to offer their residents the ability to move around easily. We believe there will be more innovative approaches to providing transportation options in cities like Innisfil.
From an operational perspective, advances in big data analytics and algorithms for real-time and flexible operations will support this type of disruption of the current status quo.
Aggreation, Integration and MaaS
In larger cities that are reaching a state of saturation with several different carsharing providers (especially in Europe but to a smaller extent also in North America), aggregation and integration of the services becomes crucial. Customers do not want to register with several different providers and load multiple apps to find the fastest way from A to B. The increase in competition will create more incentives to partner up and create synergies. Good examples are the BMW/Daimler merger or Uber’s venturing into carsharing/bikesharing in recent months.
In addition public transit providers and municipalities are increasingly open to evaluating MaaS options for their citizen. Mobility-as-a-Service, means fully integrated mobility, as well as integrated public transit in even the largest, most bustling cities. The goal is a seamless user experience which could increase the number of people forgoing vehicle ownership because MaaS offers the same convenience and freedom. The jury is still out on who the final MaaS operator and provider will be: it could either be the public transit authority which would ensure transportation equity for everyone. Or it could be the private sector who would certainly be much faster in innovating.
While carsharing has grown over the past several years at an increased pace, movmi believes that we’re only at the beginning. The global fleet size is a fraction of all vehicles registered and so is the member base. The international giants such as car2go/DriveNow, Uber or Turo will grow even further and smaller operators will create new solutions for smaller communities, niche markets or demographic segments.
“To date, we have only figured out how to create successful carsharing operations for densely populated cities and a very specific user demographic: young professionals with a higher education and an above average income level. However an increased demand in more flexible and affordable mobility options offers new and exciting opportunities for mobility operators,” believes Phillips.

Many of Europe’s fastest-growing cities are also the least affordable and face connectivity challenges. Though longer commute times alone can be a sign of a city’s appeal, metropolitan areas have to fix their traffic problems in order to prepare for the future.
“The best-connected cities will win,” Chris Choa, a vice president at AECOM focused on cities and urban development, said at the recent ULI Netherlands Conference in Amsterdam.
Throughout history, Choa said, successful cities have grown as wide as the distance that can be traveled in one hour. Before the Industrial Revolution, Paris and Rome were six kilometers (3.7 miles) wide—about an hour’s walk.
Now, London might be 60 kilometers (37 miles) across, but that is about an hour’s travel by train, Choa said; likewise, driving the highways of sprawling Detroit takes an hour by car.
The biggest cities will keep getting bigger: in 2016, there were 30 megacities—cities of 10 million or more—which will become 41 megacities by 2030, with most of the growth coming in Asia. Measured by population density, the United States has just six or seven metropolitan areas with urban cores, Choa said. As urbanization continues, traffic problems will only get worse.

Many speakers agreed that using land exclusively for parking is not effective. Every car requires at least three parking spots—at home, at work, and at any third location the driver visits. In London, 9 million parking spaces take up a total of 22,500 hectares (87 square miles), or 14 percent of its total area. If a city was able to free up all that land, what could it do with it? Choa said some neighborhoods are starting to experiment with banning automobile traffic and reclaiming parking spaces.
In addition, private cars are idle more than 90 percent of the time. Niek van Leeuwen, Uber’s general manager for Benelux, argued that ridesharing can enhance mass transit systems. If the 1 billion cars in the world are regarded as public goods rather than private goods, congestion and pollution in cities could be reduced.
Many people use ridesharing in conjunction with traditional public transportation. In Amsterdam, 25 percent of Uber rides start or end near public transit stops during rush hours, van Leeuwen said. In San Francisco, more than 50 percent of riders use Uber Pool because it is more affordable and has the benefit of moving more people with fewer cars.
Millennials are less likely to own a car than their parents or grandparents. In the United Kingdom, Uber partnered with a developer working on a residential project without many parking spaces, van Leeuwen said. Residents were offered £100 (US$130) of free Uber rides per month to any resident who did not want a parking space.
Cities will navigate their possibilities differently, said Phillip Bouteiller of the Tegel Project in Berlin. Driverless cars could change the status of automobiles. Private autonomous mobility could emerge in areas of urban sprawl, and seamless mobility could emerge in densely developed areas. Mercedes and German engineering company Bosch are trying to bring autonomous taxis to market by 2020, joining Ford, BMW, and General Motors in the race to be first to market.
Autonomous vehicles cannot totally replace public mass transportation, Bouteiller said. “Mass transport in the future will be rails, full stop,” he said. The efficiency of trains on tracks, whether underground, on street level, or elevated, is unparalleled by any other mode of transportation. But he thinks inner-city movement could become much more flexible in the future, perhaps in the form of autonomous eight-seat buses—a middle ground between traditional buses and taxis.
In any case, the current reliance on cars is going to change. “Using four wheels to get into a city is two wheels too much,” said Raymond Gense, managing director of Next Urban Mobility, an Amsterdam-based startup. He believes multimodal mobility hubs will be the new entrance points for cities. An example would be a train station with connections to buses and local trains, as well as ride-sharing opportunities, bicycle stations, and charging stations for electric cars. Amsterdam ran out of bicycle parking spaces in 2015 and is scrambling to add 25,000 more near the main train station by 2030.
Mobility hubs would also be appropriate for residential buildings, where residents can get access to charging stations, bike parking, car parking, car sharing, and rental cars. “Citizens must be willing to share, and real estate developers have to look ahead,” Gense said.

Commuters across Middle Tennessee are jumping on a new trend during their ride to work by earning money to ride together.
An app called Hytch Rewards is changing the way Nashvillians drive to and from work by putting money in their pockets.
Hytch Rewards pays you for every mile you drive with at least one other person. And, you don’t have to be in your car. You can earn rewards for taking an Uber with a friend or riding the bus.

The app was designed with the goal of getting cars off the road and conserving emissions.
Several local businesses are sponsoring rides to and from work for at least 5 cents a mile.
“It just seems logical that there’s a million empty seats driving in Nashville every day. We have what I would call a micro mass transit system. Every time you’re driving down the road and you’re by yourself, you’re moving, and if you think about it, you could be – just with a tiny bit more effort – you could be bringing someone to work or sharing a ride anywhere,” said co-founder and CEO Mark Cleveland.
At Lipscomb University, administrators have reserved half of the first floor of the parking garage for students who carpool using Hytch. Not only are students getting paid to drive to school with a friend, but they’re also getting parking perks.
After your ride is finished, the app will tell you how many rides you’ve taken, how far you’ve gone, how much you’ve earned and how many trees you’ve saved.
Cleveland says one of the coolest things about the technology is that it’s building communities. People who have never spoken to each other on transit systems have now exchanged phone numbers so they can use Hytch in big groups on their commute.
News4 asked Cleveland about the transit plan that recently failed to pass in Nashville and what was missing.
“What was missing? I can’t emphasize enough – incentives is what’s missing. If you want to increase ridership, you need to think about incentives. Just imagine an airline program that doesn’t have a frequent flyer reward program. There are none,” Cleveland said.
Since February, more than 1 million miles have been driven around Middle Tennessee using Hytch. This is about 90 days at an average of 25,000 carpooled miles per day.

India’s quest for smart mobility has made the country a hot spot for international companies to offer their latest technologies such as pod taxis, hyperloop, electric vehicles, cable cars and ropeways.
One such firm, skyTran, is a Nasa technology partner and is developing a pod car system—a driverless vehicle that runs along a pre-determined route.
The company has shown interest in building a 1km pilot track in India at its own cost to showcase its technology. According to skyTran, its product can be used as a mass rapid transit system, transporting people at 120km per hour for inter-city commuting and at 200-250km per hour for intra-city travel.

Virgin Hyperloop One, formerly Hyperloop One, founded in 2014 and headquartered in Los Angeles, also plans to set up its low pressure or vacuum tubes, which could help move freight and people through magnetically levitated pod-like vehicles, at a speed of 1,000-1,200km per hour.
The credit for the interest shown by overseas tech majors goes to minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari, who had decided to experiment with new and faster technologies for transportation from the time he assumed office in 2014.
Since then, several key initiatives, such as a new mode of transportation from Gurugram to Manesar, ethanol-based fuels for buses, the idea to convert India’s four-wheeler fleet to electric, were lined up.
Gadkari’s definition of smart mobility is “fast and green”. “I want to change the mobility experience in India. We are looking for different solutions and I am open to new ideas and experiments, provided they are environment-friendly and cheap so that masses can use it.”
Gadkari says his parliamentary constituency, Nagpur city, is a test case where he had tried to showcase several new smart mobility initiatives, including electric taxis and ethanol-based public buses.
While new technologies are lining up to align themselves to smart mobility, old tech like cable cars,  ropeways are also back in the limelight–
“Nothing is impossible,” he says.
 
A government official, who did not want to be identified, said smart mobility is still evolving in India.
“It is a gamut of things and includes smart transportation solutions from taxis to buses, etc… It is also about how you access the services—through mobiles applications or websites. For vehicle owners, it could also be about how you travel on road, how you pay toll electronically, or get SMS alerts on the time taken to reach your destination, and even book a parking space before you reach there.”
However, he points out that India’s mobility business is steadily becoming smart and green.
The official cited several examples such as FASTag, introduced by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), or toll rates based on the distance travelled on national highways, SMS alerts about traffic status on national highways, smart cards for metros and other public transportations, as the means to moving towards smart mobility.
Mobile applications for taxi aggregators such as Ola and Uber and online booking of bus tickets are also helping India move towards the same goal.
The government official said India’s decision of mass transit to electric mobility will also be driving green mobility.

“With a strong leader like Gadkari, who changed the automobile sector’s complete game plan by introducing a mass shift to electric vehicles, at the helm, technologies such as pod taxis and hyperloop can be witnessed soon,” the official said.
While the new technologies are lining up to align themselves to smart mobility, interestingly, old technologies like cable cars and ropeways are also back in the limelight.
Vikram Singhal, who heads Indian operations of European company Doppelmayr, says cable cars or ropeways are no more limited to tourist destinations, but are also emerging as the best non-vehicular transportation solutions for de-congesting cities, where space is a big constraint.
In fact, UN-Habitat (United Nations Human Settlement Programme) has also recognized cable cars as environmentally and socially sustainable non-vehicular solution for transportation.
Over the last few months, state governments have also been showing interest to adopt cable cars as a smart mobility solution.
While Uttarakhand is planning to connect its two famous towns of Dehradun and Mussoorie using cable cars, which would reduce travel time from three hours to 20 minutes, Maharashtra is looking at India’s first ropeway on the Arabian Sea, connecting Mumbai with the Elephanta Caves.
The project is being conceived and undertaken by the Mumbai Port Trust.
Similarly, Gujarat is building a cable car way at Girnar, while Goa is constructing a ropeway to connect Panaji and Reis Magos, on two ends of the Mandovi river.
“India had not looked at cable cars as a mass transportation system so far. But there are different ways it can support, including as a last-mile connectivity with metros or travel from one city to another in case of hilly terrains,” said Singhal of Doppelmayr, adding that cable car costs 60-70% less than metros, and the projects can be finished in two years without disturbing normal traffic.

Whilst ‘sharing economy‘ is not a new concept, digital formats, alongside the rapid expansion of the online ecosystem, have led to an exponential increase in the sharing of physical goods, space, skills, and resources.

Juniper’s sharing economy research offers comprehensive coverage and insight into this rapidly growing marketplace, alongside expert analysis of the monetisation strategies, key player opportunities, and future developments.
The research provides an assessment of the core sectors of this industry including:

Shared transport
Space
Services
Money (crowdfunding)
Logistics
Manufacturing, agriculture, and B2B services

Juniper has identified three key sectors ripe for disruption namely, shared transport, shared logistics, and shared space.
The research company forecasts that the sharing economy will reach $40.2bn in 2022, in terms of platform provider revenues, up from $18.6bn in 2017.
Transport
Whilst many traditional taxi services now offer apps for bookings etc, for the purposes of this research Juniper only focusses on private vehicles being used to disrupt the ridesharing industry, with drivers seen as contractors rather than employees.




Research reveals key drivers of sharing economy
A new whitepaper reveals the key drivers of the ever growing sharing economy, outlining the challenges and future opportunities surrounding it…
The company has found that since its last research report (compiled in early 2016), shared transport companies are on average taking closer to 30% of driver earnings, with the largest market being North America, where Uber dominates its closest rival Lyft, earning nine times more per annum. Drivers in the US can expect to get an average fare of $14.39 per journey this year, before platform providers take their cut.




Uber had revenues of $3.4bn in Q1 2017 alone. However, there are a number of other car sharing, or transport application startups vying for market share.
Logistics
 
Whilst previously local delivery in the sharing economy had very much focused on the delivery of more traditional mail packages, the growth subsector over the past year has been restaurant and takeaway food delivery.
A number of larger corporations and operators in other sectors of the sharing economy have invested resources in the shared delivery space, in an attempt to either make an early push into this sector, or to utilise infrastructure which they already have in place.
Space
The sharing of residential properties has been increasingly popular over the past four to five years and much of this relates to the success of Airbnb, which launched in 2008.
Juniper forecasts that the corporate space sector is set for significant growth over the next five years as more large office properties sell hundreds of desks at a time. The company expects almost 60,000 locations to be used for shared office space by the end of 2017. Until now, the process has been very much set on offering 5-20 spare desks in established offices.

We often get asked questions from urban planners, policymakers, and real estate professionals asking how they should prepare for the future of mobility, today. Some are architects and developers wanting to know how their buildings and planned communities should be designed in a shared automated future. Some are planners and policymakers wanting to know if and how their zoning and building codes should be amended to prepare.
In an automated future, cities could change in three fundamental ways:

The density of urban centers is likely to increase, as shared automated vehicles impact reliance on private vehicle ownership and use. Even if privately owned, automated vehicles would no longer need to be parked in a city’s highest valued real estate. Instead, these vehicles could self-drive and park away from residential, employment, and other activity centers. As such, auto-oriented land uses, such as parking, gas stations, and auto dealerships, could be redeveloped into housing, offices, and other land uses following principles of highest and best use. The four criteria guiding the highest and best use of real estate are: 1) legal permissibility, 2) physical possibility, 3) financial feasibility, and 4) maximum productivity.
Suburban and exurban areas are likely to expand, particularly in regions with high costs of living and a lack of affordable housing. With telecommuting growth, fewer work days in the office, and automated vehicles, longer commutes could become less of an impediment. Vehicle automation has the potential to transform commutes from lost driving time into productive hours that could be spent working, relaxing, or resting.
A reduction in parking is likely, although estimating the precise reduction is difficult and will likely be regional based on automated vehicle ownership rates, the built environment and walkability of a city, and the availability of high quality public transportation and on-demand mobility options. Parking is a very expensive addition to most real estate projects, and the vast majority is unpaid with no return on investment. A reduction in parking demand can free up land and capital to make other property improvements, such as increased density and public spaces.

To prepare for the impact of automated vehicles on real estate, designing for adaptable parking infrastructure that can be repurposed, renovated, or redeveloped in the future is key.
While the industry may not be ready to remove parking for automated vehicles today, the ability to repurpose, renovate, and redevelop in the future starts with thoughtful planning today. The ability to adapt parking in the future is critical for two reasons:

Planning for parking adaptability can extend the economic lifespan of a property or a development project, and
It reduces the potential for future grayfield sites and makes such sites easier to improve, revitalize, and redevelop with minor modifications and capital expenditures.

Plainly stated, parking adaptability has the potential to minimize and mitigate future grayfield blight due to an over supply of underused parking in the future. Architects, engineers, and developers should design for adaptable parking today. And cities should require it as part of local building codes. Here are some tips that can be incorporated into parking and facility design today to help ensure flexibility in transitioning to a shared electric connected and automated vehicle future.
 
Recommendations for Residential Design
A number of strategies exist to help make residential garages more adaptable to renovation. Designing for future utility requirements, such as heating, ventilation, and cooling, as well as fire exits is key. Additionally, local governments should consider potential zoning and building code amendments to accommodate the renovation of garages into single housing units (with a separate kitchen, laundry, and full bathroom). Allowing for these types of conversions could increase the overall housing supply, enhance affordability (both by increasing supply and creating a rental unit), and increase suburban residential density.
 
Recommendations for Structured Parking Design
Similarly, a number of strategies exist to make structured parking more adaptable to repurposing, renovation, and redevelopment. Developers and facility managers in need of more parking for a limited period of time could consider modular parking systems designed to be moved, reconfigured, or deconstructed for other uses. One company, MORE PARK, offers a modular structure that installs over existing surface parking in just a few weeks. This could provide an option for sites that need more parking today without the permanence of a traditional parking structure and the flexibility to quickly convert a parcel for future development.
In addition to interim modular parking facilities, developers and facility managers constructing new structured parking today, should consider:

Designing parking structures for future conversion that allows for minimal modification without impacting key structural elements, such as columns, beams, and floor plates;
People do not want to live or work in a parking garage with really low vertical clearance. Designing parking structures to consider future physical space requirements, such as floor-to-floor heights, column spacing, and utility requirements, including heating, ventilation, and cooling. In particular column spacing and floor-to-floor heights are critical. Architects and engineers should consider increasing floor to ceiling heights on the ground floor to match nearby storefronts and allow for ground level uses requiring greater vertical clearances, such as lobbies; and
Designing and constructing level floors and considering potential design amenities, such as the availability and location of utility hookups.

 
Parking today should be viewed as open buildings in prime locations for low cost, transformative development in the future. Both residential garages and structured parking should be designed with flexibility in mind to accommodate transitions to “live-work” land uses.
 
To plan for the transition to automated vehicles, cities and county governments should develop building and zoning codes that not only accommodate adaptable parking but encourage it by design. This can include amending building codes to require infrastructure that makes transforming garages into inhabitable buildings possible. As automated vehicles begin to enter the marketplace, cities should consider incentives and other programs to begin the conversion of ground level parking to commercial uses. Cities and state governments can encourage the long-term transition of parking to help minimize future grayfield blight by offering grants, financing, and other incentives to encourage transitioning parking to new uses as automated vehicles become more mainstream. Together, transportation, real estate professionals, and policymakers need to identify potential alternative uses that could occupy existing parking, if repurposed or renovated. They should also consider collaborating to develop a legal framework that is conducive to adapting and converting existing parking for other uses.

Hundreds of people from the automobile and technology industries are gathering at the Automated Vehicles Symposium in San Francisco this week to exchange notes and speculate about the ways autonomous vehicles might change our lives. If this year’s symposium is like others, few of the attendees will be from city agencies like transportation and planning departments.
That’s a shame.
As I contemplate the exciting (or frightening, depending on your perspective) future of transportation, I wish desperately to engage on the topic with the people who actually shape how we build and get around in cities.
Without input from city staff, we risk a replay of the mistakes made in changing our cities for the automobile age. In adapting to an autonomous future, we must not sideline people, the public realm, and the built environment in favor of the needs of one transportation mode as we did a century ago.
City staff bring a different lens to this issue than most of the engineers and designers at the center of the autonomous vehicle revolution. They bring a perspective grounded in their missions as public servants and in the technical issues they deal with on a day-to-day basis:
Street safety: Departments of transportation are principally responsible for designing streets that protect the most vulnerable users — pedestrians and cyclists — while ensuring that they function adequately for all other modes. What they know about the evolving practice of doing this effectively, as encapsulated in the NACTO Urban Street Design Guide and other progressive guidelines, can add a great deal to the discussion of what the algorithms determining AV behavior should consider. City staff should also consider how AVs might help conserve street space in city and neighborhood centers, where creating ample space for human connections is most important.
Livability and vibrancy: Planning departments are responsible for helping cities prepare for future growth and for creating an interesting, comfortable public realm through zoning and long-range planning.

Critically, the parking requirements they incorporate in zoning codes are one of most important determinants of which buildings get built, how they get built, and the transportation choices of those who inhabit them.
In zoning for cars over the last century, planning departments have led their cities to vastly overbuilt parking, with the most damaging effects on town centers and commercial strips that feed off proximity and human activity.
 How we evolve zoning codes and parking requirements for the autonomous age can either help correct for a century of excesses or perpetuate our already car-clogged society.
Equity: City staff will want to know if travel by autonomous vehicle will be cheap enough to benefit the most economically vulnerable members of our society.
The extent to which cities provide ladders of opportunity to low-income residents is an important marker of their quality as places, and transportation is an important factor in determining how easy it is to get to the jobs, educational institutions, and social service agencies that provide those ladders.
If AVs are adopted in the same way cars were — as private, rather than shared, mobility resources — those without the means to purchase what will likely be an expensive technology will be effectively relegated to a more limited set of travel options, similar to what happens in many cities today.
If AVs are adopted as part of shared fleets, with transit systems at the center, they might be more accessible to all.
The Role of City Staff
So who will determine how AVs are adopted? Right now, federal and state governments have been focused on the technology and how it might be operated. Ultimately, state and federal policy makers have great power to determine the trajectory of the technology (if they are willing to use that power), but cities alone will help determine how local streets and the built environment will evolve to make way for AV travel.
There are four areas that will make a big difference, and they are all within the control of city staff: Curb space, parking, pricing, and pilots.
Curb space: Adjust approaches to street design and managing curb space
If autonomous vehicles are adopted as shared mobility resources, rather than private ones, they could vastly increase the movement of people in individual travel lanes, which could in turn greatly diminish a major impediment to handing right-of-way space to transit vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians in suburban cities today: opposition from an auto-oriented public. The management of curbside space will need special consideration. The bike-and-pedestrian-safety challenges posed by ride-hailing pick-up and drop-off activity offer a warning of what could happen in a shared autonomous future in which people’s main interface with the built environment is at the curb, rather than in parking lots.
City staff should:


Shift right-of-way space toward wider sidewalks, transit lanes, and bicycle facilities to both anticipate and encourage higher-occupancy vehicle travel in congested areas.


Begin allocating more curb space to passenger loading, and in areas with bike lanes or transit service, adjust the design of loading zones to reduce conflicts with other modes.


Parking: Adjust parking regulations and management of vehicle storage
Shared autonomous vehicles offer the potential to substantially reduce the need for parking.
Some early analyses estimate that parking demand could drop by as much as 80 or 90 percent if the entire small-vehicle fleet is shared.
Even if some of the fleet is privately owned, self-driving and self-parking cars could more efficiently use parking spaces.
The ways cities regulate the parking supply will need to shift to account for AVs. Recent research has shown that providing ample parking actively incentivizes driving, and in turn leads to more parking demand, while providing less parking shifts the incentive structure toward other modes, leading to less parking demand.
City staff should:


Eliminate parking minimums and replace them with parking maximums, to avoid over-providing parking in an era in which parking demand could drop dramatically.


Begin considering long-term plans for public off-street parking supplies that evolve the use of these buildings or land and ensure these city assets are still economically productive in an era of reduced parking demand.


To bridge the gap between today’s auto-oriented travel behavior and a multimodal future, implement a transportation demand management (TDM) ordinance along the lines of the one San Francisco recently put in place to provide incentives to shift toward space-efficient travel modes today.


Pricing: Provide financial incentives to encourage shared travel behavior
Parking pricing is one strategy many cities use to influence traveler behavior in their most congested areas. Tolls and congestion pricing are other ways of creating incentives for the use of shared modes.
Using a combination of roadway and curbside pricing could also help to encourage the use of shared AVs in places where demand for curb space might be most intense, such as transit hubs.

Figuring out how to charge more for inefficient uses of this limited curb space — i.e. private cars picking up or dropping off a single passenger — may be quite important in these types of environments.
City staff should:


Consider tolling in key corridors and congestion pricing in high-traffic areas.


Price parking in the areas where demand is highest and/or where it makes more sense based on city goals to use limited space for active uses rather than parking.


Pilots: Support the development of high-occupancy AV technology through pilots
Transit agencies can help spur the development of autonomous buses and shuttles by partnering with autonomous shuttle companies on pilots of the technology (examples of this are already happening). Such pilots might be most prudent in less complex operating environments (i.e. outside dense downtowns) and on routes or portions of routes that are hard to serve using traditional buses (i.e. where low ridership makes it inefficient to use full-size buses or provide frequencies that make transit attractive). They can help the companies developing the technology to ensure that the vehicles operate safely for both those onboard and those outside and to provision their vehicles with appropriate passenger accommodations. Ultimately, in the densest parts of cities, high occupancy vehicles will continue to hold a distinct advantage over small vehicles because of geometry — the sheer number of people who want to be in space-constrained downtowns everyday make it necessary to get them there on modes that are as space-efficient as possible.
Cities should:


Partner with companies developing high-occupancy autonomous vehicles to pilot the technology in the places where doing so is prudent.


At the conference this week and at others to come, a few colleagues and I will be starting the conversation: How do we want our cities to evolve, and how can the future of transportation support this vision? Cities have a great deal of power to determine whether we maximize the best aspects of the coming autonomous vehicle revolution or instead let shiny new mobility technologies run roughshod over the aspects of urban life we treasure most. My hope is that city staff and visionaries come together to create a future we can all enjoy.

Didi Chuxing last year beat the car-sharing business model’s pioneer Uber Technologies at its own game, and bought out the New York company’s China business to become the dominant app for hailing taxis or sharing a ride in the world’s most populous country.
Less than a year on, Didi’s dominance is being challenged by an unlikely source — about 40 smartphone apps that have sprouted in major Chinese cities since late 2016 for commuters to share bicycles.
Yes, bicycles. The two-wheel conveyance has become the most popular means of last-mile transportation from subway stations and bus terminals to final destinations. Users can pick them up anywhere, leave them anywhere, often for as little as 1 yuan per hour, sometimes for free, and occasionally — depending on promotions — receive cash prizes.
The change in transportation means monthly savings of 500 yuan (US$73), about 5 per cent of the salary of Freddie Tian, who works at an office in Futian district in Shenzhen.
He’s taken to using the city’s subway again, as the easy availability of shared bicycles lets him cover the 10 minutes from his apartment to the subway with ease. Formerly a frequent Didi user, Tian said he no longer takes the taxi.





“I can get up a little later in the morning as I don’t need to worry about traffic jams anymore,” he said.
Tian is hardly alone in ditching taxis or shared car rides for the bicycle. Bicycles as a mode of transportation has doubled to 11.6 per cent of total transportation within a year, from 5.5 per cent, while the ratio by cars has fallen to 29.8 per cent from 26.6 per cent in the same period, according to an April report by Beijing Mobike Technology Co. and Tsinghua University.
The growth trend is explosive. The number of shared bicycle users will more than double to 50 million by the end of 2017, from 18 million at the end of 2016, according to Big Data Research, a Chinese consultancy.
To meet the demand, Beijing Bikelock Technology Co. has deployed 5 million of its yellow Ofo bicycles around China, and has even begun to expand its services to the US, Britain and Singapore.
Mobike, backed by the operator of China’s largest social network, said it received 20 million orders on its bike-sharing platform everyday on average in the month of April, a record for the industry.
It has put nearly 4 million orange bicycles on the roads across the country, allocating as many as 200,000 each in major cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.
Didi didn’t provide specific data of the orders it’s received in the past few months since the emergence of bike-sharing apps. It’s hedged its bets, by being an early investor in Ofo.

“Didi is a strategic investor in Ofo and has recently added the bike-sharing service to its main app because we see the potential of the business in catering to distinct short-trip needs of a segment of the population,” the company said in an email response to the Post, adding that bike-sharing complements its one-stop mobility platform and the less-than-mature public transportation network with flexible and affordable last-mile alternatives.
Founded in 2012, Didi has 400 million customers across 400 Chinese cities. The startup company has more than 100 investors, among them Apple Inc, Tencent and Alibaba Group Holdings, which owns the South China Morning Post.
Ant Financial, the online payments platform headed by Alibaba’s founder Jack Ma Yun, is also an investor in Bikelock’s Ofo.
The three-year-old bicycle rental company has raised a total of US$650 million in funding, valuing it at more than US$2 billion.
Mobike’s investors include Singapore’s Temasek Holdings and Hillhouse Capital.

Traffic jams, shortage of parking space and vehicular pollution are rising across the country. Yet that does not stop people from buying more vehicles.
India is seen as a promising market by domestic and multinational car-makers as passenger car density here is about 20 per 1000 people compared to about 100 in China and 380 in the US. Rising incomes and urbanisation will push up car ownership.
Therefore, the Government needs to put into quick action, solutions that will discourage car ownership.
This cannot be limited to bus and rail-based mass transit systems, taxis, autos and taxi ride shares.
People require personal mobility solutions that allow them freedom of movement. Self-drive car-sharing may offer this for intra-city movement.
India has a few ventures that offer self-drive cars. But self-drive car sharing needs to be Uberised. Such cars should be easy to hire using a mobile app, just like an Ola or an Uber cab. It has to become more affordable than it is now.
And it needs to be supported with reserved slots in all public parking spaces, railway stations, metro stations and airports.
Car-sharing can be a liberating experience for users, as they don’t need to bother with the maintenance and servicing. All of that will be taken care of by the fleet-owner.

Uberising car-share in cities like Delhi may be difficult but it can be tried in smaller cities and big towns where ownership of personal vehicles is still low.
India has plans for a 100 per cent shift to electric vehicles by 2030, but the adoption may be slow as e-vehicles are more expensive than conventional ones.
Promoting car-sharing ventures, with incentives for those plugging the car to a charging point, may just be a way to popularise these vehicles while discouraging private ownership.

The ride share economy is set for another shake-up with the launch of Taxify in Australia this morning.

Founded in Estonia and now operating across Europe, Taxify has entered the Australian market in Sydney only at this stage and claims to have 4000 drivers already registered.
Taxify will take 15 per cent commission from its drivers, which it claims is only around half that of Uber and is offering a 50 per cent discount to all rider for one months as part of its launch
Markus Villig, founder and CEO of the new platform said he had been looking forward to launching in Sydney.
“We are confident that locals are looking for an alternative ride sharing option, and Taxify is committed to providing both riders and drivers with what they want,” Mr Villig said. “We have based our business model on fairness and transparency and it is because of this that we have had so many drivers sign up to Taxify in such a short space of time.”
Taxify’s Australian country manager Samuel Raciti said he expected the launch to be well received by drivers and passengers, who would both benefit financially.

“We value and reward loyalty and are excited to offer e new experience to Sydneysiders,” he said. “Our focus as a company has always been providing our drivers with higher revenue-per-ride, as we’re firm in our belief that happy riders mean happy drivers.”
Taxify, like Uber, will have surge prices and multipliers for busier periods, but these would be capped to 1.5 times the regular price, a spokesperson confirmed. The cap will not apply on New Year’s Eve however, in order to ensure there are enough drivers on the road to meet demand.
Moneysaver HQ contacted Uber for a response to the launch, but an Uber spokesman said the platform does not comment on competitors.

Ohio’s capital city unveiled the first version of a pioneering transportation operating system on Thursday that will bring online its smart city transportation network.
Columbus beat out six other cities in 2016 to win the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Smart City Challenge. It received a $40 million federal grant, plus $10 million from billionaire investor Paul Allen’s Vulcan Inc., to implement data-driven ideas that make transportation safer, easier and more reliable.
Democratic Mayor Andrew Ginther said, “Today’s initial launch of the Smart Columbus Operating System is a major milestone in our smart city journey, as we are now better able to analyze, interpret and share data that will help us solve critical challenges and inspire innovation.”
The city’s Smart Columbus team said the operating platform is the first of its kind nationally. It will gather, aggregate and share data on how and why people are moving in and around Columbus, with the goal of making life run more smoothly.

The information that’s collected will allow both the public and private sectors to integrate transportation technologies, such as self-driving cars, connected vehicles and smart sensors into the city’s transportation network. More robust mobility data could help get excess groceries to food banks faster or warn drivers of oversized trucks of low bridges to avoid collisions.

Ginther said the end goal is to improve lives.
“Fundamental to ‘becoming smart’ as a city is discovering how to use data to improve city services and quality life for residents,” he said. “When we apply data to the challenges we experience as a city, we can transform outcomes in education, employment, healthcare and even access to healthy food.”
Developers said the operating system will serve as the “technical backbone” for eight technology demonstration projects supported by the Transportation Department grant. Columbus won its spot as the testing ground over San Francisco; Pittsburgh; Denver; Portland, Oregon; Austin, Texas; and Kansas City, Missouri.
In its initial state, the operating system will publish 1,100 data feeds, curated by the Smart Columbus staff, around six wide-ranging mobility-related challenges.
The announcements came amid efforts by Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich to advance smart transportation technology statewide.
Kasich signed an executive order last week authorizing autonomous vehicle research to take place on all public roads across the state. The order laid out safety parameters for such projects and creates a voluntary pilot program linking local governments to participating companies.
The order extended Kasich’s efforts to make Ohio a hub of smart vehicle research and development.

The coming wave of ride-hailing companies and driverless cars will push down levels of  vehicle ownership, reduce parking demand, and transform the way that city planners, real  estate owners, and consumers interact with urban space, a panel of experts said at the ULI Fall Meeting.
Consumer adoption of ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft has already started affecting how some private urban developments and municipal projects are built, but the large-scale implementation of autonomous vehicles over the next decade will have even more wide-ranging implications—both positive and negative—real estate and transportation officials said during a panel discussion in Los Angeles.
“We believe that the coming transportation revolution is inevitable, powerful, and those that are on top of it can gain an edge in planning and underwriting,” said Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors, an independent research and advisory firm concentrating on the commercial real estate industry in North America.
Bragg moderated the panel discussion and outlined a recent report produced by Green Street Advisors in conjunction with ULI that posits the coming impact of transportation changes on the real estate industry. The report suggests that vehicle ownership and parking demand will plunge and suggests that urban and suburban dynamics could be altered by easier commutes. Industries such as self-storage, billboards, and low-quality retail could be negatively affected, the reports states, while high-quality retail could be winners by converting existing parking into new commercial or residential space.

Cities will have to adjust to the new transportation paradigm as well. The report highlights a case in Summit, New Jersey, as an early indicator of the type of policy change that could become widespread. Rather than building a needed parking garage near the train station, the city partnered with Uber to subsidize residents’ rides to and from the station. Over ten years’ time, the Uber program will cost the city $2 million—far less than the $15 million price tag for the parking structure. “This is a real tangible example of some of the implications that we should expect to see across the country going forward,” Bragg said.
Joe Brancato, regional managing principal at Gensler, an architecture, design, planning, and consulting firm, said that architects are already taking into account the expected change in parking demand. He said it is increasingly common for designers to create parking structures that can be more easily converted into other uses down the road once they become obsolete.
How those parking spaces are repurposed will depend on the type of structure. Brancato said that a stand-alone garage with proper slab-to-slab heights could be converted into office space or even residential space, while lower-grade or older parking structures could be reconfigured as last-mile distribution centers for e-commerce companies.
Brancato said that creating buildings, roads, and cities more focused on humans than cars is a “tremendous opportunity” that has only just begun and will accelerate as autonomous vehicles gain adoption in the coming years. “This entire movement is really about creating a better experience for people,” he said.

Municipal transportation planners, however, are taking a cautious approach to the self-driving revolution. Los Angeles Department of Transportation general manager Seleta Reynolds said that merely dropping massive amounts of autonomous vehicles into a complicated city traffic system without proper planning would likely reignite urban sprawl and exacerbate congestion.
Reynolds argued that ride sharing and automation must work in conjunction with mass transit instead of working to replace it. She also said that automation, shared rides, and electrification must all progress together for wholesale transportation changes to work efficiently for cities. “If any one of those or any two of those things rise without the others, we’re in for quite a bit of negative consequences,” she said.
Debs Schrimmer, transportation policy manager for Lyft, said the company is working with cities to determine how ride sharing can fill gaps in the transportation network without discouraging mass transit use.
Lyft, which is simultaneously working with auto manufacturers and conducting its own self-driving research, has set a goal of 1 billion electric autonomous trips a year by 2025. “Hopefully, many of them are to transit stations,” she said.
Schrimmer said that in order to fully realize the benefits of autonomous vehicles, passengers will have to subscribe to a network and hail rides as needed, rather than own their own personal autonomous vehicle. “An electric self-driving traffic jam is still a traffic jam,” she said.

Investors including Japan’s SoftBank and Google-parent Alphabet are fueling a drive to a ride-sharing future, betting on startups such as industry giants Uber and Lyft which have so far failed to deliver profits.

The frenzied pace of investment suggests optimism over a new model that has disrupted local taxi and transport operations around the globe.
A recent Goldman Sachs study projected that the worldwide ride-sharing market could grow eight-fold by the year 2030, reaching $285 billion annually.
Lyft, which is Uber’s main rival in the United States, raised a billion dollars in a recent investment round led by an investment arm of Alphabet.
That means the Google parent now has investments in both Uber and Lyft.

Meanwhile Uber’s board of directors has approved a plan that opens the door to a colossal investment by Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank.
Another major player in the sector, Didi Chuxing in China, bought Uber’s operations in that country last year and has invested in Lyft and India’s Ola as well.
Didi has become Asia’s most valuable startup, worth some $50 billion based on a recent funding round.
Uber’s new chief executive has vowed to take the company, valued privately at nearly $70 billion, public with a stock market debut by the year 2019. Lyft, with a valuation near $11 billion, is reported to be mulling a strategy to also go public.
Data over dollars
Despite the staggering private valuations, smartphone-summoned ride services have yet to prove they can turn profits, and have repeatedly run into roadblocks from regulators and traditional taxi operators in several countries.
Aside from clashes with entrenched industry powers, proudly disruptive Uber has earned a sulfurous reputation with a litany of scandals, lawsuits and investigations.
Uber lost about $600 million in the second quarter of this year, after losing $2.8 billion in all of 2016. Ridership nevertheless is soaring.
Such red ink on balance sheets has not deterred investors with the resources of Alphabet or SoftBank, with amounts they have sunk into ride-sharing startups considered “pretty modest,” Jack Gold of J.Gold Associates told AFP.
Gold said that high-powered investors may be less interested in quick returns from the day-to-day business of on-demand rides, and keener on getting their hands on data gathered by the operations.
“There is a major amount of data to be had for analysis from all of the Lyft and Uber drivers,” Gold said.
“So investments in these companies are about finding ways to leverage the installed base of drivers, and less about any financial reward from existing operations.”
Ride-sharing services get to know about travel habits, schedules, and profiles of passengers and drivers, typically analyzing information with software to anticipate demand and improve service.
Rides, not cars
Such data can also be a treasure trove to mine in the development of self-driving cars, which have been touted as the future of urban transport.
Ride-sharing services are seen as promising early users of the technology, letting people shun vehicle ownership in favor of simply summoning rides whenever they wish with the machines doing all the work.

With cars navigating themselves, passengers will likely spend more time immersed in on-board entertainment or services, likely streamed via wireless internet connections.
Google and other online titans would profit from going along for the ride.
“Once we get to self-driving cars the need to own one for most will evaporate, which means firms like Lyft and Uber will effectively own the car market,” said independent tech analyst Rob Enderle.
“Google and SoftBank want a part of that action.”
Human drivers are considered a prime expense for ride-sharing firms, which Goldman Sachs research found to be a “significant contributor” to the lack of operating profit.
Fully autonomous vehicles could eliminate about 6.2 million drivers in the workforce, according to Goldman Sachs.
The self-driving car is expected to be “the trigger to transform” ride-sharing operations, according to Goldman Sachs.
A Lyft unit devoted to the technology collaborates with US car maker Ford, as well as with Alphabet’s self-driving car subsidiary Waymo.
Uber has also been investing in autonomous cars, its collaborations including one with General Motors, which is among Lyft investors.
IHS Markit analyst Jeremy Carlson said the dream of “autonomous mobility on demand” is starting to come into view, which can be a game-changer for ride-sharing.
“I think that fed a lot of investment into it,” he said.

The impact of ride-hailing has been swift and sweeping. Uber, which was founded less than a decade ago in 2009, has become a multibillion dollar transportation startup with worldwide ambitions, and the technical ability to pursue autonomous vehicle technology and even experiment with Blade Runner-esque flying cars.
But as Uber and Lyft continue to expand, it’s important to remember that for all the high-tech advances, an equally important part of their legacies has been institutionalizing the gig economy. With more than two million employees in the United States combined, these two companies helped make these new working arrangements an everyday part of many people’s lives.
And their continued reckoning with labor issues, costs, and recruitment suggest they haven’t figured out the right formula.
Harry Campbell understands the evolution of Uber and Lyft better than most. Known as the Rideshare Guy, after his popular blog and podcast about working in the industry, Campbell created an important forum and resource for the industry, inspired by his time as a driver.
His new book, The Rideshare Guide, offers advice on getting started and getting established as a driver, but also offers insight into how ridehailing has evolved, and the issues that drivers face.
“People take Uber or Lyft as a passenger, and they often don’t understand how many people these companies are employing,” Campbell told Curbed. “Lyft has more than 700,000 drivers, and Uber has 2 to 3 million worldwide, with 1.5 million in the U.S. It’s becoming a more traditional option for work, whereas in the past, it was something sort of cool and different.”
Curbed spoke to Campbell about making it in the gig economy, the frustrations of drivers, and the future of Uber, Lyft, and their competitors.

Is Uber actually making moves to treat its drivers better, with the recent change in leadership, and are they making a difference?


“It’s clear they’re starting to care more about drivers. Last year, they launched the 180 Days of Change campaign and added tipping and a 24-hour support line. [These changes are] not huge, but they represent a move in the direction of improving things for drivers. But the complaints you heard from drivers were that these weren’t exactly revelations.

The 24-7 support line is something people have been asking about for the last three to four years. It was really odd there was no way to call Uber.”



“Uber is still facing an uphill battle because they’ve done so little for so long. They deserve some credit, but probably not as much as if they had been supporting the drivers all along. The new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi seems like he cares more about drivers.
But drivers care more about raising their rates, and the ever-growing commission Uber takes. It looks like the company is addressing everything else but those issues.”
Turnover is still incredible massive for these companies. Is that strictly a matter of pay?
“Pay is a big factor. A lot of drivers come in with the expectation that they’re going to make good money. Look at the marketing campaigns they’re running, when they talk about “the ultimate side hustle.”
When you measure messaging and expectations— remember that the average driver is making between $16 and $18 a hour before taxes, close to minimum wage—it hurts retention. Factor in services like UberPOOL [Uber’s shared ride service] and the ever-growing commission Uber and Lyft are taking, and that doesn’t help.”
Uber gets billions from venture capital investors and can’t pay their drivers a full-time wage, is bleeding money, and still telling people to come and work for them. How do drivers view these contradictions?
“Retention is poor, and a lot of drivers are quitting, but there are also lots of drivers who are able to figure it out in the bigger cities. In cities such as LA and San Francisco, for example, they’re able to make $7 more an hour than the average. Drivers with experience are making more than newbie drivers.
There’s a ton of variability, and subsidies and bonuses have become such a huge part of income for drivers now.”

So for Uber and Lyft, retention and expanding the workforce is clearly a big challenge. What can they do to make a difference?
“It’s really not the sexiest thing, but they just need to pay drivers more. Uber and Lyft are trying to do everything they can do around the edges right now. They’re investing in customer support and try to improve pickups and drop offs for UberPOOL.
But pay and flexibility are the main things that drivers care about, and everything else isn’t that important. Uber made a big announcement in April, and had the CEO speak. Drivers were expecting a lot. And it was all for a new driver’s app.
The feedback we got from drivers was that the app was cool, but that’s not even on the list of the top five issues I actually care about.”
Does the recent California case about independent contracting impact Uber and Lyft, and will this case and others cases like it make a big difference?
“There’s a lot of hype around that case, and it is a big ruling. If you look at the test they talk about in the case to determine the difference between an employee and independent contractor, Uber and Lyft drivers are clearly employees.
But their whole model is predicated on independent business contractors. Uber and Lyft will do anything to protect that, so if that means giving drivers a little more freedom so they meet the independent contractor test, they’ll do it.”

Drivers ask, ‘Why are you spending money on flying cars? Pay me now, I need to pay bills now.’”

Do you see the work you’re doing as a first step in setting the boundaries for gig economy jobs in the future, and future labor issues?
“The book is ultimately a how-to guide for driving for Uber and Lyft, but there’s a lot of advice that’ll be applicable to anybody working in the gig economy.
When you start, the companies are all shiny and new. But once you get into it and start peeling back the layers, at the end of the day, you’re running a business. There’s all sorts of tough business choices you have to make in terms of liability and taxes.”
Are these companies sustainable?
“I think the model is sustainable because on the consumer side, there is huge demand for Uber and Lyft. And on the driver side, despite the massive turnover, millions of people are driving for these companies.
If you can earn the same amount working 40 hours a week at Uber or McDonald’s, well, I’d rather work for Uber. With other jobs, you have no flexibility. So I think this mode is here to stay.”
“But for Uber and Lyft, there’s a lot of venture capital money subsidizing the pay side of things. The amount that riders pay and drivers get paid is still in flux. But I think they’re going to have to pay drivers more.
This is Silicon Valley 101: Lower prices to generate demand and subsidize until eventually you find that balance. Uber and Lyft have been really resistant to raising prices. That’s why I call this the Golden Era of Rideshare, it’s cheaper than ever to take an Uber and Lyft, especially with Lyft Line and all of these budget-friendly options for the average rider.
I was surprised when reading the book at just how much drivers hate services like UberPOOL. Is there anything they can do to turn that around?
“When Uber first launched UberPOOL, they charged less even though it was more challenging for drivers to make all the pickups and dropoffs, and they would get paid less. You can imagine it wasn’t well-received. Now, drivers use these rides to make their bonuses quicker. Going forward, drivers will need to be rewarded better for their effort.”
“One of the things I enjoy highlighting is that Uber’s narrative to the public and media varies with the story they’re telling their actual drivers. ‘UberPOOL is the future for us, it allows us to improve congestion and do more rides and improve utilization.’ But 65 percent of drivers are dissatisfied with their UberPOOL experience, and almost everybody hates it. UberPOOL may have benefits for the company, but it’s still a work in progress.
So is there a huge disconnect between the pay issues of everyday drivers, and news that Uber is sinking money into a flying car summit?
“Drivers aren’t dumb. There’s a disconnect between what it’s like being a driver, day in and day out, and the employees working at Uber and Lyft. It’s hard for them to put themselves in the drivers’ shoes. But the drivers are thinking short-term.
You look at the retention numbers, and they probably won’t be around when self-driving cars are here. They ask, ‘Why are you spending money on flying cars? Pay me now, I need to pay bills now.’”

PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — With a stated goal of making the outdoors more accessible to everyone, the Oregon State Parks Foundation is teaming up with 2 car-sharing services to have state park day-use parking passes in all their cars.

ReachNow and Zipcar will have the free parking passes and state park guides in all of their car-sharing services throughout the Portland metro. This is the second year Zipcar has taken part in this program, but greatly expanded from its 2017 effort.
Cars from both services can be reserved by the hour or the day.
From tidepools at the coast to disc golf at Champoeg State Park, there are many adventures within a 2-hour drive of Portland.
In 2017, there were more than 50 million day-use visits to the Oregon State Parks. But the foundation said transportation can be a barrier to this kind of outdoor recreation.


A ReachNow car on the streets in downtown Portland, May 21, 2018 (KOIN)

ReachNow said all the BMW 3-series and BMW X1 SAV vehicles in their Oregon and Seattle fleets will have the state park passes by Memorial Day weekend.
“When you’re ready to go, you can open up the app, you search for a BMW,” said Tim Navarrette of ReachNow. “All our BMW X1’s and 3-series have the state park passes in them.”
Navarrette said it’s an easy way for people to get to the state parks and help out, as well.
“For every trip that’s taken to an Oregon State Park, we’re donating money to the Oregon State Parks Foundation,” he said. “We’re doing it in the Seattle area and Portland, as well.”
The company will donate up to $25,000 to the Oregon or Washington State Parks Foundations this summer.
Some Zipcars have a bike rack, making it easy to take your bike with you on an adventure.
“I think it’s a great option for people who live downtown, don’t have cars and do a lot of public transportation,” said Heather Anderson, who works in Portland.

A full electric city bus today costs around Rs. 1.5 crore. The first electric city bus by Ashok Leyland, expected to be launched by late next year, would be significantly cheaper, perhaps by over Rs 30 lakh. That would be not because of any heavy discount but thanks to a new alliance which takes out the battery (the most expensive and very heavy component of an EV) and its charging from the cost equation.
Ashok Leyland has made a head-start in electric and hybrid buses, in both CNG and diesel, including those that do not require a plug-in. Sun Mobility aims to be a leading provider of universal energy infrastructure and services to accelerate mass EV usage.
Sun Mobility plans to revolutionise the transportation sector by deploying a unique open-architecture ecosystem built around its proprietory smart batteries and a network of quick interchange battery stations.
These stations, mainly powered by renewable energy, will refuel EVs at a cost lower than and faster than conventional petrol-diesel fuel stations. “Our focus is commercial viability (of EVs) today,” Chetan Maini, vice-chairman, Sun Mobility, told Autocar Professional. Of the various methods of ‘refuelling’ an EV – overnight charging, one-hour fast charging, ultra-fast charging in less than an hour and swapping, the swapping style helps remove the battery from the equation, lowers the cost and removes range anxiety the fastest. Maini is betting on this advantage for electric mobility in India to gain from, and of course, for Sun Mobility to succeed.
Commenting on the alliance, Vinod K Dasari, CEO and MD, Ashok Leyland, says, “Ashok Leyland has always leveraged Indian engineering and innovation to develop world-class solutions. We were the first and only manufacturer to develop BS III emission compliance using a mechanical fuel pump.
We were also the first in India to develop an SCR-based BS IV solution in 2010. In 2017, we were the world’s first and only company to develop an EGR-based BS IV solution, called iEGR. Our partnership with Sun Mobility is yet another step towards bringing world-class solutions to India, developed in India, and by Indians. We hope to bring several new innovative products to the market at the earliest.”
It was in 2010 that India first got the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan. With that as the base, the FAME India Scheme was launched in April 2015 to promote electric and hybrid vehicles in India. The roadmap for future mobility solutions, released in May by Central government think-tank NITI Ayog, has also focused heavily on electric mobility. Industry leaders say that unlike earlier occasions, the government is more focused and determined to make mass electric mobility a reality. For that to happen, all stakeholders will have to invest significantly. “This would need a level of partnership that the industry hasn’t seen before,” says Maini.
NEW SMART SOLUTION
Sun Mobility, a 50:50 joint venture between Virya Mobility 5.0 and Sun New Energy Systems, pioneers in areas of electric mobility and clean energy, says it will partner with multiple OEMs to integrate its proprietary smart battery solution into a range of innovative EVs – cars, buses, rickshaws and scooters.

The smart batteries will be modular, easily swappable, highly secure, IoT-enabled and can be easily refuelled on a pay-as-you go basis. This energy infrastructure integrated with EVs, smart batteries and clean energy will accelerate the transformation of mobility towards a sustainable, pollution-free future.
Commercial vehicles – city buses, cars owned by cab aggregators and three-wheelers – will be largely targeted to promote electric mobility in the country. Two-wheelers, the biggest segment in the EV industry currently, is also poised to see growth in the coming years.
In an EV, the battery is the most expensive, and also the heaviest component. In the case of buses, Sun Mobility will fit swappable batteries, which are only 20-25 percent of the size of a conventional EV bus battery. “It’s a very flexible open solution where there’s no difference in the price of a bus, whether you are doing 150 or 250 kilometres a day,” says Maini. With smaller batteries, both the operating cost and the overall weight of the vehicle are reduced.
In terms of cost, an electric bus, with the battery and charging system out of the equation, is costlier than a conventional bus with a regular diesel powertrain, but Maini says it will be more cost effective than a conventional bus with a more powerful powertrain and automatic transmission.
A “few patents on the overall ecosystem” of Sun Mobility’s business model, which also includes the battery swapping and management and some core battery technology. Since India doesn’t have any cell manufacturer, the company imports the cells and builds the rest indigenously. In the future, as business grows, Sun Mobility “may probably be directly or strategically involved” in the business of cell manufacturing.
Sun Mobility is in “advanced discussions” with some OEMs and mobility services providers for alliances like the one it has struck with Ashok Leyland. Maini wants to provide different solutions for different players. “Across the chain there will be different types of partnership with companies,” he says.

A strong focus by the government on making mass electric mobility a reality, also presents a good opportunity for standardisation of some systems and processes to reduce overall costs. This is where Sun Mobility could benefit from.
And there possibly will be more players in this space. Sun Mobility will tap a Maini Group firm to develop charging technology to charge all the batteries that vehicles leave behind at the swapping centres. These stations, predominantly powered by renewable energy, will refuel EVs at a cost lower than and at speeds faster than conventional petrol/diesel stations.
A business proposition like Sun Mobility’s could aid in faster adoption of electric vehicles in India. However, there would be a challenge that its engineers will have to address, and that is to ensure the energy density of its batteries remain the same even after different charging cycles.
Shared mobility is attracting a strong focus of Maini and his team as the vehicles clock more kilometres and makes the business case stronger for the company. “Over time, if you think about the shared economy, the value chain is going to be – an OEM, an energy provider, a mobility solution provider.
Unless you get a cost-effective solution, none will have business,” says Maini, who started India’s first electric car company in 2001. He wants Sun Mobility to “play” the middle role with a vision of “Let’s make EVs viable”.

A Wellington-based company called Mevo has launched a new variant of its car-sharing programme that it claims is an Australasian first: it’s “free-floating”, meaning that renters do not have to return a vehicle to the same station they collected it from.
Mevo was launched in 2016 with a car-sharing programme that allows users to book short-term rentals from a fleet of Audi A3 e-tron plug-in hybrid vehicles, using an app on their mobile phone.
The company describes it as a “digital first” experience: renters don’t have to collect a key or access card prior to driving the vehicles away. It’s all done via the mobile network.




Mevo partners include power company Meridian, Z Energy, Trade Me (insurance), Audi and Wellington City Council.
​There are already 10 designated Mevo parking/charging areas around Wellington. But under the free-floating programme, the vehicles can now be dropped at any approved Council parking space in Mevo’s “home zone”.


 The home zone is a relatively restricted area in the Wellington CBD that’s shown on the Mevo app, but does include the airport.


“The ease of use that free-floating provides is a game changer if you’re looking at serious alternatives to private car ownership, giving Wellington residents freedom and mobility through an app on their smartphones, without the hassle of owning and paying for a car,” says Mevo co-founder Erik Zydervelt.
Mayor Justin Lester says car-sharing services are a natural progression for Wellington city: “With more and more people living in the CBD, and the trend away from car ownership, car sharing initiatives are increasingly important,” says Lester.
The Council plans to use the Mevo project as a guide to wider application of car-sharing policy in the future.
The Audi A3 e-tron used for the Mevo fleet is a plug-in hybrid vehicle. According to Audi, it’s capable of up to 50km of electric running on a single charge; when the battery is depleted, it reverts to petrol-electric hybrid operation.
Mevo has both casual and membership plans. Users can pay by the hour ($16-$23) or day ($96-$138), with fixed prices for overnight ($32-$46).
​Renters can also choose to drop them at the Mevo charging stations across the city (found in the app) where they will be guaranteed a park.
Mevo was awarded co-funding from round one of the Government’s Low Emission Vehicles Contestable Fund, administered by EECA. A European Transport & Environment study in 2017 showed that each car “shared” has the potential to take 5-15 private cars off the road.

Many of China’s major cities and metropolitan areas suffer considerably from air pollution. While the causes are multivariate, from factory exhaust to car exhaust, moves to improve the air, and reduce the health impact on inhabitants, has seen local, regional and national initiatives put into place. One initiative in Beijing, and elsewhere, is to reduce the number of cars on the road.
The removal of cars from the road has the benefit of reducing pollution, however, it also affects inhabitants by reducing their travel options. To boost the number of available travel options, Chinese national and local authorities have supported the development of car-sharing.
In a new report from Roland Berger, titled ‘Car Sharing in China’, the consulting firm explores current trends within the car-sharing space within China.

The car-sharing market began in China in 2010, with the launch of CCClub. By 2013 a number of competitors had joined the space, offering a total of around 780 vehicles, with the largest five players owning around 50 vehicles apiece.
The industry, which is subsidised by local and national government policies, grew to 14,000 vehicles in 2015, before hitting 26,000 vehicles last year. The service has in particular grown in tier 1 and tier 2 cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Changsha, Wuhan.
The phenomenon of car-sharing is, according to the firm’s analysis of the situation on the ground, set to continue to grow apace. The firm projects that by 2020 there will be around 100,000 cars within the car-sharing pool in the country, which, by 2025 is set to grow to 600,000. The CAGR will, according to the analysis, stand at 45% between 2015 and 2025.

The car-sharing space in China is broadly divided between three categories of players, OEM owned, 3rd party backed by OEM and 3rd party technology companies. These come in two varieties, global players and local players.
The research finds that players are largely local in origin. With the largest group of active players the 3rd party backed by OEM, which has around 16,000 cars. OEM owned players have the smallest share at 2,500, with around 1,500 coming from two global players: Car2go and Car2share.

As it stands there are three major business models operating in the space in China. There is the ‘round trip’ model, that brings passengers from A to A, this is the model used by Car2share, the largest provider of its type; the ‘one way’ model, brings a passenger from A to B, and is a model used by Evcard; while a free-floating service is offered by Car2go.
While a variety of models exist, getting services off the ground, and eventually profitable, remains difficult – particularly for global entrants. The firm notes a range of challenges that, in different respects, affects the different models.
While the industry is heavily subsidised, accessing the industry, and those subsidies, requires knowledge of a range of local laws and procedures. A second challenge is selecting the right model for the specific region, city, without the right use case and customer proposition, setting up can be difficult – according to the firm. The high-setup costs is an additional challenge, given the general expense of vehicles, as well as insurance and regulatory costs. The low-cost of other services, from public transport to taxis, means that the respective pricing for the service remains relatively low. Additionally, companies face a range of challenges from loss of keys, traffic violations and other customer behaviour, which costs time and money to fix.
As it stands the average utilisation rate for vehicles is around 12%, with the break-even point, according to the firm’s financial calculations coming in at 20%.

To create a robust car-sharing service that continues to operate sustainably, partnerships within the wider ecosystem may present considerable benefits. Partnerships may involve access to hotspots where customers are in abundance, such as firms, hotels, universities, airports, trainstations, etc. Discounting fuel, or access to charging stations, could create incentives for both customers, stations and car-share service providers, while government could play a key role in creating wider infrastructure for the services, outside of direct subsidies. OEMs in addition could offer a range of services to reduce the cost of ownership of vehicles, while local partners could support co-marketing operations.
Aside from leveraging synergies through partnerships, companies can also create value through the creation of bespoke offerings for customers; being innovative and thinking beyond cars, create a China fitting pricing strategy; investing in strong operational capabilities; as well as leveraging digital technologies to reduce back- and front-end costs.
According to Ron Zheng from Roland Berger China, “The industry is still in a nascent stage. New entrants therefore have the chance to give themselves a first-mover advantage and capture market share, just as companies did many years ago in the early days of the automotive industry in China. Meticulous planning will, however, be crucial.”

Austin’s ground transportation industry descended even further into madness this year, as companies across the field jockeyed for a position in a rapidly expanding and ever-changing market.
ATX Co-op Taxi and their fleet of bright-green cabs sprouted in the spring, taking another stab at the co-op model that has eluded Austin’s cabbies for decades.
It’s provoked skepticism from industry veterans like Austin Cab Company, who (while losing drivers to the cause) argued that the idea had been pursued multiple times before and hadn’t been financially viable.

The taxi drivers didn’t have much time to bicker in their own silo. Riders welcomed Uber and Lyft back with open arms in June after the Texas Legislature gutted municipal rideshare regulations.
With them came the aggressive pricing models and other incentives designed to win back a market that had been burned a year earlier when the two titans stole out of town after losing a ballot measure to nix city regs.
One upstart transportation network company, the Arizona-based Fare, dropped out of Austin within two weeks. Others that had developed in the rideshare giants’ absence felt an immediate pinch, but have tried to harness community support to keep truckin’ along.
Homegrown RideAustin focused on community partnerships, like a program with Community Care Col­lab­or­a­tive to help uninsured or low-income county residents get to the doctor.

In August, Boston-based Fasten hired former RideAustin employee (and former communications dir­ect­or for the TravCo Democratic Party) Joe Deshotel as its new director of community engagement, and immediately focused on events packaging quirky consumer data.
Not to be outdone, Austin’s carsharing stalwart Car2Go hit upon a quick success when it introduced a fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles. Driver interest was so high the company (which is owned by Mercedes) decided to ditch the Smart car fleet and go full Benz.
Continuing into next year, the city’s Transportation Depart­ment is working with City Council to discard archaic chauffeur regulations that don’t make as much sense in an environment dominated by ridesharing apps and digital meters.
But change doesn’t come easy, so expect a 2018 full of twists and swerves, beginning in February when deregulation talk concerning cabs is due to take center stage at Council.
They’re a particularly ornery bunch, those cabbies, and quite open to airing their grievances – whatever they may be – down at Council chambers. We’ll keep our eyes on the road.

Beijing-based bicycle sharing start-up Ofo is expected to launch its services in India on Monday and will be made available on Paytm, three people familiar with the development said. Social media posts from One97 Communications’ founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma hinted at the launch via a tweet on Twitter.
Ofo did not respond immediately to an e-mail requesting details of the launch. The development was first reported by the Economic Times in October.
According to the report, users will be able to book and pick up Ofo bikes for $1 per hour using an app. The service is aimed at metro cities and the company has already held talks with government regulatory bodies, the report added.
Ofo signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) last week. Under the MoU, the company plans to create city wide bicycle networks, which is likely to be expanded into other metro cities in India.
The company is also expected to launch the service in Chennai, Indore, Ahmedabad and Bengaluru and it will also invest money for importing bicycles to India, according a report in November 2017 from Chinese news agency Xinhua.
“We are delighted to partner with the city of Pune. We wish to improve its quality of life in the city by providing a healthier, quicker, and greener alternative to motor vehicles.

Our mission is to solve the ‘last mile’ transportation problem in India’s urban areas and we see immense potential in Pune for Ofo’s convenient, affordable and low carbon way of travel,” Rajarshi Sahai, director of public policy & communications at Ofo said in a statement last week while announcing the tie up with PMC.
Founded in 2014, Ofo has operations in over 250 cities across 20 countries with over 200 million global users. In July 2017, Ofo secured a Series E round of funding worth S$700 million led by Alibaba, Hony Capital and CITIC Private Equity. At that time, the company said that it plans to deploy 20 million new bikes and expand its service to more countries.
Ofo’s launch in India comes after domestic start-ups also expressed interest in the category. But Ofo will be the first international company to launch bike sharing in India.
Online cab aggregator Ola introduced bicycle sharing service called Ola Pedal in December 2017. The launch was exclusive in IIT Kanpur campus, but the company mentioned in a statement that it is working on expanding the scope of the service in the coming weeks.
In October 2017, self-drive car rental start-up Zoomcar also launched a bicycle sharing service named PEDL in the Mumbai metropolitan region, Pune, Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru, operating around 500 bicycles.

Oscar Ellison’s car-sharing business is tackling Auckland’s transport crisis head on.
The former Wanganui Collegiate student has started an online platform he dubs the “Airbnb of car rentals” where car owners can rent out their vehicles to people nearby.
Mr Ellison said the latest figures from the New Zealand Transport Agency showed that there were 800 new vehicles each week registered in Auckland alone.
In a bid to reduce car ownership and ultimately the number of cars on the road, Mr Ellison launched his business YourDrive.
“I had just finished Uni in Auckland and was looking at buying a car because I needed one for a job but it was just looking to be so expensive and I started thinking there must be some kind of alternative,” Mr Ellison said.
With that, he started working on the idea of a shared economy that would connect car renters with private car owners.
After pushing through two years of legal and insurance hurdles, he was able to launch his business officially in 2015 – and now has around 500 cars listed on his site from across the country.
“Some people thought it was crazy, because it was just a novel concept, but I challenged them to try it and they soon saw the practicality.
“What we’ve found is that a lot of people are actually moving away from car ownership as they live in more dense areas because they have better access to public transport and don’t want to foot the cost that comes with owning a car,” Mr Ellison said.

The 30 year-old said people enjoy having the freedom to select a car they’d like to drive and being able to rent directly from the locals, whenever they need a car.
“The is also value in the car owners. Depending on the value, make, model of a vehicle, which determines the recommended rate, an owner can earn up to $10,000 a year.”
He said New Zealand had one of the highest rates of car ownership in the world and 96 per cent of the time cars were parked up somewhere not being used.
And for every car shared, there is a reduction in the number of owned vehicles on the road by about 10-15.
When asked if there was risk involved, Mr Ellison there had been a few cars written off but every car listed was insured.
“So not a huge risk at all really.”
Last year the entrepreneur’s business caught the attention of car rental company, JUCY, which bought a 50 per cent share in Your drive.
Mr Ellison said the company had been growing at a phenomenal rate and it was exciting to see the potential this kind of market had.
To students contemplating starting their own business he said the best thing was just to get out there and start.
“Start small, get something up, get talking to people that might want to use your product and build from there.”

Tauranga’s worsening traffic woes have prompted a carpooling movement among frustrated motorists who have “had enough”.
Former Aucklander Josh Cole is running a Tauranga car pooling Facebook page, aimed at getting more people to share rides in and out of town. The CAR Pooling Tauranga/bop page was created on January 31 and has more than 80 people following it.
Another page set up for Welcome Bay commuters on Thursday has already attracted more than 100 members.
Cole, who is on the road for work regularly, said traffic had become much worse.

“I mean, it’s getting really, really bad. We’re basically a mini-Auckland. We’ve also noticed a lot of the cars are single occupancy – especially in Welcome Bay,” he said.
Last week, Tauranga commuters complained the traffic was the worst they had experienced with some in Welcome Bay taking 45 minutes to travel a typical 10-minute journey.
Cole “grew up in wops” in Auckland’s Waitakere Ranges so is familiar with the need to look after the environment, but also with diabolical traffic woes.

“By giving people the choice whether to carpool or to have another car on the road, we hope to reduce our traffic problems,” he said.
Cole said creating more roads was not the answer.
“It’s not what we need. We need more people sharing cars, a better public transport system and more people on bikes. Tauranga is really easy to bike around if you have better, protected, cycleways.
“People have had enough of traffic, that’s for sure. In Auckland, they were very slow to learn and look at the problems they have now. Their public transport system is shocking. I just watch it get worse and worse and worse and not wanting that for Tauranga. Especially as more Aucklanders move down here, bringing their traffic issues with them.”
People are invited to join the page and post a blurb stating what their commute is, how often and at what times. Cole hoped the page would become an active forum for people sharing rides.



Welcome Bay car pooling page creator Erica Wilson said she thought online carpooling sites would work better based on suburbs rather than across the whole city.
She envisaged that carpooling would appeal to Welcome Bay commuters and parents who drove their children to school. She did not think Bayhopper buses offered enough of an incentive to lure people out of their cars because of the slow progress caused by bus stops.
Wilson could not be reached in time before publication.
Nationally, council and transport agencies work together to run a Smart Travel website, which shows precisely what transport options are available to people in their location. This includes carpooling options, matching destinations with people who have registered their travel schedules.
In Tauranga, several carpooling options can be found but only for some destinations.

The ride share economy is set for another shake-up with the launch of Taxify in Australia this morning.

Founded in Estonia and now operating across Europe, Taxify has entered the Australian market in Sydney only at this stage and claims to have 4000 drivers already registered.
Taxify will take 15 per cent commission from its drivers, which it claims is only around half that of Uber and is offering a 50 per cent discount to all rider for one months as part of its launch.
Markus Villig, founder and CEO of the new platform said he had been looking forward to launching in Sydney.
“We are confident that locals are looking for an alternative ride sharing option, and Taxify is committed to providing both riders and drivers with what they want,” Mr Villig said. “We have based our business model on fairness and transparency and it is because of this that we have had so many drivers sign up to Taxify in such a short space of time.”
Taxify’s Australian country manager Samuel Raciti said he expected the launch to be well received by drivers and passengers, who would both benefit financially.

“We value and reward loyalty and are excited to offer e new experience to Sydneysiders,” he said. “Our focus as a company has always been providing our drivers with higher revenue-per-ride, as we’re firm in our belief that happy riders mean happy drivers.”
Taxify, like Uber, will have surge prices and multipliers for busier periods, but these would be capped to 1.5 times the regular price, a spokesperson confirmed.
The cap will not apply on New Year’s Eve however, in order to ensure there are enough drivers on the road to meet demand.
Moneysaver HQ contacted Uber for a response to the launch, but an Uber spokesman said the platform does not comment on competitors.

NASA will soon begin testing in Dallas how Uber’s on-demand air-taxi concept would affect crowded areas.
Uber is in the midst of designing an air-taxi service, called, UberAIR. Officials hope to conduct flight demonstrations starting in 2020 and begin commercial operations in Dallas and Los Angeles by 2023.
And on Tuesday, NASA announced that it would help the company “ensure a safe and efficient system for future air transportation in populated areas.”
NASA is excited to be partnering with Uber and others in the community to identify the key challenges facing the (urban air mobility) market, and explore necessary research, development and testing requirements to address those challenges,” Jaiwon Shin, associate administrator for NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, said in a statement.
“Urban air mobility could revolutionize the way people and cargo move in our cities and fundamentally change our lifestyle much like smartphones have.”
Under this agreement, Uber will provide NASA with its plans for implementing the cutting-edge ride-share network and NASA will use computer modeling and simulations to determine the impact of this kind of aircraft.
The simulations will take place at NASA’s research facility at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.

NASA personnel will analyze safety issues that could arise from small passenger-carrying aircraft flying through the airport’s airspace during “peak scheduled air traffic,” according to the space agency.
An Uber spokesman said Tuesday that early stages of simulation are already being developed.
NASA could not immediately be reached for comment, but Uber already has been working with the space agency to “develop a specialized air-traffic-control network to keep track of our newly crowded skies” – an agreement that was announced in November, USA Today reported.

The company is hosting an Uber Elevate Summit in Los Angeles this week and unveiled its air-taxi prototype just ahead of Tuesday’s events.
“On-demand aviation has the potential to radically improve urban mobility, giving people back time lost in their daily commutes,” Uber said in a white paper about the project.


The all-electric aircraft, designed for four passengers, would have vertical take-off and landing capabilities similar to those of a helicopter. It would have four sets of stacked propellers and a cruising speeds of about 150 mph.


Tests of the UberAIR are expected to begin in 2020 in Los Angeles, Dallas, and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Business Insider reported Tuesday. Once the service is officially launched, passengers would call UberAIR on their smartphones and meet at designated rooftop landing pads, or “skyports,” which could see 200 takeoffs and landings an hour, the article said.
In November, Jeff Holden, Uber’s chief product officer, said the company expects people in Los Angeles will make “heavy use” of the service by the 2028 summer Olympics there.
And the Uber white paper on the project, available at www.uber.com/info/elevate, said the company expects UberAIR to eventually be “an affordable form of daily transportation for the masses, even less expensive than owning a car.”

Fast cars seem like a ridiculous and ostentatious display of wealth – until you drive them. Then it starts to make a whole lot of sense.
The road to Raglan is equal parts motorway and snaking, single-lane hill climb. Ideally you want a mixture of speed and finesse, something that hugs the road around the bends but takes flight in the right circumstances.
Something like a Nissan 370Z, a 3.5litre sports car from the people that brought you the Skyline. Unfortunately for me, picking up a 370Z is about as practicable as picking up a house, coming in somewhere around $20K second-hand. What you can do, however, is rent one from someone who can afford to own one.

While the owner William studied for his engineering exam in a sweltering Auckland apartment I was almost 200km away, watching set after set of six foot waves peel into Manu Bay. Seven tuis flitted about in the wall of harakeke framing the surf, and a gentle breeze carried spray from the rocks across the grass and into my hair.
Offshore three boats skirted the break, heading west in the shadow of the volcano Karioi, their engines muted enough to be an almost pleasant hum beneath the sound of the birds. It was a tough day’s mahi.
That morning, around nine, I had taken the train three stops from my flat, walked five minutes in the early morning sun, grabbed the keys (well, remote – the thing was a bloody spaceship), and fled the city within a few more minutes. It was simple as a TradeMe transaction and surprisingly liberating.
New Zealanders have a real obsession with their cars and by implication somewhere to park them, and wash them, and take side-on profile shots for the inevitable TradeMe listing – truly the Kiwi dream. But while the ownership of tangible assets might be a hangover from our experiences on the stock market, the vast majority of cars rapidly depreciate to the point of almost worthlessness, and that’s just leaving the yard.
Financially they don’t make a whole lot of sense if you have access to even barebones public transport, particularly considering the AA estimates the costs of owning a car at around $20 every day, provided you shop around for deals on things like tyres.
If you’re anything like me, that $20 buys you the convenience of maybe driving to the supermarket once a week while you fill the AT coffers on the train every day.

There are social costs too, many of which carsharing alleviate. According to the US Transportation Board, every car injected into the sharing economy takes 15 privately-owned vehicles off the road, a huge reduction that could affect real change while we wait for urban authorities to build infrastructure fit for a real city, as well as alleviating at least some of the emissions that spew forth at every step of the car manufacturing and maintenance process.
And that’s not to mention our shameful road toll – more than 370 this year alone, up more than 50 on the year before.
But that is somewhat immaterial when one considers the area where cars are obviously superior to any form of public transport or Uber-esque service is in the getaway; escaping the rat race and fleeing to the beach, or the snow, or wherever it is you make your fun.
As a whole we’re willing to sacrifice a huge amount for that slice of freedom. And it makes sense when we’ve been sold on private ownership as the only option – but that’s no longer true.
While Yourdrive is unlikely to replace any one form of transport entirely, like most of the sharing economy it fits into a system of similar services with the ultimate goal of flexibility. You can walk to the supermarket and take an Uber home on Wednesday.
Then pick up a car from Yourdrive for the weekend. And the beauty is, there’s a vehicle for every trip.



BEAUTIFUL MATAKATIA


The 370Z was ideal for a high speed mission across the treacherous roads to Raglan, but heading up north I wanted something a little more leisurely. Something that just said cool. And that’s the beauty of Yourdrive. As I’ve lamented before, on a regular day I’m stuck with one option, my 1989 Holden Commodore, and that’s provided I can find somewhere to park where my expired rego and warrant won’t get snapped. On Yourdrive however I can window shop with a single finger, like Tinder for car dates.
How would I look behind the wheel of a Mercedes, thought I? Would a Range Rover perhaps fill the void? For $400 I could spend the day in a brand new Tesla, but how about something without a roof? And then I saw her.
The year was 1969, the dying gasp of the swinging sixties – Led Zeppelin released their first album, Richard Nixon ensconced himself in the White House, and at the Ford factory they pumped out the third generation ‘69 Falcon, a convertible two-door straight six with more style than you could shake your 60s hips at.
Andrei’s cherry red falcon is one of the few cars in the country older than my own, and about ten trillion times as cool. Up the Northern Motorway I drove like a poor, poor man’s Hunter Thompson, devoid of both the drugs and the talent, but absolutely stoked to not have a roof. At Matakatia I waved at the elderly, in Puhoi I stopped at the pub.
Matakana was for pies, Tawharanui for a swim and a tan, and all the while I shuffled through a playlist of old-school rock, modern funk and some real, straight up gangsta shit for the fellas. I promise you this, Jefferson Airplane might be more topical, or Lord Echo more groovy, but there’s nothing quite like listening to Dr Dre’s 2001 album, start to finish, the way it was meant to be: in a convertible.
I offer a warning too: just because the breeze cools you down, it doesn’t mean you won’t get absolute singed without some sunblock. But despite the burn I finished grinning, and once the car was back with her dad, it was time to get back on the train and avoid that most hellish plague – the Auckland commute.

 The only competitor to bikeshare giant ofo has been told to cease operating in Adelaide, handing the Chinese company an effective monopoly as it lobbies to become a sanctioned private arm of SA’s public transport network.




InDaily can reveal that Singaporean company oBike has removed most of its distinctive, grey-and-yellow hire bicycles from the CBD and North Adelaide after failed to renew its City of Adelaide permit in March.
The Adelaide City Council wrote to oBike this morning, following an inquiry from InDailyyesterday, ordering the company to cease operating as a business within its boundaries and to remove all remaining bicycles from the council’s roads within a week.
The company insists it is yet to decide whether to leave the Adelaide market, but the council says its permit has expired and that oBike has fewer than 10 bicycles left in Adelaide.
“As of today, there are less than 10 oBikes positioned within the Council area, so we believe the company has ceased operating in the City of Adelaide,” a council spokesperson told InDaily this morning.
Competitor ofo has been lobbying the South Australian Government for dedicated bikeshare spaces at train, tram and bus stations, positioning itself as a new, private element of the state’s public transport network.
It has also been lobbying local councils for permission to operate in an expanding area across the state.
OBike’s exit would effectively give ofo a monopoly on the nascent transport mode in Adelaide.
The companies offer GPS-tracked bicycles, which users find using a mobile app, hire at low cost and leave at their destination for the next commuter to use.
The city council has threatened to dispose of oBike’s remaining bicycles if the company fails to remove them.
“Today we have written to oBike to officially state that it must cease operating as a business within the City of Adelaide and to remove any bicycles from council’s roads within a week,” a spokesperson for the council told InDaily this morning.
“In the event that any bicycles are not removed within the specified timeframe, our community safety officers will take action to remove and impound the bicycles and arrange for their appropriate disposal, with any costs being charged to oBike.
“Ofo did renew their permit and continue to operate within permit conditions.”
But an oBike spokesperson told InDaily this afternoon that the company had yet to decide if it was leaving Adelaide, and that: “we are in the preparation stage to fulfill the new permit requirement, i.e. simcard GPS tracking system, and it might take some time”.
Both ofo and oBike started out with 50 bikes when they launched in Adelaide in October last year.
Ofo currently has 200 bikes on the streets of the CBD and North Adelaide “with room to increase”, a spokesperson for the company said.

The number of bicycles allowed in the council’s jurisdiction may be altered, with approval from council staff, in response to changes in demand.
Ofo general manager for Australia, New Zealand and India Dexter Sim told InDaily this afternoon that: “We look forward to continued discussion with the local councils in Adelaide about how we can serve the local community with operational excellence.”
“Our aim is to provide a solution for the last mile commute,and provide a healthy and environmentally friendly way for commuters, families and tourists to travel around the city of Adelaide.”

According to a report in The Advertiser, oBike failed to submit comprehensive monthly reports to the council about the performance of its service earlier this year.
The now-massive global bikeshare industry – which began with a small bikeshare operation at Peking University in 2014 – took a significant hit to its reputation when images of huge piles of abandoned and vandalised, branded bikeshare bikes emerged out of China last year.
The industry also suffered a public relations blow in Australia last year when dozens of oBikes were scooped up from the Yarra River in Melbourne – and some people sought creative ways to dump the bikes, including in trees and on street signs.

Car sharing is regarded by many as the next logical step in the evolution of how we use our mobility solutions. Sharing cars between a number of people definitely seems like a cost-effective solution but implementing it does come with certain hiccups.
MINI is now joining the field, launching a trial peer-to-peer program in Spain. At first, it will be available only in the Madrid metropolitan area and it will allow customers to share their cars with family and friends.
With the new MINI Sharing app, MINI owners can grant friends, family members or colleagues permission to open and start their vehicle via a smartphone. As part of the pilot project in the Spanish capital, this personal form of car sharing is now being tested under everyday conditions.
The peer-to-peer sharing trial is designed for a fleet of up to 500 vehicles. Owners of current MINI models produced since March 2018 will be invited to participate, and their vehicle will be equipped or retrofitted with a MINI Sharing Module that enables access and engine start via smartphone.




“MINI drivers are always ahead of their time, just like their groundbreaking and modern vehicles,” says Sebastian Mackensen, MINI Senior Vice President. “With MINI Sharing, we enable our customers in Spain to participate in the sharing economy.
This new technology fits perfectly with our desirable cars and our innovative customer demographic.” MINI Sharing allows the vehicle owner to share their MINI with up to ten people of their choosing, with the vehicle availability highlighted in the app’s inbuilt calendar function.

The guest drivers can use the app to make a reservation request from their smartphone with just a few taps. After the owner has granted their consent, the location of the vehicle and pedestrian directions are displayed on their phone.
Upon arrival at the vehicle, the smartphone on which the MINI Sharing App is installed becomes the car key. A Bluetooth connection between the smartphone and the MINI makes it possible to open the vehicle doors and start the engine by pressing the start / stop toggle switch.


If desired, the MINI owner can mark specific individuals as VIP users in the MINI Sharing App. These individuals can book the vehicle spontaneously without having to wait for the owner’s consent.
After the guest driver completes their journey, the MINI will be parked in an area agreed with the owner and locked via smartphone. The MINI Sharing App generates a report with the travel data required for billing, and the guest driver is presented with the opportunity to transfer a payment to the MINI owner via PayPal.
The cost calculation for the MINI Sharing App is based on a flat rate of €0.30 per kilometer driven.
Insurance cover for each vehicle can be extended easily, with a lump sum for each additional guest driver participating in the MINI Sharing trial. For data protection reasons, the MINI owner can view the location of their vehicle at any time via the MINI Sharing App – with the exception of instances where another passenger is traveling inside the vehicle.

Earlier this month, the Arlington City Council voted to end the route, and replace it with the ridesharing service Via beginning Dec. 11.
D Magazine said Arlington will become the first U.S. city to convert its entire mass transit operation into so-called micro transit.
Arlington long has fought the distinction of being the largest U.S. city — a population of roughly 393,000 — without a public mass transit system. The Metro Arlington Express single bus route system was supposed to change that, but it never drew many riders.
The city hopes its subsidized one-year pilot project with Via will have better results.

Via riders will pay a $3 flat rate and will need to use the Via app to summon a shuttle.

Via will operate up to 10 vans with room for six passengers each that run from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week, D Magazine reported.
To summon the shared-ride shuttle, riders will need to use the Via app and pay a $3 flat rate for each trip within the service area — the TRE rail station near Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, downtown Arlington, Texas Health Arlington Memorial Hospital, and entertainment options in the east-central area of Arlington.
Later, the service area will expand to include the Parks Mall and the University of Texas at Arlington.
VIA BE LONE MASS TRANSIT OPTION
It’s a bet the city is making that residents will prefer this to buses and trains, and that they will chose Via over Lyft or Uber.

For now, Via would be Arlington’s only mass transit option.
Earlier this year, however, an outfit called the Alliance for Transportation Innovation showed off a self-driving electric trolley system in the city.
Called EasyMile, the shuttle has a top speed of 25 miles per hour. The Alliance has been traveling the country showing off the $250,000, six-seat vehicles that are supposed to have a capacity of 12 people.

Residents of major U.S. cities are becoming used to seeing docks for bike sharing programs nestled into parking spaces or next to subway station entrances. Adorned with stylish branding and corporate sponsors’ logos, these facilities are transforming transportation in cities across the country.
The modern concept of bike sharing—offering bikes for short-term public rental from multiple stations in cities—was launched in Copenhagen in 1995, but U.S. cities only started piloting their own systems in the past decade. Washington, DC led the way, launching SmartBike DC in 2008 and an expanded network called Capital Bikeshare in 2010. This program now boasts more than 480 stations and a daily ridership of 5,700.
Within a few years, bike-share systems launched in Boston, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and dozens of other cities. In 2016 there were 55 systems across the country with more than 40,000 bikes.
And momentum continues to grow. In 2017 Citi Bike in New York City added 2,000 bikes, increasing its fleet to a total of 12,000. San Francisco is expanding its system from just 700 bikes to 7,000, thanks to a sponsorship deal with Ford.

Going Dockless
The newest twist in this rapid expansion is dockless bike sharing, which lets users park bikes anywhere within defined districts and lock and unlock their bikes with smartphone apps. Users don’t have to locate docking stations or worry about whether space will be available at their destination.
These systems also are cheaper to set up, so providers can charge lower user fees. Some dockless bike-share companies offer rides for as little as $1 for the first half hour.
Dockless systems are also helping to address equity issues posed by public dock-based systems, which often are located in more affluent and predominantly white urban neighborhoods. Because dockless systems don’t require stations, they can be rapidly deployed in zones that dock-based systems may be slow to reach.
Students at Beijing University developed this approach in 2014 to improve campus mobility. Dockless bike-share companies have flooded Chinese cities with bikes in the past two years, leading to massive piles of discarded bicycles in public spaces.

Seattle turned to dockless companies to fill the gap after a publicly funded dock bike-share system there failed in 2016. The city could soon have one of the largest bike-share systems in the country.
Cities around Boston that are outside of the service area of Hubway, the area’s public bike-share system, just reached a deal to provide dockless bike-share service, expanding access to hundreds of thousands of people
And in San Francisco, Uber recently purchased Jump Bikes, a dockless electric bike-share startup, and soon will allow users to reserve electric bikes with their Uber app.
If recent examples are any indication, bike sharing in the U.S. will be a mix of complementary dock-based and dockless systems, run by both public entities and private companies. The humble bicycle, aided by smartphone technology, is resurging as an urban transportation option.

EVERY city today wants to become a smart city so they can provide the best solutions and services to their citizens. There’s heavy investment in the field and news of new activity almost every other day.
However, not everyone can win the race. According to ABI Research, Singapore, for now, wins the title of the world’s smartest city.
Singapore scores highest on all innovation criteria with a special focus on Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) and Freight-as-a-Service (FaaS) to maintain its leading role as a transportation and freight hub with driverless taxis, autonomous shuttles and platooning trials and projects.
Additionally, Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative addresses a wide range of urban issues linked to high-density living which has received applause internationally. The Smart City Ranking competitive assessment ranked 10 megacities across developed regions: New York, Los Angeles, Paris, London, Dubai, Beijing, Shanghai, Singapore, Tokyo, and Seoul.
ABI Research analysed each city for its innovative programs, strategies and implementation achievements measured through verifiable metrics for congestion, air quality, GDP, crime rates, and cost of living.
In terms of innovation, cities are assessed on the extent of which they are embracing out-of-the-box thinking and planning to deploy disruptive technologies to fundamentally address the issues and challenges of megacities of the future across areas like mobility, transportation, energy, education, healthcare, and public services.

“Singapore and second-placed Dubai emerge as smart city leaders, excelling in innovation in terms of the adoption of next-generation technologies and disruptive smart city paradigms as structural solutions for hard problems. Dubai is leading the way in the implementation of distributed ledgers with all government transactions to be processed via blockchain technology by 2030,” said Dominique Bonte, Vice President End Markets at ABI Research.
Somewhat surprisingly, Shanghai and Beijing were assessed as laggers, coming in at rank 9 and 10 respectively.
Despite both cities’ efforts to deploy technologies like smart meters and smart grids, bike sharing, vehicle electrification, smart parking, and smart cards, they continue to face formidable issues related to congestion and pollution and trail the other cities on economic development in terms of GDP per capita.
At the same time, both Chinese cities have huge potential to improve their ranking in the future as they continue to evolve their smart cities solutions from basic sensor-centric technologies to more advanced approaches while benefiting from expertise gained during trials in smaller cities in China.

Despite what seems like near-constant gridlock across the city, and Los Angeles’ reputation as an auto-focused metropolis, not everyone who lives here owns a car. That is particularly true in Downtown, where a growing number of individuals have given up their vehicles in favor of mass transit, or families have realized that they can get by with just one car.
So it’s not surprising that a number of alternatives to driving solo have taken hold in Downtown. In addition to the increasing number of people who walk between home and work, Uber and Lyft are commonplace. Bicycles lanes are appearing across the community and the L.A. Department of Transportation is working on an expansion of the DASH bus system.
 The concept of app-fueled car sharing is also taking hold. Getaround, which allows individuals to rent out their personal vehicles, began service in Downtown late last month. Other systems have been operating even longer.

On Friday, April 20, a new player joined the lineup. What sets BlueLA apart is that the city government itself has a stake, and the cars are all electric.
BlueLA is a collaboration between LADOT and Blue Solutions, a car sharing and mobility-focused subsidiary of the French transportation company the Bolloré Group. It seeks to serve a variety of customers, with a special focus on people in low-income communities who only need a car part-time.
The program offers a fleet of compact hatchback-style vehicles built by Bolloré. They are set up at charging hubs around the city, with stations already operating or in the works in Downtown, Koreatown and Echo Park. It is launching with 25 cars and 35 charging stations. All of the cars are four-seat rides with the BlueLA logo painted on the side.




There are currently three BlueLA hubs in Downtown, and each has spots for five charging stations. The vehicles can travel 160 miles on a charge.


Three of the initial seven hubs are in Downtown, with three more expected to open in the Central City in the coming months. The company expects to have 100 vehicles available at 40 locations by the end of the year, and to triple in size by 2021. The service operates 24 hours a day.
Blue Solutions Managing Director Christophe Arnaud said the initial stations were chosen as target areas where people either may not have a car, or where they might walk or bike to work and need a vehicle only for short trips.
“Each station’s location was chosen to support the low-income communities,” Arnaud said.
BlueLA comes in the wake of other cities that have launched their own car-sharing service. Indianapolis partnered with the Bolloré Group to start BlueIndy in 2015. Chicago’s Department of Transportation is exploring a pilot program for a similar service called Car2Go.
The LADOT developed the idea of an affordable, electric car-sharing service and began searching for partners in 2016, according to a department spokesperson.
The service operates on a membership system, with users paying $5 a month for access and 20 cents a minute for a ride (it works out to $12 an hour). People are billed on a credit card tied to their account.
For households of four with an annual income below $45,000, membership is $1 a month, and rides are 15 cents a minute, or $9 an hour. To qualify for the lower rate, users must provide a pay stub or other income statement.
“Our aim was to bring sustainable, accessible solutions to Los Angeles,” said LADOT spokesman Oliver Hou. “This gives everyone freedom of movement while respecting the environment.”
The initial hubs in Downtown Los Angeles are at Sixth and Bixel streets, Glendale and Beverly boulevards, and 11th and Santee streets. There are five charging stations at each location.
Additional hubs are planned for Los Angeles Trade Technical College, the Los Angeles Flower Market and City Hall.
 

The system operates in a manner similar to Metro’s Bike Share program.
To access a vehicle, users press either a Metro TAP card or a BlueLA card to a central kiosk at each hub (BlueLA cards are mailed to users after they register).
The card enables a user to remove the charging cord from a car, unlock it and drive away.
People can use the cars for as long as they want, provided they stay within 25 miles of a charging station and the battery does not run out. The system allows the service to call users and ask them to turn around if they get too far away. When the charge hits 30%, BlueLA notifies the driver to return to a hub.
 The cars can travel 160 miles on a full charge in an urban area, Arnaud said. To end the session, users return the vehicle to a hub, lock it and plug in the charging cord.

Similar to Metro’s Bike Share, an app allows drivers to see where cars are available and book a vehicle in advance. The service provides auto insurance coverage, but it is secondary to a driver’s personal auto insurance. Tickets are the driver’s responsibility, and users must work with BlueLA’s insurance provider in the event of an accident.
The cars have GPS tracking, navigation service on a display screen, and a car-return system that highlights stations that have an available space for drop-off.
BlueLA is one of approximately half a dozen car-sharing services operating in the Los Angeles area. The company Getaround launched in Los Angeles in March, and allows people in Downtown and other neighborhoods to rent out their personal vehicles.
Getaround General Manager James Correa said there is a high demand for car sharing services in the city, and there is room for many options to meet demand. He sees a growing user base in neighborhoods known for congestion and limited parking.
“It’s a trend in general for urban dwellers who are eschewing car ownership,” Correa said. “If there are more providers in the market, it’s good. More people are learning and experimenting with car sharing.”
There are other local options, too. General Motors brought its car-sharing service, Maven, to Downtown in 2016. Then there’s Zipcar, which has a number of stations and a variety of company-owned vehicles around Downtown.

New Zealand bus and transport company Go Bus today marked a Southern Hemisphere first as Savy hit the road in Queenstown.
Using a smart phone app and the efficiencies of ride sharing, Savy will provide on-demand and affordable transport around Queenstown for the introductory flat fare of just $5.
Savy is powered by Via, the leading technology developer and provider of dynamic on-demand shared rides. First launched in 2013, Via powers over 1.5 million rides per month in major cities around the world including New York, Chicago, Washington DC, Paris, and Kent in the UK.
Queenstown is the first location in New Zealand, and indeed the Southern Hemisphere, to get Savy.
Users simply book a ride through the Savy app and are instantly matched with others going their way in a dynamically-routed Savy vehicle.
Savy is also different from other app-driven or shared-ride transport services in that it owns its fleet and employs only fully trained and officially vetted and endorsed drivers.
“Savy combines the ride-sharing efficiency of a bus, with the personal convenience of a taxi, all at an affordable price and in a way that’s quick and easy to use,” explains Calum Haslop, Managing Director of Go Bus, the New Zealand transport operator behind Savy.

“We’re confident Savy fills a gap in the transport options currently available, sitting in a space between traditional public transport, taxis and community carpooling that is now more accessible through technology.
“In Queenstown, Savy answers to the area’s challenges around providing transport offerings that are suitable to both residents and visitors, growing traffic congestion and dwindling carpark availability.

“These challenges are not unique to Queenstown of course, and we see plenty of scope in adopting this global solution to help address local transport issues in other New Zealand centres in future.”
Savy utilises Via’s smart algorithms, which seamlessly match multiple passengers headed in the same direction, and dynamically routes entire vehicle fleets in real time to meet demand. Via also developed the Savy rider and driver mobile applications, as well as state of the art operations management software.
“Our ground-breaking technology transforms public transit from a system of fixed routes and schedules into a dynamic on-demand network.
By allowing more people to share rides, Via is helping reduce congestion and emissions around the world, from New York to Paris, and we are excited to bring this successful model to Queenstown,” says Daniel Ramot, Co-founder and CEO of Via.
Savy officially launches today in Queenstown with a fleet of six Savy vehicles on the go seven days week. Operating times accommodate early starts and late nights out: 6am to 11pm Sunday to Thursday, and 6am to 1am Friday and Saturday.
The current service area covers the Queenstown area including Arthurs Point in the north, Fernhill to the west, Kelvin Heights to the south and east towards Lake Hayes, with plans for expansion in the future. One-way trips are charged direct to the rider’s debit or credit card via the Savy app at an introductory flat fare of $5.
Go Bus is New Zealand’s biggest and most diverse bus operator, with 27 depots spanning the North and South Islands. It is 100% New Zealand-owned by Ngai Tahu Holdings Corporation and Tainui Group Holdings.  
The company offers a full spectrum of bus services, including metropolitan urban routes, school bus services, Special Needs Transport, tour and charter services. Go Bus provides contracted urban bus services to more regional authorities in the country than any other operator.

 It operates a fleet of over 1,700 vehicles, including over 440 dedicated urban service buses, and employs over 2,000 staff.
Via is re-engineering public transit, from a regulated system of rigid routes and schedules to a fully dynamic, on-demand network. Via’s mobile app connects multiple passengers who are headed the same way, allowing riders to seamlessly share a dynamically-routed vehicle
. First launched in New York City in September 2013, the Via platform currently operates in New York City, Chicago, and Washington DC, providing over 1.5 million rides per month, and is growing rapidly. Via also licenses its revolutionary on-demand transit technology to transportation operators, and partners with cities and transit authorities globally.

With Uber already operating, Lyft is looking to hire a general manager and marketing manager for Alberta, according to a job posting.
In a statement Saturday, the San Francisco-based company said they don’t have specific launch plans, but are looking to build a team to one day bring the service to the province.
“We want to bring Lyft’s affordable, reliable rides to Alberta and are beginning the process of building a team in anticipation of an eventual launch,” the statement said.
“While both Calgary and Edmonton would be great fits for Lyft, we have no specific launch plans to share at this time.”
Coun. George Chalal is willing to welcome Lyft into the Calgary market with open arms, but wants to see some disparities in Calgary’s private transportation industry cleared up first.
“The City of Calgary is open for business, but anybody who is looking to come into the industry should be ready and willing to ensure that it’s fair for everybody,” said Coun. George Chalal, who added he sees a disparity of cost, fees and training between the taxi industry and the transportation network companies (TNCs).

“I think we need to reevaluate the whole livery industry, TNC and traditional taxi industry. I’m willing to work with both sides of the industry over the next few months and year to find common ground and solutions which enable everybody to thrive and be successful.”
Chalal also expressed concern about safety issues, given that taxis have camera and audio recording devices, while other ride-sharing options in Calgary do not.
Tentative changes were approved during a April 11 council meeting including eliminating a $141 setup fee charged to taxi drivers for the inspection of meters, along with an increase to the amount of money that cabbies can recoup from patrons who make a mess in a taxi from the current $100 charge to $250.
The rookie northeast councillor said he plans to introduce stiffer regulations for ride hailing companies at Monday’s council meeting.
Like Chalal, Coun. Shane Keating, who serves as the chair for the city’s transportation committee, sees a market for Lyft but also a need to balance differences between companies.
“As we have seen, there is a market for it,” said Keating.
“We still have to balance the difference between the taxi industry and TNC industry. In the long run, it will provide better service to Calgarians.”
According to data from the city, a total of 2,282,276 trips were taken with ride-share companies like Uber in 2017.
Taxi use, meanwhile, continued to decline, with 6,650,069 trips logged in the year, down from a total of 7,022,090 taxi trips in 2016, and 8,404,108 rides in 2014.
The same date found monthly taxi revenues based on distance have decreased, falling from $10,488,078 in September 2015 to $8,876,873 in September 2017.
Lyft announced last year it would begin its expansion into the Canadian market. The company currently operates in hundreds of U.S. markets and in nine Ontario cities that include Toronto and Ottawa.

Drivers in Texas now have another option when it comes to commuting around the state. Waze Carpool opened Monday to drivers statewide in an effort “to not just outsmart traffic, but end it,” as Waze put it.
Drivers with the Waze app can now set up a carpool account that matches them with riders going to a nearby location.
The app pairs drivers with a single rider or a carpool crew and gives the driver directions to a pickup and drop-off spot near the riders’ destination. The best part? The app lets riders reimburse drivers for gas used during the ride.
Those hoping to catch a ride must download an app called Waze Carpool. According to Waze, the carpool matchup service can help you with “making new friends, cutting back on emissions and saving money.”

The program launched in Houston in September after Hurricane Harvey left many Houstonians without vehicles.
The carpool option received positive feedback, so Waze expanded to serve all of Texas.
Carpooling helps protect the environment and lessen traffic. Waze asks that you “tell friends, family, coworkers and more.
Download [the] apps to drive or ride (search “Waze” in your app store) and join the revolution because we all hate traffic, and it’s time to do something about it.”

Easy access to high quality and efficient transportation infrastructure already makes Singapore one of greatest cities in the world to live and work. But the desire to attract the best talent and businesses from around the world has prompted Singapore to embrace a new challenge to become “car-lite” and boost public transport use.

Singapore currently boasts a public transport mode share of 66 per cent.The government’s new target is to achieve a public transport mode share of 75 per cent during peak hours by 2030, and it is investing in improvements to public transport infrastructure.





However, despite substantial effort over many years, Singapore is still seen as being too car centric in comparison to cities like Hong Kong, which has a public transport mode share of 88 per cent.




How can Singapore hit its existing targets and accelerate the change towards a new “car-lite” future? Digital technology could be a big part of the solution.
New technology trends
In a car-lite future, individual car ownership will disappear to make way for public transport and car use as a service. One technology that can help achieve this, as well as   revolutionise several other aspects of life, is Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Autonomous vehicles (AV) are now one of the most talked about products to be driven by AI. Technology giants Google, Tesla and Uber are already testing their fully automated vehicles, and smaller companies like nuTonomy and Delphi are now conducting their respective pilot tests in Singapore.
Singapore leaders predict that within 10 to 15 years the technology will be mature enough to be deployed widely.
The use of AI technology in transport will be dependent on “big data”, a concept which refers to the use of computing technology to process huge amounts of data about things like consumer behaviour, mobility trends, and more.
These technologies will not only directly change our lives by making driverless vehicles a reality, but will also increasingly trigger new business models. For example, people can also harness big data to create solutions for the sharing economy and use the power of data and communication technology to maximise the use of our infrastructure.
In China, for example, real time transport data and information is now made publicly available across the nation’s cities. Mobile phone apps, driven by this real time information, now enable dock-less bicycles to be found, unlocked and shared.
In return, the enormous amounts of travel and behaviour data collected from these apps can help cities to better understand travel patterns, and enable resources to be planned and utilised more efficiently in future.
This has helped communities to abandon cars and traffic jams in favour of a low carbon bicycle transport culture.

In a car-lite future, individual car ownership will disappear to make way for public transport and car use as a service.

Singapore’s transition to a car-lite society
Singapore expects to use similar technology to transform its society to a new “car-lite” model, in tandem with investments in new public transport schemes and the implementation of new strategic plans such as the “Car-lite Sunday” and “Active Mobility Bill” etc., to achieve this goal.

Effective and forward-looking master planning is the key to maximising the benefits of big data and technology.
To achieve the “car-lite” model, the appropriate demand-supply balance of city, i.e., the optimised matching between working/living places and transport infrastructures must first be established.
A good example of this is the design of Singapore’s second Commercial Business District now under construction in the Jurong Lake District, in western Singapore.
A number of major government agencies such as Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and Land Transport Authority (LTA) have already relocated there or are planning to move there, highlighting the way that, with appropriate public transport options, de-centralized urban planning
The use of big data is vital in the planning stage to help city planners understand and target drivers in order to get them to change their transport-related behavior or even shift to public transport, and to optimize the city structure accordingly.
For example, Uber has already published point-to-point real-time travel time information which is aggregated from its huge . As such information and data trends build up; it will offer greater insights for transport planners, such as the locations, types, and frequency of transport services that are needed.
 An efficient and reliable public transport system
Providing good public transport links to connect people to places where they work and live not only drives people out of their cars but is also an efficient and cost-effective way of moving people.
Singapore’s LTA targets to expand its rail network to about 360km by 2030 and to develop a more efficient and integrated bus system that will reduce waiting times and enable seamless transfers for bus commuters.
However, achieving last mile connectivity for public transport passengers – moving people between their homes or work places to main transport nodes such as MRT stations – continues to remain a challenge.
One solution to overcome this last mile challenge could be active mobility—that is, walking or cycling. But this would require persuading people that riding and walking is safe and convenient.
This transition will start in Singapore with newly constructed footpaths and cycle paths along Bencoolen Street, with additional active mobility connections in Singapore’s central region. Three bike sharing service providers, Mobike, Ofo and Obike’s have been launched in Singapore, providing more convenient and cost-effective cycling options on Singapore’s streets.
However, it is not without teething problems, such as the misuse of bikes and indiscriminate parking. Bike-sharing operators, authorities and building owners, will need to work out a practical framework to regulate the new bicycle sharing economy and establish necessary bicycle infrastructure such as designated bicycle parking zones in Singapore.
Digital technology is evolving at the fastest pace ever and is set to transform the way that we live, work and travel.
While some fear that developments such as AI and big data will either replace humans one day or undermine our privacy, in fact they are key to securing our sustainable future and creating models such as a “car-lite” transport system.
As these technologies are deployed to serve global populations, communities will continue to evolve and adapt to the new opportunities as they are presented. By upgrading ourselves with this new knowledge, and by thinking globally and systematically, we can make our environment more car-lite, more sustainable and a more attractive place to live.

New Zealanders keen to save extra cash to fill up the Christmas stockings or after a set of wheels to get from A to B during the festive season may find the solution lies within an innovative peer-to-peer car-sharing community.
Yourdrive.co.nz, dubbed ‘the AirBnB of car rentals’, is leading the way for car-sharing in New Zealand, giving Kiwis increased options around car use. Yourdrive is built on the ‘sharing economy’ model, and connects a flourishing database of car renters with car owners in nearby neighbourhoods.
Yourdrive founder Oscar Ellison is focused on making car rental experiences personable, convenient and accessible to everyone.
“What we’ve found is that a lot of people are moving away from car ownership as they live in more dense areas, have better access to public transport or don’t want the ongoing costs that come with owning their own vehicles.

They enjoy having the freedom to select a car they’d like to drive and renting directly from locals, whenever they need a car.
Whether it be a day trip, a Christmas shopping excursion, or a summer holiday getaway, there is a growing shift towards car sharing globally,” says Ellison.
“With the holiday season just around the corner, New Zealand car owners have a convenient way to make money off their vehicles when they aren’t using them – they can turn an idle ride into an earning asset.”
 Using the online platform, people can search for vehicles located in areas they are travelling to, or rent from locals in their neighbourhood.

They then meet at an agreed location to hand over the keys, which often also leads to the exchange of local knowledge and journey tips.
While car sharing is practical, and provides a sense of community, the advantages don’t stop there – it can be a lucrative side-earner. Depending on the value, make and model of a vehicle (which determines the recommended rental rate), an owner could earn up to $10,000 a year by renting out their car through Yourdrive.
The rewards are already starting to be seen on a large scale – collectively, over $500,000 has been made by car owners that have rented out their cars through Yourdrive since the website first launched two years ago.
For renters, the savings is also significant. They don’t have to foot the bills associated with vehicle ownership; purchasing a car, registration, WOF, servicing, maintenance and fuel costs. People can rent cars they dream of owning – whether it be by the hour, day, week or longer for summer road trips – or simply stick to wheels on a budget to get around town.
“Whatever their budget and desires, people will find the right car for their needs within the community,” says Ellison. “We’re finding many millennials who enjoy an urban lifestyle without owning a car still have the freedom of renting a car for a day excursion to the beach or countryside or to visit friends and family.”
Car-sharing also has numerous environmental benefits – for every car shared, there is a reduction in the number of owned vehicles on the road – by around 10-15. With latest figures from the NZ Transport Agency showing that there are 800 new vehicles each week registered in Auckland alone, renting cars that are already registered could assist in easing congestion on the roads.
“This not only helps provide a solution to our country’s traffic problems, but it’s also kinder on the environment – helping to reduce greenhouse gases produced during the manufacturing of new vehicles,” says Ellison.
The concept for Yourdrive was borne out of Ellison’s frustrations with the high cost of car ownership after he returned to Auckland from his O.E.
The young entrepreneur launched Yourdrive in 2015 and it quickly caught the attention of transport company JUCY, which bought a 50 percent share in Yourdrive last year and now offers car sharing as an alternative transport option to its rental car fleet.

“New Zealand has one of the highest rates of car ownership in the world*, and cars often sit unused in garages and driveways around the country, so this provides a win-win solution.”
Today, Yourdrive has more than 450 cars live on its platform and on an average day, 40 cars are shared via the platform.
During peak times of the year, more than 250 cars booked through Yourdrive are on the road at any one time, while owners have peace of mind knowing their cars are covered by comprehensive insurance while in use.
Before joining, each driver is screened to ensure they have a valid driver licence, and a five-star review system works both ways for renters and car owners.
“There’s been a huge shift from traditional business models to peer-to-peer business models in recent years,” says Ellison.
“We’ve seen the rise and success of Bookabach and Airbnb, and now Yourdrive is helping keep people in New Zealand mobile. It’s about generating new streams of revenue for car owners while giving drivers more freedom to get around our beautiful country.”

Following the arrival of self-service bikes, the company decided to introduce  to the economic capital in order to tackle the traffic issue in the city.
The deal for the self-service scheme was finalised when Karim Ghellab, former Minister of Transportation, joined the venture as an associate.
Ghellab’s investment fund, Massir Invest, signed the venture which allowed the launch in October 2017.
Carmine was founded in 2014 and “reached maturity” according to Alaoui in 2015, when it piloted its first project.
“People thought the concept wouldn’t work in Morocco, to judge by the time it took us to go into commercial operation,” stated Mohamed Mrani Alaoui, CEO and Founder of Carmine.
“But that pilot period was about making the new service more effective. And then, the hardest part was to find funding. I started out alone with my own savings and we were extra careful until we found investors.”
During that year the startup had to run trials on rates, define parking spaces through a partnership with the city, personalise technology, and understand client needs.
Rates for hiring share vehicles cost Dh30 (US$3) per hour, plus Dh1 per kilometre.
Carmine will also offer subscriptions – including fuel, insurance, and parking – charging Dh290 (US$30.77) for a quarter Dh890 (US$94.42) for a full year.

Beijing-based bike-sharing company Ofo is set to launch its service in Israel this week. The service will be available in Ramat Gan, a city adjacent to Tel Aviv, the City of Ramat Gan announced.
Chinese bike-sharing company, Beijing Mobike Technology Co. Ltd., announced Monday it would launch a free pilot program on the Tel Aviv University Campus. As part of the pilot, hundreds of shared bikes will be positioned on the university’s campus.
500 bicycles by Ofo will be positioned throughout Ramat Gan, as well as inside the Sheba Medical Center and the Bar-Ilan University in the city.
Ofo’s intention to enter the Israeli market was first reported by Calcalist in July.

Founded in 2014, Ofo operates over 10 million bikes in 250 cities worldwide and has some 200 million users. Unlike similar services in Europe and the U.S., Ofo’s operational model does not include docking stations, and users unlock the bike by entering a code into an app on their phones. In July, Ofo raised $700 million in a funding round led by Alibaba.
Imri Galai, CEO of Ofo Israel, said in a statement that Ofo bikes would be available in additional cities in Israel in upcoming months.
Mobike offers a station-free bike sharing service operated via a smartphone app. Founded in 2015, Mobike operates in over 200 cities worldwide and has tens of millions of users.
In 2017, the company began operating outside China in Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, Italy, the Netherlands, Australia, and the U.S. Mobike has raised nearly $1 billion in investments in 2017 and is backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd.

Mobile announced its intention to enter the Israeli market in February, partnering with Israeli car-sharing company Car2Go Ltd.
Mobike has already imported 2,500 bikes to Israel and expects to operate thousands of bike across Israel within the year.

In a February statement, Mobike said its service would initially be offered in the towns of Rishon LeZion and Rehovot in central Israel, and in the Krayot town cluster in the country’s north.
Mobike also said it would not be offered in the Tel Aviv area, where the city’s bike-sharing service Tel-O-Fun is already operating.

Zipcar’s Organizational Overview 
Zipcar is a subsidiary of Avis Budget Group which acquired it in 2013. Originally Zipcar was founded by Antje Danielson and Robin Chase in 2000. Zipcar’s famous tagline: “Wheels when you want them” comes from the early days and is contributed to Robin Chase.  Today’s slogan has slightly changed to “Own the trip, not the car” but still points to the service Zipcar offers: the convenience of a car to easily get to where you want to be without having to worry about the responsibilities and hassles of car ownership such as maintenance and repairs.
Today over a million people across 500+ cities and towns globally have access to over 12,000 Zipcars. Like most station-based carsharing organizations, Zipcar offers a large variety of different vehicle makes and models, including: hybrids, SUVs, pickup trucks, luxury vehicles, minivans, and cargo vans. To be a member of Zipcar’s program there is a membership fee and usage fee for when you rent the vehicle. Originally, membership costs was setup as an annual fee ($300) but the original founder adjusted to $70/year or $7/month to make it affordable to most members. If members book a vehicle, they are charged on an hourly ($7.50) or daily ($69) basis, a cost effective alternative to car ownership. Typical to the carsharing industry these rates include gas, insurance, maintenance and dedicated parking spots where the cars “live”.

Part of Zipcar’s popularity stems from its strategy to target students and build strong connections with colleges and campuses worldwide.To date, Zipcar can be found at over 600 campuses and colleges. Zipcar successfully targets students because it provides significant discounts rates for them. This widely successful program was introduced under Scott Griffith who took the helm of Zipcar in 2003.
While the two original founders realized very early on that technology was needed to run a carsharing business successfully, Griffith also helped lead the development of Zipcar’s technology into the FastFleet system. This was a crucial component to Zipcar’s success in providing a convenient carsharing service. Before Avis acquired Zipcar, this was one of the revenue streams and Zipcar was one of the first carsharing organizations worldwide to release an iphone app (2009). FastFleet set a benchmark for all carsharing organizations and was one of the reasons why Avis was interested in buying Zipcar.
In recent years, Zipcar has expanded its business model from the traditional round trip station based carsharing and was offering one-way car sharing from A to B and free-floating in select cities. However, the A to B model seemed less successful and so earlier this year Zipcar closed its One>Way program in Seattle and only kept Boston open. Brussels, Zipcar’s free-floating city (which runs on Vulog’s technology not FastFleet) is still operational. Zipcar is also experimenting with commuter pricing plans where members get a Zipcar and a parking spot from Monday to Friday and only have to pay a monthly fee ($250/month plus $0.45/mile driven).
Zipcar Carsharing Case Study
How Zipcar Was Born
Zipcar was the brainchild of Antje Danielson, a Harvard geochemist who studied the chemical composition of the atmosphere and became increasingly worried about the world her children would inherit. In an interview with The Verge, Danielson said, ” what I saw [in academia] was a lot of theory, but no application.” She wanted to change her focus from the Earth’s past to its present, and to start a company with an environmental focus. So when she met Robin Chase, an MIT Business school graduate, the two decided to give it a try and founded Zipcar. The two founders described themselves as conscious consumers which explains why the original marketing messages of Zipcar were heavily focused on the positive environmental impact carsharing has.
Chase and Danielson took inspiration from a study involving Switzerland’s Mobility Cooperative, the oldest  car-sharing company in the world. Mobility was different from those already operating in the US because it had a lot more traction in the 90s with with 17,400 customers and over 700 vehicles. Mobility also focused on technology very early on, where its inhouse fleet management software allowed members to access cars without constant key-swapping.
While the first years of Zipcar were focused on growing the company and building technology, the early 2000s were full of changes. In 2001, Danielson was let go of Zipcar because of her lack of involvement and missing experience in running operations. Two years later, and after several rounds of investment funding that Chase couldn’t raise, Scott Griffith took over and Chase was also removed from the company. Griffith took a much more aggressive and systematic approach in growing the company and in 2007, Zipcar was finally able to merge with one of the largest US carsharing companies on the West Coast – Flexcar. Part of that deal was due to the brilliant negotiations of Steve Case, CEO of Revolution a venture firm with investments focused on the sharing economy. The merger with Flexcar was part of the reason why Zipcar was valued at $170mio for the 2011 IPO.
In 2013, Zipcar was acquired by Avis for just under $500 mio. Avis saw potential in applying Avis Budget’s experience and efficiencies of fleet management with Zipcar’s customer-friendly technology. In fact, since the acquisition Zipcar’s technology is proprietary and exclusive to Avis and its own brands.
Zipcar’s Strengths
Geographical reach
Zipcar has become the best known station-based carsharing service in North America. Its geographical footprint is large, predominantly in the US but it is also present in Canada, France, Spain, Belgium, the UK, Taiwan and Turkey. With over a million members it serves as many people as the largest free-floating competitors, car2go which is backed by Daimler (Daimler recently merged with BMW ReachNow). The size and geographical reach is beneficial for all Zipcar members because it allows members to travel easily from city to city under the same membership in other markets. It can be particularly beneficial when members travel to foreign countries because it provides members the comfort of a familiar brand and members know how to use the service.
Cost Savings for members
Carsharing is generally a much more cost-effective option for people than personal vehicle ownership. In 2017, AAA estimated that owning and operating a new vehicle costs approximately $706/month, Zipcar claims that their members spend on average just over 100$/month (including their monthly membership).
To help members save costs, Zipcar has recently introduced a new membership model: the commuter plan. Vehicle utilization for most station-based carsharing services is low during the week. So it made perfect sense for Zipcar to introduce the Commuter Plan: For $250/month, members can have access to an economy vehicle from Monday to Friday. The key selling factor is the parking spot that is included: in cities like Seattle or Boston a monthly parking stall is often between $250 – 500/month depending on location. With Zipcar Commute, members have a dedicated reserved stall downtown and close to their workplace. In fact, the new plan is even attractive to “untypical” carshare members: we interviewed super users (people that have more than one carsharing membership) in Seattle recently and one father of 2 who owns his own business and two cars has subscribed to Zipcar Commute because of the free parking stall.
Less Vehicle Ownership and VMTs in Cities
Most cities in North America have a transportation plan that focuses around sustainability and using environmentally friendly modes to reduce emissions. This means that many cities pay special attention to active transportation, such as biking and walking, and removal of vehicles in their cities. One of the biggest benefits of carsharing for cities is that it supports their transportation plans because carsharing impacts behaviour positively. These impacts have been researched extensively and Zipcar in particular has been the focus of many of these studies. The four main questions these studies try to answer are:

How many personally owned vehicles are removed from the road for each carsharing vehicle?
Do carsharing members travel less miles/km (VMT) than regular car owners?
How do VMTs of carsharing members and the more gas efficient fleets impact green house gas emissions?
How much space is saved in cities that can now be used for parks etc because there are less parked vehicles?

Zipcar has a popular graphic on their website that summarises the numbers the findings.

Zipcar’s Revenue Model and Costs
The last publicly available financial report of Zipcar is from 2012, where Zipcar reported just over $275 million in revenue and a net profit for the first time in Zipcar’s history.
The main revenue sources were vehicle usage and fees from the US, Canada, Spain and Austria. Zipcar’s US locations accounted for the majority of all revenues. Vehicle usage – the booking of Zipcars charged on an hourly rate – accounted for 62% of the total revenue. Fees revenue includes annual and monthly membership fees, as well as application fees and damage waivers. Fees were 15.5% of the total revenue for 2012. The other 22.5% of revenue were either incurred through interest, the sale of Zero Emission Vehicle credits or through the software as a service licensing fees of Zipcar’s fleet management solution, FastFleet.

Costs
Carsharing is an asset intensive business and costs to manage fleet and members are often underestimated. To illustrate this, when Chase was still CEO she admitted that the real costs were much higher than she had modelled originally. This is a phenomena not uncommon. movmi sees this  all the time in our work which is why we built a financial model that helps our clients cover all cost and assumptions.
In 2012, Zipcar’s fleet operations accounted for 63.6% of all operating costs. The rest was either due to marketing & sales and general administration (25.2%) or member services and fulfillment (7.3%). Marketing & Sales costs increased in 2012 mainly due an increase in workforce. At the end of 2012, Zipcar employed 553 full-time employees, including 169 in fleet operations and support, 118 in member services, 93 in sales and marketing, 52 in engineering and 121 in general and administrative functions. It is also interesting to know that the average cost per member to join the program was between $54 and $89. This number only includes marketing & sales activities, it does not include the application processing costs (a cost that is normally charged back to members as a one-time application fee). It is crucial to understand that a large amount of marketing & sales dollars have to be spent to grow the membership base and then ultimately utilisation of vehicles.
The last 3.9% were incurred by research and development and amortization. Zipcars gross margin was 5.1%, prior to being acquired by Avis in 2013.
Zipcar’s Operation
As you can see from the financials, margins are tight which means efficient operations are imperative for any carsharing organization. Another reason why smooth operations are important is because they have to be able to deliver a high quality member experience. Zipcar originally focused on making its operations scalable through substantial investment in refining, innovating and improving their operations and fleet management software, FastFleet. FastFleet was designed to deal with the daily tasks for fleet managers as well as the member service team. It integrated vehicle usage data and member feedback and generated daily task lists for cleaning and regular maintenance. The call center utilized the same system to troubleshoot any issues members may have during a rental. The system also provided reporting capability, enabling Zipcar’s General Managers to monitor and compare performance metrics across vehicle types, vendors and fleet teams.
Another area, Zipcar invested early on was the analysis and understanding of usage trends. Zipcar quickly realized that the number and placement of vehicles in their fleet is based upon seasonal demands. Like most station-based carsharing services, demand is generally higher in spring and summer which is why Zipcar adds vehicles to the fleet during those months and decreases them during the winter. This is an area where rental car providers also have a lot of understanding so it made a lot of sense for Avis to combine forces with Zipcar.
Zipcar locations are managed by local General Managers and Fleet Teams. While the General Manager grows the market and is responsible for sales and business development, the Fleet Manager looks after planning and coordinating vehicle service as well as placement of vehicles. The General Manager deals with promotional teams that attend events or setup booths in the streets of a city. They also deal with the local authorities to obtain special parking permits (if possible) and manage the relationships with the universities and colleges. The Fleet Manager has a team of fleet associates but also engages and manages a network of third-party service providers (such as service shops, parking providers and mobile cleaning vendors).
Further Thoughts 
While we are inspired by Zipcar’s overall success and progress over the past 18 years, there is one area where they have lost their pioneering status in recent years. Recently, movmi conducted a competitive benchmarking study and found that while Zipcar used to be at the forefront of using technology to manage members and fleet, their technology and innovation has stagnated since Avis acquired the company in 2013. It is sad to see that, in fact, Zipcar is now lagging behind when it comes to a seamless member experience that is enabled by technology. The table below summarizes movmi’s findings from the benchmarking study of the four largest services in Seattle:

How Zipcar Compared to the Competition:

The registration process is slow and full of friction: our testers had to email paperwork and generally waited up to 2 weeks to be fully approved.
The booking and unlocking of the vehicle was a mix between using the app and holding an RFID card against the windshield. It was confusing most of our testers because all other services allow for an app only experience.
Last but not least, we found that wayfinding (the ability to find the parking stalls at the beginning or end of a trip) was done poorly. The location descriptions in the app were wrong and when our testers called customer service, the agents had wrong information in their system too.

The recent introduction of the Commuter Plan at least suggests that Zipcar is rethinking its business model and creating innovative and cost-effective solutions for their members again. Which hopefully means that Zipcar will also tackle some of the shortfalls of their member experience and invest in some technological upgrades soon.

General Motors (GM) seeks to ease the commuting woes experienced not only by Filipinos but also by citizens of every major metropolis around the world by addressing the challenge of reducing ‘crashes, pollution and congestion’.
In a recently concluded press conference in Shanghai, China, Chairman and CEO Mary Barra disclosed the automaker’s road map for the future of personal mobility – electrification, autonomous vehicles, and connectivity and shared mobility services.
The Chevrolet Bolt EV is GM’s answer to electrification. An electric vehicle that has a 383-kilometer ranger per charge and serves as the automaker’s platform for their future EVs.


In China, GM plans to roll out 10 new energy vehicles (NEVs) from now until 2020 and these include the Cadillac CT6 Plug-In, the Buick Velite 5 extended-range electric vehicle and the Baojun E100 electric vehicle.
By 2025, nearly all GM models will offer electrification technology, from Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet.
“Our modern-day leadership in electrification is not new. Our engineers have continually built upon our experience,” said Barra.
With advanced technology called Super Cruise, GM aims to pave the way for state-of-the-art autonomous vehicles. It is a hands-free driving assistance technology that will be rolled out late this year in the Cadillac CT6 and in future models under the Cadillac marque in China.
GM is also the first automaker to use mass-production methods for self-driving vehicles by manufacturing 130 autonomous test units equipped with its next-generation self-driving technology at their Orion Assembly Plant in Michigan.
The Detroit automaker has also pushed for connectivity in automobiles for more than 20 years and has divulged plans to implement it in Cadillac, Buick and Chevrolet models in China connected by 2020.

By using Vehicle to Everything (V2X), GM is also helping push China’s V2X application layer standard and has also helped author the China Intelligent and Connected Vehicle Road Map, which is used by the government to develop future policy and guidelines for R&D of automakers.

Working in tandem with car-sharing provider Yi Wei Xing and a vehicle sharing pilot program with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, GM also seeks to understand vehicle sharing in a real-world setting and how it will help reduce congestion in major cities around the world.
“GM and our joint ventures are committed to providing world-class products for our customers in China, as well as the technical and business expertise to lead in the future of personal mobility.
No single company or organization has all the answers to the challenges we currently face or expect to face in the future. By working together, we can solve these challenges and deliver safer, better and more sustainable transportation solutions for all of our customers,” said Barra.

Overcoming key barriers to vehicle electrification in India’s passenger mobility sector presents an enormous challenge for India—and also a tremendous economic opportunity, said a study.
India can leapfrog the western mobility paradigm of private-vehicle ownership and create a shared, electric and connected mobility system, saving 876 million metric tons of oil equivalent, worth $330 billion (Rs 20 lakh crore) and 1 giga-tonne of carbon-dioxide emissions by 2030.
A FICCI – Rocky Mountain Institute report titled ‘Enabling India’s Transition to Electric Mobility’ was released by union minister Nitin Gadkari at a conference on smart mobility, arranged by FICCI in New Delhi.
Using a collaborative approach, coordinated action and the strategies and solutions in this report, India can overcome key barriers to EV adoption and potentially become a global leader in electric mobility.
Estimates indicate that India’s urban population will nearly double in the next decade, to approximately 600 million in 2030 and forecasts suggest that by then India’s urban population will take almost 500 million trips per day. While this rapid growth presents major policy and business challenges for India’s public and private sectors, respectively.
It also presents an enormous economic opportunity.
Optimising e-mobility use for everyday life with greater thrust on use of public transport, e-vehicles, metro solutions and shared rides as means for mass transit could also prove game-changers in addressing the issue of air pollution in urban areas.
If India is successful in reaching its EV target, the market could be enormous. Even under a shared mobility paradigm, over 46,000,000 vehicles (two-, three-, and four wheelers) could be sold in 2030. This annual market size would present an opportunity for Indian companies to become leaders in EV technology on a global scale, said a press release.
By 2027, 4-wheel EV sales may exceed 4-wheel internal combustion engine (ICE) sales. After this intersection point, 4-wheel EV sales will grow rapidly, with nearly 16 million 4-wheel EV sales in 2030. While achieving 100% EV sales by 2030 is challenging, doing so would create a major business opportunity for automakers. Realizing this goal would have a significant impact on India’s vehicle stock, with a nearly equal split between ICEs and EVs by 2030 in the 4-wheel segment.

One by one, the main barriers to EV adoption — price, selection, range, charging, and consumer awareness — are falling due to steeply falling technology costs, business model innovation, and increasing connectivity.
India can accelerate its EV adoption by addressing these key challenges through a whole-systems approach.
“The FICCI-RMI report on ‘Enabling the Transition to Electric Mobility in India’ highlights the way forward to accelerate electric mobility in India while addressing the key areas of shared mobility services, interoperable transport data, EV charging infrastructure and manufacturing,” said K Ramchand, chairman, FICCI national committee on infrastructure and managing director, IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd.
Amory Lovins, co-founder and chief scientist, Rocky Mountain Institute said, “Recently, global solar PV and battery prices have dropped 80% in five years.
Signs indicate that the pace of India’s energy transformation could be astonishing: the nation singlehandedly reduced the cost of LEDs by 80% in one year, and the government of India has set its sights on an ambitious target of 100% electric vehicles by 2030.”

Cartrack Holdings, the listed fleet management, vehicle recovery and insurance telematics group, has started experimenting with smart mobility in partnership with two of the world’s leading companies in pay-as-a-service transportation.
Zak Calisto, the global chief executive of Cartrack, said yesterday this reconfirmed the value of an eco-system platform for connected vehicles regardless of the vehicle brand.
Calisto said Cartrack saw this as a strengthening of the value proposition of telematics companies, particularly those with stable, proven and dynamic platforms.
“This will in the future leverage both OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and third-party telematics devices to provide decision-useful information,” he said.
Calisto added that customers were ever-more demanding and reliant on the telematics market to optimise business intelligence relating to assets and people.

He said Cartrack would continue to become a more integral part of its current and future customers’ lives, which would require continued investment in technology, information management, human resources, as well as distribution and operating capacity in current and new markets.


Cartrack has a footprint in 24 countries across Africa, Europe, North America, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.
It grew its base by 25percent to more than 750000 active subscribers in the year to February, which the group claimed ranked it among the largest telematics companies globally.
Cartrack yesterday reported a 17percent growth in headline earnings a share to 100cents in the year to February from 85.4c in the previous year.
Revenue increased by 16percent to R1.32billion from R1.14bn.
Subscription revenue rose by 19percent to R1.17bn to account for 88percent of total revenue.
Revenue was negatively impacted by the strengthening in the value of the rand.
If the exchange rate had remained unchanged from the previous year, revenue would have increased by 18percent to R1.34bn.
Operating profit rose by 18percent to R434million from R369m.
Cash generated from operating activities increased by 21percent to R467m.

 
A dividend of 46c a share was declared for the full year, which was 16percent lower than the 55c dividend declared for the previous year.
Subscriptions
Calisto said that the South African segment had delivered particularly strong results, with subscription revenue increasing year-on-year by 18percent, while its subscriber base grew by 26percent.
He said that the South African market, particularly in the lower-value vehicle segment, remained under-penetrated, and that it had launched a first-to-market insurance offering for vehicle theft that targeted the previously uninsured market.
Calisto said that, according to the Automobile Association of South Africa, as much as 70 percent of the more than 12million registered vehicles in South Africa were uninsured.
“Leveraging its 91percent recovery rate, wealth of insurance telematics data and its investment in research and development, Cartrack is able to offer theft-only car insurance at R9.99 per month, subject to terms and conditions, if a Cartrack telematics device is installed,” he said.
Calisto said that this also placed Cartrack in the unique position to offer customers of this theft-only insurance product the best comprehensive insurance premiums by providing insurance companies with the necessary driver analytics, enabling them to offer the optimal insurance quote.
“In this way, Cartrack will continue to become a more integral part of its current and future customers’ lives,” he said.
Calisto said that, despite global economic and foreign exchange volatility, Cartrack expected to continue double-digit subscriber and revenue growth in the foreseeable future.

Dozens of cities, from Chicago to Paris to Shanghai, have rolled out bike-share programs over the past decade to relieve pressure on automobile-clogged roadways and overtaxed public-transportation systems—and to potentially improve public health through cleaner air and more-active residents.
The still-young bike networks face questions about how best to grow and evolve: Should they add more bikes, or more bike-docking stations at popular spots? Should they expand into new neighborhoods?
Research into London’s bike-share system by Columbia University’s Fanyin Zheng, Columbia PhD candidate Pu He, Chicago Booth’s Elena Belavina, and Cornell Tech’s Karan Girotra suggests that its organizers could improve the flow within the existing network to boost usage, in part by focusing on the most-trafficked routes, rather than expand its geographic footprint.
The findings may help other bike-share systems optimize their networks.
The researchers were motivated by a 2012 request by the boroughs of Islington and Hackney, north of London’s city center, to have the local bike-share program (popularly known as Boris Bikes, for onetime London mayor Boris Johnson) expand their way.
Zheng and her colleagues created a model to estimate the impact that such route expansions might have for the entire bike-share network.
They conclude that increasing the system’s reach would boost the overall usage of the network by 1.5 percent during rush hours. By comparison, increasing the number of docking stations at the beginning and end points of the most popular routes already in the system would be 10 times more effective in boosting network-wide usage than expanding into Islington and Hackney.

The researchers moved beyond a standard approach that focuses on traffic into and out of individual bike-docking stations in isolation. (While there is a growing experimentation with dockless bike sharing, many bike-share programs, including London’s, use docking stations, where the bikes are parked throughout the network when not in use.)
Recognizing that a potential bike-share rider is motivated to use the system based on the ease at both the start and end point of her route, the researchers built their model based on station pairs: routes from Point A to Point B during the high-traffic weekday rush hours. Their goal was to explore how improving usability along those routes might affect other stations.
One of their central findings lends weight to the notion that networks should abandon the practice of spacing docking stations uniformly, in favor of putting more docking stations in zones where routes are most heavily trafficked.
The London bike-share system currently mandates that there must be docking stations every 300 meters or so, but that nod to uniform convenience creates system mismatches. In a city such as London, the most popular routes are used by weekday commuters who come into the city center in the morning and leave at night.
All the stations in between the most popular start and finish points—at intervals of no more than 300-meters—are underutilized, while users who want to park at a popular hub may find it filled to capacity.
“Our analysis suggests that the uniform density rule is much too rigid. A redistribution of stations from the peripheries of the coverage area to the city center would make the current network far more efficient, if efficiency is judged by overall usage,” the researchers write.

The Cold War gave birth to the national highway system and the internet and, in earlier times, economic competitiveness motivated the building of the US system of canals and the laying of the nation’s rail lines. All were products of government forethought and action. Even though a massive upfront investment in treasure made these projects possible, the government expected and even encouraged their eventual privatization save one: the US road network. However, autonomous vehicles may cause a rethink of that too.
In the early 1800s, the US government began selling large parcels of land to encourage and allow for the growth of rail networks across the young, rapidly expanding nation. The result, however, was an odd mix of many short and unconnected lines. Things changed with the Civil War, as a massive consolidation in the ownership and organization of these disparate rail networks was made possible by, among other things, new financing tools like railway bonds. Though state and local governments helped subsidize these new rail lines, they never owned or maintained them. The belief then, as now, was that large private rail companies possessed plenty of self-interest, motivation and resources to maintain and enhance the ever-growing rail networks.
Over a hundred years later, ARPA, or the Advanced Research Projects Agency (Now DARPA), within the US Defense Department, believed a national communication network was needed that could withstand the devastation of a nuclear attack and also allow researchers to communicate and collaborate across vast distances. The concept of the internet was born and ARPA committed the necessary substantial tax dollars to build the foundational computing and communication infrastructure for what we all rely on today.
In these early days, the basic building blocks of the internet were the many government-sponsored NAPs, or network access points. Again, despite the massive upfront investment, the US Defense Department always intended the privatization of the Internet and, as expected, the NAPs and other assets were ultimately transferred to commercial providers. The creators of the internet believed, like their rail road predecessors, that large private players would be ready and able to build and maintain this new, critical asset.
The national highway system would be different. With a small handful of exceptions, the maintenance of the US road network remains a public responsibility. It was President Dwight Eisenhower who, having previously lead a large caravan of military vehicles across the US as a young Army officer, helped bring about the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which gave birth to the transcontinental national highway system we use today.
Interestingly, unlike rail, canals and the internet, however, our national paved road network was initiated, to a large extent, by private investors. It was an eclectic group of leaders of the so-called ‘Good Roads’ movement at the turn of the last century that believed the automobile was a phenomenon that would rapidly sweep across the country and require a dramatic improvement in the number and quality of roads. They were right and rather than wait for the public sector to act, private investors took it upon themselves to help build roads like the ‘Dixie’ and ‘Lincoln’ highways that stretched, north and south and east and west respectively, across the US.
The burden of maintaining the entire US road network remains with the public sector, as tens of millions of car owners, commercial vehicle operators and others contribute funds, through various taxing mechanisms, to maintain a national paved road network of four million centerline miles with an estimated replacement value of over $6T. Regrettably, a recent report by Smart Growth for America estimates the US must spend $45 billion simply to bring the national highway network into good repair while also maintaining the existing road network. Even larger sums will be needed to bring the remaining 80 percent of the US urban and rural road network up to a minimum standard. The total investment required is daunting and the potential source of tax dollars for it remain illusive.
Yet, the autonomous vehicle could remedy difficult situation. In the consensus scenario of the future autonomous vehicle, individual car ownership will effectively disappear as we move to Mobility-as-a-Service (MasS), of which Uber and Lift are the proto-form, where you and I pay-as-you-ride for your private transportation. In this (emerging) scenario, the 260 million registered vehicle owners in the US will shrink to, say, a few dozen MaaS-type autonomous fleet operators, perhaps including familiar firms like Ford, Toyota and Daimler, as well as a yet to be born start-ups. According to a recent study by Strategy Analytics, this MaaS market coult be the a $7T market in the coming years.

These MaaS companies will, in turn, have the size, margins, self-interest and even data to dramatically improve the quality of our road, as quality roads will matter (a lot) to autonomous vehicles.
First, the wear-and-tear out of pocket cost of bad roads alone should be sufficient motivation, MaaS companies will then absorb these costs directly. And that is a big number. According to the insurance industry, that bad roads cost US motorists $109 billion annually.
Second, better roads mean safer autonomous vehicles. According to Andrew Ng, one of the world’s leading machine learning experts, one of the most important qualities of a roadway – for human and non-human driver alike – is predictability. Dr. Ng is adamant that most of the world’s roadways simply don’t make the grade. “The problem with poorly maintained roads is not only that they’re harder to navigate,” he asserted in a recent Wired article, Self-Driving Car Won’t Work Until We Change Our Roads. “[B]ut that computers and humans are no longer able to accurately anticipate where others will drive, thus reducing predictability,” he added.
Last, just like the Pennsylvania Railroad and ISPs of yesteryear and yesterday, MaaS firms will not only have the economic wherewithal to effect improvements in roadways but, as important, they will have the best data. The AV’s sensing tools like LIDAR, Radar, and image processing that allows them to move around safely in the world will also, coincidently, have the most precise, freshest and most relevant data about condition of the roads their using.
In fact, is it out of the realm of possibility that the privatization that happened with other critical infrastructure in prior years in the US could also happen with the nation’s road network? It is a controversial and seemingly impossible thing to consider. Yet it is a question that only something as large and transformative as the autonomous vehicle can answer.

Indian urban planners will learn from their foreign counterparts in the Urban mobility conference held at Hyderabad for three days starting Saturday.
Case studies of many foreign cities including France Switzerland, Brazil, Portugal and others will be discussed in detail in the event which will be attended by about 1,000 policy makers including mayors, administrators, experts, urban planners, researchers and technology and service providers from over 20 Indian States and foreign countries.
Officials said that Hyderabad was decided as the venue for the tenth Urban mobility Conference by M Venkaiah Naidu last year when he was the Union Minister of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation and he will inaugurate the event on Saturday.
UMI Conference aims at promoting dissemination of information and exchange of ideas on urban transport and mobility issues and the best practices being followed in the cities across the world. At the Hyderabad Conference, initiatives and experiences in respect of various aspects of urban transport of 86 cities including 36 foreign cities will be presented as case studies for detailed discussion.

Case studies of foreign cities to be discussed include Boudeau and Lyon (France), Lausanne (Switzerland), Lisbon (Portugal), Guadalajara (Mexico), Curitiba (Brazil), Bangkok (Thailand), Santiago (Chile), Constantine (Algeria), Cape Town (South Africa), Rabat (Morocco), Dhaka (Bangladesh) and others.
Indian city case studies to be presented and discussed include three relating to Hyderabad including road safety aspects, transit oriented development and Introduction of tram services besides Parking Policy, planning and Implementation in Vijayawada, initiatives and experiences of Mysuru, Bengaluru, Chennai, Trivandrum, Varanasi, Lucknow, transport planning for Maha Kumbh Mela to be held in Allahabad in 2019, Indore, Bhopal, Amritsar, Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Chandigarh and Kolkata.
The highlight of the Hyderabad Conference is two special sessions for mayors and municipal councilors from the States of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala on Inclusive and sustainable mobility and intelligent mobility.
Inclusive Urban Transport Planning seeks to ensure the right of access to public spaces and particularly, to public transport systems for all. In the present scenario, road spaces in Indian cities are being used more by the vehicle owning sections at the cost of the poor and the marginalized. Similarly, sustainable Urban Transport and Mobility aims at integrating environmental concerns with transport planning so that urban residents are not deprived of quality air.
 UMI Conferences are being organized to further the objectives of the National Urban Transport Policy which lays stress on ‘moving the people rather than the cars’.
Hyderabad Conference will deliberate on various components of the chain of urban transport from conceptualization of urban transport projects, design, financing and execution.
The broad themes to be discussed include; Mobility for All, Multi-modal Integration, Inclusive Planning, New Paradigms of Mobility, Smart Cities and Mobility, Electric Mobility, Shared Mobility, Linking Urban Transport and Environment, Informal Transport Systems, Using Urban Transport Planning as an Opportunity, Efficient and Sustainable City Bus Service Systems, Financial Planning for Urban Transport Projects, Land Value Capture and Transit Oriented Development, Metro Rail Policy etc.

Volvo Cars, the premium car maker, aims for fully electric cars to make up 50 per cent of its sales by 2025, the company announced today.
The announcement builds on Volvo Cars’ 2017 industry-first announcement that all new models released from 2019 will be available as either a mild hybrid, plug-in hybrid or battery electric vehicle.
The company’s strategy to generate half of its sales from electric cars by 2025 positions it as a powerful player in China, the world’s leading market for electrified cars.
The Chinese government plans to have new-energy vehicles account for more than 20 per cent of the country’s annual car sales by 2025, which equates to more than seven million vehicles, based on Chinese government forecasts.
“Last year we made a commitment to electrification in preparation for an era beyond the internal combustion engine,” said Håkan Samuelsson, president and CEO of Volvo Cars. “Today we reinforce and expand that commitment in the world’s leading market for electrified cars.

China’s electric future is Volvo Cars’ electric future.”
Volvo Cars currently produces the S90 and S90L T8 Twin Engine in China.
This week marks the start of production for the XC60 T8 Twin Engine in China, meaning that soon all three Volvo Cars China plants – Luqiao, Chengdu and Daqing – will produce either plug-in hybrid or battery electric cars.
Today at the Beijing Auto Show, Volvo Cars will visually reinforce the company’s position as an industry leader in electrification with all cars on display plugged-in.
The event marks the first time the company displays only plug-in hybrid vehicles at an auto show.
In another first, side-by-side on stage, the company is displaying its three globally-available Volvo SUVs: the XC90, XC60 and the new XC40. Beijing also marks the first public appearance for the T5 plug-in hybrid version of the new XC40.
The new XC40 was recently crowned 2018 European Car of the Year and has already amassed more than 60,000 orders globally since its launch in late 2017, even though Volvo Cars is yet to open order books in China.
The early success of the XC40 supports Volvo Cars’ expectations of strong demand for its new small SUV in China.
These expectations are also underpinned by growth forecasts for the segment over the next five years, as well as a growing middle-class population and China GDP growth trends driven by domestic consumption.
China is Volvo Cars’ largest individual market and this year delivered a 23.3 per cent first quarter sales increase, contributing to the company’s first-quarter global sales growth of 14 per cent. Volvo car sales in China last year passed 100,000 units for the first time.
The local launch of the new XC40 and the company’s deepened commitment to electrification leave Volvo Cars well-positioned to deliver on its ambition to further boost its share of the world’s largest car market.

Didi Chuxing, a major ride-sharing company from China that provides transportation services for hundreds of millions of users, on Monday was used to illustrate what is the “sharing economy” during a UN event in Geneva.
“Didi is so well known in China. In 2017, Didi completed 7.4 billion rides. It has 450 million users in China and in only five years Didi has become a huge platform,” said Jianhua Li, Chief Development Officer of Didi Chuxing, at an event titled “Development Dimensions of the Sharing Economy — Learnings from China”.
“We started as a taxi-connecting platform. In China, you can make a reservation through the Didi app,” he said.
“Development Dimensions of Digital Platforms,” is the theme of the fourth E-Commerce Week organized by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) which started Monday.
It explores the growing role of digital platforms and concrete steps to harnessing these evolving technologies for sustainable development.
UNCTAD said that it has been estimated that the so-called “sharing economy” will surge from 14 billion US dollars in 2014 to 335 billion US dollars by 2025, and the interest in its implications for development is also surging.
“Most services relating to the’sharing economy’ use digital platforms to achieve a more efficient utilization (‘sharing’) of physical assets (e.g. house, car, physical space, machinery, clothes) or time,” says UNCTAD in a statement.
It can be applied to cooking, cleaning, or running errands, as well as knowledge and know-how.
Often, sharing economy activities involve an exchange of money as well as the creation of some employment.
“At Didi, we don’t have cars, we connect people,” said Li, noting that development is key to the company.
“We have about 10,000 employed in the company who are engineers,” said Li. “We think what we are doing is consistent with the goals of the United Nations and with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).”
“Some people are surprised that this platform has provided 21 million jobs opportunities,” said Li. “We pay people weekly… so we can help reduce poverty and have a positive impact on the general economic environment.”
The sharing economy can meet “people’s increasing demand for a better life” as well as the requirement for “a coordinated development among economy, society and nature,” and thus can become a key force in China’s economic growth and social development, according to an official from China Cyberspace Administration at the event.

Following in the tire tracks of other automakers, Nissan Motor Co. will introduce a car-sharing service, which allow registered members to rent and share vehicles, in January.
Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. have also put the pedal to the metal and entered the car-sharing business.
Nissan on Dec. 8 began accepting membership registrations on the website of its service, which the company has named “e-share mobi” (https://e-sharemobi.com).
For the time being, the company will keep one vehicle–either of its Leaf electric model or a gas-electric hybrid variant of its Note compact model–at each of its 30 or so stations to be located in nine prefectures, including Tokyo and Osaka.
A driver’s license card with an embedded IC chip will be used to unlock a car, whose rental fees start at 200 yen ($1.77) for 15 minutes.
Car-sharing services are catching on with customers for their convenience of use, which does not require a formal storefront.
The Times Car Plus service, operated by market leader Park24 Co., had 20,000 cars available at 10,000 stations across Japan as of the end of October 2017.
Compared with five years earlier, the number of stations had grown threefold, the number of vehicles had quadrupled, and the number of memberships had increased six times.

Honda began test-operating a car-sharing service in Tokyo in November 2013. It keeps a total of 140 or so vehicles at 90 or so stations and has 11,000 registered members.
Toyota has acquired a stake in a U.S. business venture that operates a peer-to-peer car-sharing service, with which the automaker is test-operating a car-sharing system.
Both Nissan and Honda are offering their “pick-of-the-bunch” models in their car-sharing operations. They are hoping that use by a broad customer base will lead to stronger subsequent sales of its automobiles.
For those worried about making an impression by showing up in a rental: Park24 on Dec. 8 released survey results showing that 52 percent of 20-somethings said there is “no problem” in going on a date in a rented or shared car.

Car sharing is catching on in the country, especially among millennials, many of whom cannot afford to own a car because of the rising cost of living or who are too environmentally conscious to do so.
Car sharing is a relatively recent phenomenon in Malaysia. It is the next version of the car rental service, one that can be accessed through an app on a smartphone. The cars — be they new or peer-to-peer — can be hired for a few hours, a day or several days.
Enterprise spoke to four car-sharing app founders and CEOs to get a feel of the local market and some of the challenges they face in bringing this service to this market.
Moovby was the first such app to be introduced in the country. The peer-to-peer service came about when co-founder and chief technology officer Nik Muhammad Amin let a junior at university use his car to attend a convocation and got paid for it. “It was a lightbulb moment for me,” he says.
Nik started doing research on the car-sharing industry, trying to figure out if it was time to bring it to our shores. He decided to attend a Malaysian Global Innovation & Creative Centre (MaGIC) road tour to look at the possibility of setting up a business and it was here that he met Nadzri Sazali, co-founder of the company. “We attended MaGIC’s programme in Sabah and we invited another friend, who was good at product design, to help out,” he says.
After four months of being incubated by MaGIC, the trio received a RM150,000 grant from the Cradle Investment Programme (under CIP50), which enabled them to develop Moovby. The Cradle Investment Programme provides financial assistance to entrepreneurs to help them start technology-based ventures.

Kwikcar co-founder and CEO Jared Chan, on the other hand, was inspired to start his peer-to-peer car-sharing service on one of his visits back to Malaysia. He was living in Australia and when he came back for the holidays, he found readily available and appropriately priced rental cars difficult to come by.
So, he started Kwikcar for others like him who thought rental cars in the country were too overpriced. He believes he can achieve affordable rentals through this peer-to-peer car-sharing service. Having done his research, he knows that there are plenty of cars sitting idly in garages or parking lots that are ideal for such a service.
“Malaysia has the third highest ratio of cars per household in the world. Some 93% of all households in the country own a car and there are about 11 million passenger vehicles that are stationary for more than 20 hours a day,” Chan points out.
GoCar’s founding story is similar to that of Kwikcar. Founder TJ Tan was inspired to start the service when he came back for a vacation (also from Australia). He found the process of renting a car in
Malaysia unnecessarily tedious.
GoCar CEO Alan Cheah says its service offers a lot less hassle as those who want to rent a car can do so via its app. Tan started worked on the app in March 2015 and launched it in February the following year.
The new kid on the block, as far as car-sharing apps in the country go, is Socar. This app took off in South Korea and the company is hoping to replicate its success in Malaysia.
Most of these apps are only available in the Klang Valley, with the exception of  GoCar, whose services are also available in Langkawi. However, the concept is slowly catching on in the rest of the country. Drivers from Penang, Johor, Sabah and Sarawak are already trying to register themselves or their cars on these apps.
Socar is providing a test run of its “door-to-door” service (meaning that it delivers the car to your doorstep) in the Bangsar area for a flat fee of RM5. “You can choose where you want to pick up the car in Bangsar within certain hours and you drop off the car anywhere in Bangsar, also within certain hours,” says Socar Malaysia CEO Leon Foong.
Socar and GoCar provide brand-new car fleets for their car-sharing services. Socar charges RM8 per hour for its cheapest model, a Perodua Axia, while GoCar charges RM14.90 per hour for its cheapest model, the Nissan Almera.
GoCar’s fleet is supplied by the Mayflower car rental business. Cheah points out that GoCar’s fleet of cars belongs to the company as it finds the peer-to-peer model rather messy, with a lot of legal and insurance issues. “We are not heading into that until the issues are resolved. Right now, we have more than 180 cars. But we are adding cars every month. In fact, we are adding almost 50 cars a month,” he says.
“We have a huge variety of cars, from the Nissan Almera to seven-seaters for families and four-wheel drives. These are the most popular cars among the community. Our cars are either Nissans or Renaults.”
As for the peer-to-peer car-sharing services, prices vary depending on the car make. There is a large variety of cars provided, from regular sedans to sports cars with up to 700 horsepower.
However, there are special rules for those who want to rent the more expensive cars, imposed by the service providers or the car owners themselves.
Helping millennials
Car sharing may be the best thing for millennials who want the freedom of driving without the burden of a car loan. But for those who choose to own their own car, such services could also help them with the loan.
“By renting out their cars every weekend, they can pretty much cover their car loans. That is really good because 25% of all millennial bankruptcy is due to unpaid car loans,” says Kwikcar’s Chan.
For instance, if someone lists his Perodua Myvi on Moovby, it will earn him about RM104 a day. If he rents it out four weekends a month, he could earn enough to pay for his loan, with a little left over as well.
But car sharing does not only earn those willing to participate extra pocket money. It is also good for the environment. A study conducted among 363 car-sharing respondents in the Netherlands, “Mobility and environmental impacts of car sharing in the Netherlands”, found 30% less car ownership among car sharers who also admitted that they drive 15% to 20% less than they did prior to car sharing.
According to the study, the shared cars mostly replace a second or third car. With reduced car ownership and car use, car sharers emit between 240 and 390 fewer kilogrammes of carbon dioxide per person, per year. This is between 13% and 18% of the carbon dioxide emissions related to car ownership and car use.
 
Insurance policies and safety
Moovby’s Nik admits that he had a hard time finding an insurance service provider that was on the ball or which kept up with the latest trends to insure cars and drivers. He went round to most of the insurance companies in Malaysia and was usually turned away with the usual reply: “I’m sorry, we do not provide such policies.”
He did not despair, however, and finally met the right insurance service provider. Allianz has been keeping up with most of the start-up trends and was the first insurer willing to come to the table and talk business.

Michael Fong, head of digital partnerships and innovation at Allianz, says the insurance coverage it currently provides car-sharing services in Malaysia is for personal accident and roadside assistance. He adds that since the company was already looking at ride sharing, addressing the needs of car-sharing providers was a natural progression.
“Because this is not vehicle attaching (which means the insurance is not attached to a specific vehicle but to the person driving the vehicle), it does not contravene any regulatory restrictions. So, it is allowable to provide personal accident coverage for the driver as well as roadside assistance. I think this is really to take away some of the risks and challenges these platforms share,” says Fong
In Australia, for example, you can buy additional cover for your private car for ride and car sharing. “This allows you to do Uber and Grab and also put your vehicles on car-sharing platforms such as Kwikcar or Moovby,” says Fong.
He adds that Allianz goes the extra mile to ensure that the solutions provided are compliant with the provisions of regulators such as Bank Negara Malaysia and the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD).
“So, both regionally and locally, we are supportive of new economy start-up platforms because we are passionate about local entrepreneurs and start-ups,” says Fong, adding that there is also an environmental dimension to this.
“In Europe, car and bike sharing has alleviated the number of vehicles on the road. People have really moved from ownership to users. They take public transport and use car sharing for the last mile.”
Other than insurance, car-sharing service providers have put their own safety measures in place. Socar and GoCar, for instance, have a keyless unlock button that connects you to the app and permits an individual to unlock a car and start it.
Foong says when it comes to the safety of the car, many features can be installed to prevent theft or vandalism. But this mostly depends on a community’s mentality. “We leverage our members’ understanding of the principles behind car sharing, which means taking care of the car, not just preventing car theft but keeping it in good condition.”
Moovby has developed its own smart Internet of Things kit. “This kit is actually an advanced telematics kit installed in all Moovby cars. It can automate the locking system, start and stop the engine and provide real-time GPS as well as behaviour-tracking,” says Nik.
As for Kwikcar, a similar telematics device is installed in the cars. The idea is that the device will not just allow the company to track the car but also furnish it with data on consumer behaviour (how the car is used and where they are travelling, in terms of distance and location).

Chan says this provides Kwikcar with important data on peak demand times for the cars. “It gives us aggregated and not individual data.”
With four car-sharing services already in Malaysia, one may be forgiven for thinking that the market is getting a little crowded. But GoCar’s Cheah does not think so. “If you are looking at the long game, there is plenty of room for improvement, provided that the players focus on improving our transport ecosystem, rather than just coming in for commercial purposes,” he says.
Chan does not believe that car sharing will become obsolete with the introduction of new technologies such as self-driving cars, but he does think the business model may need to be tweaked over the next 5 to 10 years to keep up with the changes.
After all, car sharing is on trend. Nik says according to research by Navigant Research, worldwide membership in car-sharing programmes will grow from 2.3 million in 2013 to more than 12 million by 2020 as this model of shared personal transport is seen as a potential solution to global gridlock.
Self-driving cars
Though autonomous cars have yet to make a big impact on the world market, everyone agrees that it is just a matter of time. Where will that leave the car-sharing business?
Socar’s Foong, for one, is excited about autonomous cars. “We look forward to partner leaders in that space to offer car-sharing members even greater benefits. We are amazed by the possibilities and believe that car-sharing platforms will be a natural partner with our data and understanding of travel and traffic patterns.”
Cheah agrees, saying that autonomous vehicles will remove the line between car and ride sharing. The legislation, however, will need to catch up. “We need to prepare for the upcoming changes in the transport landscape as the introduction of autonomous vehicles will require fundamental changes to infrastructure, policies and mindsets.”

Convenience has taken a whole new dimension in the transportation sector. With a smartphone, internet access, and a bank account (all of which you must have right now), you can have a driver take you anywhere you want from the exact point you are. Travis and Garrett’s troubles that snowy evening in Paris in 2008 made sure of that.
As long as you are in one of the 633 cities worldwide currently serviced by Uber, you have nothing to worry about. Whatever time of the day it is, it doesn’t matter, you are covered. You will be conveyed to your destination like the Boss that you are! In fact, you even choose what type of vehicle you want (SUV, sedan, luxury etc.). By the way, paying for the trip is as easy as it gets; no cash exchange or credit card swipes. It’s all automated and taken care of at the sign-up stage when you register your payment information along with other personal information. And, if you’re lucky to come across an occasional Uber promo code, you can also get a discount to an already dirt-cheap transportation service!
Uber, the San Francisco based company, started in 2009 and currently has over 7 million drivers and over 50 million riders; Elon Musk and Richard Branson are two of those. If it’s being a driver you are interested in, easy! You get to drive when you want and make what you need. The testimony of 87% of Uber drivers is that they drive on the Uber platform mainly because it allows them “be their own boss and set their own schedule”.
Uber operates in more than 75 countries and is valued more than 21st Century Fox, Ford, Time Warner, PayPal, and even General Motors.
Embrace the convenience!

The world was facing the Second Great War. Weapons that could never be imagined were being used to demolish towns, homes and infrastructure. To be able to navigate these broken roads and towns, the scooter was invented. Down the decades, the body and structure of the scooter may have evolved, but surprisingly little has been done to change the way it functions.
Keeping this in mind, Mihnea de Vries, a California-based serial entrepreneur with over 20 years of experience in different areas of tech, marketing and filmmaking, in 2016 decided to build Scooterson, a smart electric scooter

Rolley Scooterson is an intelligent electric kick-scooter with no gear shifter and no acceleration lever. The 20-kg scooter, made from aerospace grade materials, uses a unique combination of cloud and smartphone technology alongside big data analysis for a safe and efficient ride.
The world’s first intelligent scooter understands how fast to go by analysing a rider’s body movements. What else can it do? It can look for parking spots and reach your destination from where you want to be picked. It can also be shared with friends and family with a mobile app.
In the long term, the Scooterson team wants to converge the three verticals of electric vehicles, self-driving and ride-sharing, to create the best user experience.
The Rolley project
Mihnea started the company along with his friend and ex-band mate, Flavius Balaj, as a side project. He happened to meet Deepansh Jain at a tech conference and roped him in as a co-founder.
Deepansh, who had founded Shifu, an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant app that was later acquired by Paytm, was exploring different avenues. During the course of their conversation, the duo began talking about the uses of AI and how it could help change the way people ride. They spoke about how AI could improve the energy efficiency of electric vehicles.
Rolley by Scooterson
“We wanted a really cool-looking electric scooter for ourselves. When the first prototype was ready and we start testing it on the streets, we realised how many people wanted it. So many people approached us with questions and we knew there was a demand,” Mihnea says.
Later, the founders realised that it might be seen as just another electric scooter and the company couldn’t scale enough to really make a difference in the way people move around in cities.
Deepansh says a question followed: “What will happen to two-wheeler vehicles if they remain dumb in the era of self-driving cars, shared mobility and AI?”
The founders understood that solving this quest would “change the way we move around in cities”.
The market in India and e-scooters
The trio had realised that there were a few problems with the existing system. The issue with e-scooters is that certain skills are needed to ride a two-wheeled vehicle and access to e-scooters is limited.
But India is slowly witnessing a positive trend in the electric vehicle market. According to a report by Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles, electronic vehicle sales in India grew 37.5 percent to 22,000 units in the year ended March 2016.
With sales of over 17.6 million scooters between 2016 and 2017 in India, it is no surprise that there are a growing number of electric two-wheeler manufacturing startups in India.
Rolley by Scooterson
Gujarat-based Yo Bykes  pioneered the electric scooter in India. Coimbatore-based EV startup Ampere Electric has developed electric cycles, electric two-wheelers and e-scooters. The company also claims to be the first to make their own chargers (36V and 48V) for e-vehicles.
Ather Energy claims that, unlike other players, its S340 offers a connected ride experience with features such as onboard navigation, personalised profiles, a top speed of 72 kmph and sub-one-hour charging.
Other players in the space include Hero RNT Diesel Hybrid Scooter, Hero Splendor iSmart, Hero Leap, Mahindra GenZe, TVS Qube and Hyosung ST-E3 EVA.
 
How does it work?
With the need to focus on a lease-like model, the team at Scooterson decided to come up with an additional subscription-based ownership option for a two-wheeled vehicle. The team knew that electricity would be economical as the cost to ride 100 km is just 19 cents globally or Rs 5 in India.
With Scooterson, a rider rides as he or she would ride any regular kick-scooter – but there aren’t any acceleration levers or gear changers.
Deepansh Jain
“So you just sit and move,” Deepansh says.
The Scooterson App will automatically start Rolley when you are within activation range. Using its knowledge of your daily habits it can predict and suggest your most likely destination. The Predictive Routing becomes increasingly accurate and is used by other smart features to increase energy efficiency and safety, based on riding patterns, rider profile and surrounding terrain.
The app also adapts power and torque settings to perfectly match with remaining battery levels.
“So you are able to ride at peak performance without draining batteries before arriving at your destination. The flipside is that when the battery is low, the app will drop the settings to an energy conservation mode that will allow you to arrive at your destination before the battery dies,” Deepansh adds.
The vehicle follows a truly predictive model; the more one rides, the more information the app gathers and stores on the cloud. After a while, by leveraging this data, it will create a new optimised powertrain profile that is based on your riding patterns, weight and surrounding terrain specifics. You can have multiple powertrain profiles, optimised for better performance or for more range.
Connecting friends and family
Scooterson connects to smartphones and smartwatches to display speed, battery status, ride statistics and other traffic-relevant data acquired from the cloud. The app continuously tracks the status of your scooter and connects to the cloud to receive rider’s optimised and personalised torque and power settings, as well as software updates.
Using the app, your friends and colleagues can request access to use the scooter. The cloud-based sharing management system will send you a notification to grant them access. The app will unlock your scooter, pair it with your friend’s smartphone and allow the use of all predefined features accessible to a guest user. The system will also notify your friend about the time they can use the vehicle for, and will remind them when time’s nearly up.
“You don’t need to worry about the safety of your scooter. Your smartphone or watch acts as a key when the device is located within the predefined auto lock-unlock range. The security mode will automatically activate when you move a short distance from the scooter,” Deepansh says.
The owner is also notified if the scooter is tampered with or moved from the last parked position. The built-in GPS signal can be tracked live on the owner’s mobile device if the vehicle is stolen.
Because Scooterson does not have a throttle, the rider has to push with his feet until a 3.5 mph (5km/h) speed threshold.  The motor assistance kicks in only over this speed. There is also a “low power assistance” mode and riders have to push with their feet from time to time, even beyond the speed threshold.
“Scooterson is the first company to offer a subscription-based ownership option for a two-wheeled vehicle, after a few major car automakers started the trend in 2017. The $99/month subscription comes with theft insurance and unlimited maintenance included. For sales, the promotional price is $1,990 for the first 1,000 units, after which the product is priced at $2,490,” Deepansh says.
The team claims to have had over pre-sales worth $2 million as of May this year. In the near future, the team aims to be a leader in the intelligent two-wheeler market.
A scooter that’s smart and connected – it’s sure to wire you up for a great ride in urban agglomerates as well as small towns.

Indiana State University is launching a new bike-share program that’s powered, in part, by the sun.
ISU purchased around 130 bicycles from the San Francisco-based company Spin. People can rent a bike for 50 cents every half hour by using a phone app.
Sustainability Coordinator Nick McCreary says what makes the ISU bike share different is the bikes don’t have to be returned to a charging station.
Instead, instead solar panels in the bikes’ baskets power the GPS.
“These can be parked and picked up anywhere because the lock is built into the back of it,” McCreary says.
“Basically all you do is you download the spin app and you put your information in and then you scan the back of the bike, it’ll unlock, then you ride.
And then you lock it when you’re done.”
McCreary says he wants to get more students active.
“Students might think a five minute walk is too far but a one minute bike ride isn’t, so hopefully it’ll spread students out and get them to drive less,” he says.
The bikes can only be used on campus. McCreary says they’re working with the city of Terre Haute to expand the program city wide.

For now, the ISU bikes can only be used on campus (Zach Herndon, WFIU/WTIU News)

Now through the end of May, cyclists in four different American cities can take advantage of free bike share, courtesy of Switzerland.
Yes, that Switzerland. The country’s tourism office partnered with Motivate—a company that oversees bike-share programs in eight cities across the US—to offer riders one full day of free access to systems in select metro areas. (Participating systems include Citi Bike in New York/Jersey City, Hubway in Boston, Divvy in Chicago, and Ford GoBike in the Bay Area.)
Anyone interested can send an e-postcard to a friend through Switzerland Tourism’s website. The giftee gets a free day of rides in one the four bike-share markets, while the gift-giver will be entered into a raffle for a bike trip to Switzerland, among other prizes.
Part of the country’s three-year Nature Wants You Back ad campaign, the promotion is meant to highlight Switzerland’s bike-friendly initiatives.
“Switzerland isn’t just about skiing and hiking in the Alps,” said Alex Hermann, Switzerland Tourism’s director for North America. “It offers 5,600 miles of cycling routes and 2,800 miles of mountain biking trails.”
It’s also no stranger to robust bike rentals: Fifteen different Swiss municipalities offer some 200 stations where riders can take out city bikes or e-bikes. In some cities, including Zurich, standard bikes can be borrowed for free.
According to Hermann, the goal of the giveaway is to reach younger people who might be interested in traveling for an active vacation.
“We believe that the core cycling market already knows how fantastic the cycling is in Switzerland,” he said. “We want to reach people who enjoy riding, but who may not necessarily consider themselves cyclists.”
The four cities were chosen because Swiss International Air Lines has a hub in each. (Motivate also operates in Portland, Oregon; Columbus, Ohio; and Washington, DC, but they’re not included in the promotion.) Swiss Tourism previously collaborated with Motivate on a similar, single-day bike share promotion in 2015.

Users can send free rides to as many friends as they want. Each recipient will get a code for one day of free bike share in a single city in May.
The deal differs slightly from place to place: Recipients can take multiple rides, with the times limits for each ranging from 30 minutes to three hours.
Swiss Tourism is also offering free rides in Montreal, where Bixi bike share ambassadors will hand out two-for-one postcards at high-traffic stations from May 4-7.
In all participating cities, lucky riders can also sample Swiss chocolate and cheese from custom Motivate tricycles and learn more about riding in Switzerland.

Singapore will be the first country in Asia to try out Finnish transportation app Whim – a service that shows users the best way to get from one point to another using public transport.
The app will be launched by 2018, the creators said on the first day of the Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology (SWITCH) on Monday (Sep 18).
The app aims to turn transport into a service on demand, the way Netflix has done for entertainment and Spotify for music. Different modes of transport, including buses, taxis and possibly even bicycles can be aggregated on the app.
Users can pay a monthly subscription fee that covers payments for all rides on any mode of transport, or they can pay as they go.
The company behind the app, Mobility-as-a-Service or MaaS Global, said the aim of the app is to turn cities into car-free zones.
“What we offer is a true alternative to car ownership because if every mode of transportation is readily and easily available to you, you don’t have to buy a car”, said MaaS Global’s co-founder Kaj Pyyhtia.



Singapore was deemed as a “the perfect place to enter the Asian market” because the country is seen to be a “tech and business hub … and its infrastructure is one of the most developed in the world”, according to Mr Pyyhtia.





The company also hopes that local companies will be transparent with their interface, payment systems and database in order to allow a smooth integration of the app.


“We want to be the best possible platform for all transportation providers. But that means we have to negotiate and work together with them, and integrate their services into our app,” Mr Pyyhtia added.
SHARING TECHNOLOGIES BETWEEN SINGAPORE AND FINLAND
The app is among many smart living solutions from the Finnish capital of Helsinki on showcase at a seminar held during the Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology.
Both the Finnish and Singaporean governments are making use of the seminar to share their innovations and technologies across various sectors.
Additionally, Singapore’s Transport Ministry and Land Transport Authority (LTA) hosted Finland’s Minister of Transport and Communications Ms Anne Berner to a live demonstration of LTA’s use of drones to inspect rail infrastructure at a completed portion of the new Thomson-East Coast Line, between Orchard and Orchard Boulevard stations.

INDEED, the world is heading to the future, where vehicles will be run by green energies and more in-sync with humans. That is why the 45th Tokyo Motor Show was all about going beyond motor vehicles by discovering new directions in order to redefine the very meaning of “automobile”. The convention showcased numerous concept cars, exhibiting future possibilities for the society and mobility.
The Riding Assist-e EV bike is the motorcycle of the future.
Honda Motor Co. Ltd., on the other hand, is committed to expanding human possibilities, as well as creating enriched lives through transportability. None other than the company president and CEO, Takahiro Hachigo, spearheaded the media presentation of Honda’s spectacle of more than 50 vehicles, which include various electric models, high-performance cars, motorsports and motorbikes. “Honda has strengths in producing a broad range of products, including motorcycles, automobiles, power products and even business jets. Such strengths as a manufacturer and relationship with our customers are proof that Honda has been embodying its passion to ‘serve people worldwide with joy of expanding their life’s potential,’” he said.
President and CEO Takahiro Hachigo (left) with Chief Officer for Regional Operations (Asia and Oceania) Shinji Aoyama
But the real crowd drawers were the three concept vehicles with one set to make its global debut plus an electric-vehicle (EV) bike on the stage. While Honda has been into developing hybrid and plug-in hybrid models with enduring passion to realize the joy of driving and helping people, this enthusiasm further transcended to the development of EV models. “Without compromising the merits of electrification, we will create products that will enhance convenience and fun for our customers,” Hachigo explained.
Unveiled during the presentation was the Sport EV Concept—developed to fathom the joy of driving. What immediately flaunted was the low and wide stance, along with indisputable touch of retro-design language—in a futuristic package, of course. But if you further dig into Honda’s history, you may find the profile somewhat derived from the 1960’s S600. Nevertheless, the rounded lines all throughout the frame characterizes a sports model expressing an impression of the near future. Center of gravity was further lowered in favor of a sportier feel. Interestingly, this next-generation sports car in compact frame combines EV performance and AI technology, which provide that feeling of emotional unity to the driver.
Hachigo with the Sports EV Concept
Also on the platform was the Urvan EV Concept, which first introduced in the recently concluded Frankfurt Motor Show, finally made its Japan debut. The model incorporates a newly developed EV-dedicated platform (shared with the Sports EV concept), representing the future direction of the design and technology of mass-produced electric vehicles. Its compact proportions, which is ideal for modern city driving, also denotes that retro, yet futuristic signature with rounded delineations. But the cabin layout is definitely a stunner, as it conveys the kind of soothing ambiance similar to a conducive living room.
Another concept vehicle on display was the Honda NeuV. Introduced for the first time in Japan, this EV commuter-concept model is equipped with AI and automated driving capabilities. Imagine a system that determines the driver’s stress level from facial expressions and voice tones to support safer driving. Further, it has the ability to acquire the driver’s lifestyle and preferences, which, in turn, recommend options depending on the circumstances. “We are planning to begin sales of a new model based on this Urban EV concept first in Europe, and then Japan in 2020,” Hachigo revealed. Last, the Riding Assist-e EV bike. This motorcycle of the future utilizes a proprietary balance-control technology—developed for humanoid robots. The machine keeps its balance at low speeds, reducing rider burdens, and makes riding easier.
The future of mass-produced vehicle Urvan EV Concept
Electrification toward 2030
THE following day was an exclusive meeting with Hachigo and by Chief Officer for Regional Operations (Asia and Oceania) Shinji Aoyama at the Honda headquarters in Tokyo. During the session, Hachigo shared the company’s target to achieve two-thirds sales of EV models globally by 2030—hybrid, plug-in hybrid, as well as battery/FC EV. But in order to achieve it, they have to look into several technical challenges, such as cruising speed and charging time, to name a few. Another is the cost to reduce in order to offer their products at an affordable price.
As for the infrastructure, Hachigo is confident that they can meet the daily EV requirements with their existing setup. “For 2030 we think that this will be mostly achieved with hybrid and plug-in hybrid, and we think that the current infrastructure is efficient. Another is the Hydrogen EV, we have to think about the charging-station requirement,” he explained. When it comes to Europe, China, Japan and North America, the company will have charging stations for Hydrogen EV.
However, the Asean region would have to settle first with hybrid models. Aoyama explained the reason and steps they’re taking. “I would prefer to concentrate on providing affordable cars to Asian customers—this is our first step.  Of course, it has to be more fuel-efficient and environment-friendly. Then, for the second stage, we will introduce, step by step, the plug-in hybrid then battery EV and more FC EV,” he said. Honda will continue to present its position for electrification to the respective governments of the targeted countries.

With gas prices on the rise around Metro Vancouver you may be one of the many people looking to get into a car share service.
While it’s hard to say whether their increase spike interest is a direct result of soaring fuel prices, one company says it is hearing from members about it.
“I can tell you anecdotally that we do get lots of member feedback around gas pricing, and those saying that they’re using Evo car share more because of the spikes in gas and the overall increases in vehicle ownership,” explains Tai Silvey, director of Evo.
He adds the company has seen a steady rate of sign-ups since it became available a few years ago, and the number of vehicles in their fleet has also increased significantly.
Gas prices were pushed even higher this month after a hike to BC’s carbon tax. This comes after fuel prices hit an all-time high in Metro Vancouver this past March.
The pain at the pumps has forced many to look at alternatives when it comes to transportation. Depending on how you look at it, that could include car shares.

“This might be part of the high cost of living in Vancouver, including gas prices, but Vancouver is really the car sharing capital of North America,” Silvey tells NEWS 1130. “There are more cars per 100,000 people here than anywhere else in North America and the overall market continues to grow. So, as costs get more expensive here, the addition of Evo in this market has just… vastly expanded the number of people who use car sharing, and we continue to see that month over month.”
He adds jumps aren’t just seen in memberships, but also in usage.
Evo offers a pay-by-minute system and all vehicles are hybrids. That, Silvey says, means they don’t have to look at raising fees to correspond with higher gas prices. “We consume far less fuel than your average compact vehicle, so it has a much less of an impact on our overall operations. So no, we have no intention of increasing our costs due to increasing fuel costs.”
On Apr. 1, the BC NDP increased the carbon tax by $5/t, right before the summer driving season when prices go up anyway. There will be an increase of 1.2 cents a litre annually for the next four years.
The goal of the levy is to have BC achieve its 2050 emissions reduction target (80 per cent below 2007 levels by 2050.)

A ridesharing platform specifically for older adults has hired a senior living veteran to help it grow.
Scottsdale, Arizona-based Envoy America on Tuesday announced it has named Tiffany Wright as its new director of business development.
In her new role, Wright will be tasked with growing the company’s market share in the senior living, health care and religious institutions market segments.
Wright has approximately 25 years of experience in marketing and business development, many of which were spent in the senior care space.
For instance, Wright has worked as a community sales manager for Louisville, Kentucky-based senior housing provider Atria Senior Living; as president of Senior Lifestyle Connections, a senior referral service; as owner of Morningstar Assisted Living, an assisted living and memory care community in Atlanta, Georgia; and as an outreach manager/skilled admission director at Chicago-based senior housing provider Vi.
Most recently, according to her LinkedIn profile, Wright worked as the director of business development at a Rapid Recovery Center operated by Mainstreet Health in the Phoenix, Arizona, area.
In March, Carmel, Indiana-based Mainstreet Health announced it had decided to pull all of its Rapid Recovery Centers of the Arizona market, laying off 70 workers.

Envoy America operates a mobile application and ridesharing platform that matches seniors in certain Arizona markets with drivers.
These drivers can take seniors to and from a number of places, including medical appointments, religious services, outings with friends and shopping malls.
Envoy America’s services differ from those offered by popular ridesharing platforms Uber and Lyft in that Envoy drivers continue to accompany their passengers after they arrive at their destinations.
This may include helping the passengers identify the correct suite at the doctor’s office or pushing the passenters’ carts at the grocery store, according to the company’s website.
Additionally, seniors who wish to use Envoy’s services can call ahead of time to set up their rides or reserve a ride online.
Many senior housing providers, including Brentwood, Tennessee-based Brookdale Senior Living (NYSE: BKD) have embraced Lyft as a worthwhile transportation option for residents.
In June 2017, the nation’s largest senior housing provider announced it would be scaling up a pilot with Lyft, ultimately offering Lyft services at 25 communities nationwide.

The dawn of the ‘roboconomy’ is almost upon us, as car manufacturers increasingly turn their collective focus to self-driving, connected and electric cars, according to new research from PricewaterhouseCoopers’ global consulting arm Strategy&.
With the research anticipating that the first “robot cars” will take to the roads in various regions from 2023, how we travel could be in for a shake up in the near future.
Releasing its Digital Auto Report 2017, Strategy& notes “the future belongs to ‘shared mobility’”. The roboconomy, based on connected and self-driving cars, will comprise mobility offerings and associated car-related digital services.
While 85% of all new cars are already classed as connected, Richard Viereckl, Strategy& managing director and co-author of the study, said “electric and self-driving vehicles are only a few years away from definitive breakthrough”.
“It is particularly in the area of opportunity combining ‘connected’ and ‘self-driving’ that a huge new business segment is set to evolve in the years ahead for the entire automotive sector, in the form of digital mobility services,” Viereckl commented.
Meanwhile, the transition to “mobility-as-a-service” in the medium term is set to have an impact on both the automotive sector and customer behaviour, as pressure increases on margins in the conventional car production segment.
By 2030, Strategy& anticipates that 36% of all mileage driven in Europe will be in shared-use vehicles and 42% in self-driving vehicles.

Between 2017 and 2030, Strategy& forecasts that the market volume in shared mobility will rise annually by 24% in Europe, the US and China to €1.3 billion ($1.9 billion). Additionally, it predicts around 33% of all new vehicles will be used for shared mobility by 2030.
“The transition to shared or self-driving fleets means a massive upheaval for the automotive sector,” said Alex Koster, Strategy& managing director and study co-author.
“In future, vehicles will be used far more intensively than is the case for private cars today.
“Given the rapid depreciation, business segments such as the used-car trade will become less relevant, and the manufacturers will also be increasingly engaged in regular servicing work on fleet vehicles.”
Koster noted that competition will shift moving forward with fleet management, regionally different transport regulations and infrastructure seeing mobility become a local business.

The embattled on-demand taxi service firm Uber has announced that it has acquired the electric bike-sharing service startup JUMP Bikes, marking the company’s further investment into the on-demand mobility services sector.
The exact financial terms of the deal have yet to be revealed publicly, but the purchase agreement was reportedly only entered into recently.
Why does this matter? It’s notable due to the fact that Uber’s goal of being at the forefront of the robo-taxi sector is looking less and less likely to be achieved, with Waymo/Google and Cruise/GM both looking very looking to be the actual pioneers in the sector, and with Uber’s competitor Lyft being the beneficiary due to its close relationship with both.
The much publicized pedestrian fatality caused by an Uber self-driving test vehicle in Arizonarecently (possibly as the result of company negligence) adds a negative-PR dimension to its technological problems, making it seem unlikely that the firm will manage to field its own commercial self-driving taxis anytime soon.
With all of that in mind, diversification (as represented by this minor acquisition) makes some sense. Perhaps expect to see more of the same from the company over the coming months and years.
Reuters provides more: “Uber said in a statement it had entered an agreement to buy JUMP, but an Uber spokeswoman declined to disclose the terms of the deal. JUMP is a dockless electric bike service that has rolled out in San Francisco, where it has a small presence with 250 bikes, and Washington, DC. About 100 JUMP employees will join Uber, the spokeswoman said.”
“Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the acquisition furthers Uber’s goal of offering ‘the fastest or most affordable way to get where you’re going, whether that’s in an Uber, on a bike, on the subway, or more’.”

As controversy continues around dockless bikes and other vehicles cluttering sidewalks in San Diego, scooter operator Bird is floating a code of conduct it hopes rivals will adopt to ease tensions over the emerging technology.
Bird CEO Travis VanderZanden wrote an open letter to his counterparts at four bike sharing companies urging them to join him to “Save Our Sidewalks” by signing on to a three-pronged pledge that he says would help American cities avoid the plight of “out-of-control” bike sharing deployment in China. Huge piles of abandoned and broken bikes overrun the sidewalks in that country, he said.
The plan unveiled Tuesday calls for repositioning bikes and scooters based on rider demand, limiting the number deployed to city streets and donating $1 per vehicle per day to cities in which the companies operate.
Bird’s proposal came the same day KPBS broke the news that the Little Italy Association has been using its maintenance crews to remove shared bikes from that neighborhood’s center and line them up on a sidewalk adjacent to Interstate 5. The association’s side-by-side placement of the bikes has at times blocked portions of the sidewalk.
Ofo, one of the main dockless bike-sharing companies in San Diego, said it would not join the pledge and derided Bird’s proposal as motivated by self-interest. Ofo spokesman Taylor Bennett said Ofo is “actively” working with the Little Italy group to address its concerns.
“We encourage Bird to join us in working together with local governments before launch and support cities’ desire to have a framework for safety in place before new products are released to the public,” Bennett said.
Both companies have a track record of entering markets without official permission. The city of Santa Monica in December filed a criminal complaint against Bird, accusing it of operating without a license and refusing to comply with city citations, including orders to remove scooters from sidewalks.

 
Bird pleaded no contest and agreed to pay more than $300,000 in fines and secure a proper business license. The company’s agreement with that city also required it to run a public safety campaign on public buses, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Ofo similarly dropped a fleet of its own yellow bikes on the UCSD campus last year without asking university officials for permission. The university kicked the bike sharing company off campus and has since signed a partnership with rival bike sharing company Spin.
In San Diego, the main bike or scooter sharing companies operating in the city — LimeBike, Ofo, Mobike and Bird — hold the required business tax certificate, according to the mayor’s office.
A Bird representative said the company “wants to work with cities on our shared goal of reducing traffic and carbon emissions. That is why we continually engage with the cities, campuses and communities in which we operate, and make sure that we are following all the rules of the road — just like any other business.”
A spokesman for the San Diego mayor’s office said the city has sent letters to each operator to ensure they’re aware of the state and city laws that pertain to their businesses, including laws governing bikes, scooters, property and business activity in the public right-of-way and activity in public parks and beaches.
“We appreciate the proactive approach the dockless bike-sharing companies are taking to address concerns raised by residents and businesses,” said Greg Block, a spokesman for Mayor Kevin Faulconer.
Dockless bikes proliferated in San Diego after the city attorney in January cleared the companies to operate in the city.
The City Council has not considered any new rules regulating the businesses, though existing laws prohibit parking bikes or scooters in a way that blocks pedestrian or vehicle traffic.
In his Tuesday letter, Bird’s CEO said the company would pick up all of its scooters from city streets every night to inspect and repair vehicles as necessary and reposition the scooters “to where the vehicles are wanted the next day, so they are not cluttering our neighborhoods.”
The company also pledged that it will not increase the number of vehicles in any city unless they are being used on average at least three times per day and will remove any underutilized scooters.
Additionally, VanderZanden offered to provide city governments $1 per scooter per day “so they can use this money to build more bike lanes, promote safe riding, and maintain our shared infrastructure.”
A spokeswoman for the City Attorney’s Office said that proposed arrangement appears to be a donation to the city, which must be made in accordance with the City Council’s donation policy and reviewed by the city’s lawyers.
The policy stipulates that donations must be used for city business, though donations can be restricted for certain purposes by the donor.
VanderZanden urged his counterparts at LimeBike, Ofo, Mobike and Jump to sign onto the pledge, but so far none have done so, according to Bird.

Elon Musk likes to start at the top and work down. In Sweden, when it comes to EV incentives, the government is starting at the bottom and working its way up. According to Norwegian news source Elbil, it is now offering a rebate equal to 25% of the purchase price of an electric bicycle, tricycle, or quadricycle.
The Swedish rebate program will not apply to self-balancing devices like Segways or hoverboards, but the article in Elbil suggests the Renault Twizy may be eligible. In some cases, an electric wheelchair or hand-operated bicycle may qualify for the incentive. The total amount of money available is limited to 350 million krona annually — about $12 million.

Any Swedish citizen who purchased a qualifying vehicle after September 20, 2017, is eligible. Payments are managed by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and will begin after February 1 of next year.
Unlike some countries where greed is a national pastime, Swedish authorities will monitor the market to make certain manufacturers don’t automatically mark up the price of their products to include the amount of the rebate. “Job-killing regulation” and “nanny-state socialism” at work, folks.
 Sales of electric bicycles and similar vehicles are exploding in Scandinavia. Last year, about 67,000 electric bicycles were sold in Sweden and another 36,000 were sold in Norway.

“Research shows that electric bikes replace cars,” says Karolina Skog, Sweden’s Minister of Environment. “Now there is a good selection of bicycles in place and the market has begun to evolve.”

She believes there will be more investment in infrastructure when more people begin using electric bicycles. Norway has already committed $1 billion to building new bike paths so people can commute to and from work safely and conveniently.
A recent survey of Norwegian bicycle riders conducted by the Electric Vehicle Association finds that price is the main sticking point for people considering the purchase of an electric bicycle. Also important is more secure parking for bicycles in cities, where stolen bikes are a major problem.

PORTSMOUTH, Va. (WAVY) — Transportation — or lack thereof — was a big issue during and after last week’s snow storm.
The storm left behind a mess on the roads, dropping between 5 and 10 inches of snowfall in certain areas.
This led to many neighborhoods being snowed-in and services like Hampton Roads Transit to cancelling operations.
Ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft played a big role in making it possible for some to get around the region.

10 On Your Side’s Joe Fisher rode around with Uber driver Patricia Nicholson, who put in more than 50 hours on the roads following the storm.
Nicholson says she’s made good money, but also adds it’s about more than that.
In one trip, she took a child with respiratory problems to Children’s Hospital of the King’s Daughters (CHKD).
She says it was important to make sure people got to their destination safely.
“After taking that woman to the hospital and realizing that law enforcement can’t get to some people in the time that they would like to, I just feel like military, people at the hospital, anyone that needs, they have to get to where they need to go.”
Nicholson says surge pricing helped earn more than $1,000 since the storm.

Shared Mobility and electric cars, according to Daimler.
Dieter Zetsche has been at the heart of the global auto industry for last many decades, but the chairman of 153-billion-euro Daimler, that makes Mercedes, feels the current churn in the industry – led by new concepts such as shared mobility to autonomous driving and electric vehicles -to be one of his most-challenging periods. “I have never seen a time of so much change and India will play a key role in development of new technologies,” 64-year-old Zetsche tells TOI in an interview.Excerpts:
Concepts like shared mobility, electric cars, autonomous cars are fast picking up. How do you view the general trend in the automobile industry?

New technologies give global opportunities. Digitalisation is key, and we have identified four new trends as CASE -connectivity , autonomous driving, sharing and electric vehicles. We try to pioneer the future on these trends.
Tell us about Mercedes Benz Research & Development India and what role does it play for you globally?

When it comes to digitalisation, India is second to none. We have been here for last 21 years, and are now in a perfect situation to leverage new opportunities. This is the largest R&D centre for us outside Germany. We have projects in development of electric vehicles and respective control units which are almost autonomously done here for trucks, vans and buses.
When it comes to machine learning and deep learning, we have a very strong competence here which might become the centre of competence for the group altogether .We are using these skills for autonomous driving, which is another area with strong involvement of tech centre  in India. Even for user interface in the car, we are working together with our activities in the Silicon Valley.

Global trends are pointing towards autonomous and electric cars, and shared mobility. Is it scary when some say headquarters of the auto industry have shifted to Silicon Valley and is dominated by companies such as Facebook, Google, andTesla? Is personal mobility under threat?

I am not scared at all. I have a lot of respect for the potential new competitors. These are companies, especially the established tech companies, which have proven their capabilities and power. There is no doubt about this.
On the other hand, we are changing very fast. We are having the strongest period in our company’s history. We are able to invest huge amount of money in R&D and capex. To develop future business, we are open for cooperation and collaborations.
We are cooperating with startups as well.
 What is the future of personal mobility. A decade or five years from now, will people buy new cars or use apps to access shared mobility. Is this challenging for the luxury industry?

I believe there will be no either or. We will see many more different forms of mobility than we saw in the past. The customer will have more possibilities and the sharing platform will play an important role. I am convinced that people will continue to purchase -especially in autonomous driving where they get more time to do other things than  just conducting and manoeuvring the car. Then it might be more useful for them to see how seamlessly they can communicate within the car, how well they can refresh and relax in the car, or get entertained.
 So, personal mobility will not be impacted by shared ecosystem?

I don’t think individual mobility will come down. I see further growth in mobility altogether.So, there is plenty of opportunity. Our task is to eliminate emissions and accidents. We have to work towards emission and accident-free driving. Of course, sharing is also critical.
How do you see Tesla as a competitor?


 I respect what Elon Musk is doing and his approach. He went to the other end, to luxury, and made electric car driving more desirable. At the same time, we have sold electric cars 12 years ago, long before him, but did not come up with a really-convincing car.

We now have an entire fleet of very-competitive electric cars under development and I have no doubt that we will be as attractive to buyers of electric cars in the future.



Is India, companies have been given stiff target of 2030, whereas UK has given 2040. Do you think you have been forced to going for electric? Is it too early?

Governments should give us ambitious but realistic targets to bring down CO2. From today’s perspective, it is most likely to be battery-electric vehicles, but it is not the final judgement.
I think it’s a much better approach that we try to make the most exciting electric cars that customers can’t resist to buy . That is the way to get there in a market-driven economy .We expect that by 2025, around 15-20% of our production will be of battery electric vehicles.
 Do you think that there’s no future for diesel?


Technologically it’s possible to have modern diesel engines which are as clean as modern gasoline engines… It would not be smart for the society in general and particularly for the auto companies to forego the potential of diesel engines.

We do believe that diesel is one element of our future even while we invest heavily in electric vehicles.

The surprise announcement of a collaboration between Mahindra & Mahindra and Ford Motor Company could signal not only growing ambitions of the Indian company in overseas markets but also an abrupt U-turn by Ford on its India plans. M&M and Ford have agreed to explore a strategic alliance, designed to leverage the benefits of Ford’s global reach and expertise and Mahindra’s scale in India and successful operating model. Remember, the two companies were partners earlier before parting ways. So this would be a second coming.
In a statement, the two potential partners have said “The agreement between the two companies will allow each to leverage their mutual strengths during a period of unprecedented transformation in the global automotive industry. The areas of potential cooperation include: Mobility programs, Connected vehicle projects, Electrification, Product development, Sourcing and commercial efficiencies, Distribution within India, improving Ford’s reach within India and improving Mahindra’s reach outside India.”


Reuters

Ford’s renewed optimism on India is welcome. Remember, compatriot General Motors stopped selling vehicles here last year, after years of struggling in one of the world’s fastest growing markets, unable to compete with Goliaths. Market leader Maruti Suzuki India sells almost every second car in the domestic market; Maruti, Hyundai Motor India and Tata Motors together control over two-thirds of the market, leaving slim pickings for all other car makers. For Ford to survive in this market, a partnership with a homegrown player would perhaps be the best course of action.
Just like GM, Ford too had put India business on watch under its previous leadership but when the current CEO Jim Hackett took over earlier this year, he started with a 100-day review of Ford’s business in its entirety. So the rethink on India’s utility in Ford’s global scheme of things probably forms a large part of this 100-day gameplan and the push may well be to make Ford relevant again in the Indian market.
Why Ford needs to slog in India is quite obvious. Its market share after decades of presence is still well short of even the 5 percent mark, the last product to set the markets on fire was the Figo and now, with the global push towards vehicles which will eschew fossil fuels, Ford (like other auto makers) needs to reorient its strategy from scratch.
Mahindra & Mahindra has not only steadily expanded its passenger vehicle business, the company is also a pioneer of sorts in developing and testing vehicles which operate on alternate fuel technologies.
Almost a decade earlier, M&M was perhaps the first company in India to indigenously develop hybrid models for its best seller Scorpio.
This, when other auto makers in India were still pooh-poohing any need for vehicles based on alternate fuels/technologies. This just goes to show why M&M may have the required expertise to not just offer alternate mobility solutions to Ford, but also those which are indigenous and therefore cost effective and suited to Indian conditions.
Almost all solutions for mobility – electric, hybrids (electric plus battery) – are quite expensive for commercial use even now. In other markets where these technologies have been actually put to commercial use, respective governments have had to offer subsidies to encourage these. With such a partnership, cost-effective alternate fuel technologies may well get developed.
As per the statement the two potential partners, “The spirit of ingenuity has driven Mahindra to be amongst the few global companies pioneering the development of clean and affordable technology, and is the only player with a portfolio of electric vehicles commercially available in India.

Expanding its global presence, Mahindra owns majority stake in Ssangyong Motor Company in Korea, has forayed into the shared mobility space with investments in ride sharing platforms in the USA, and is developing products like the GenZe – the world’s first electric connected scooter.”
The recent outburst by Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari about forcing all vehicle makers switch to electric in the next three years – never mind technological and cost challenges – in India should also be seen as a mild trigger for more such partnerships for automakers to survive in a rapidly changing world. Besides, Mahindra needs to piggyback on Ford’s distribution and reach to expand its global footprint. So, on paper at least, any such potential partnership looks good.
It is not a done deal though. The agreement merely states that teams from both companies will meet and discuss regularly for three years on any collaboration and an agreement will emerge only after this.
This article in The Hindu reminds us that M&M and Ford are revisiting a partnership, after breaking off an earlier alliance. Ford India Private Ltd was before March 1998 known as Mahindra Ford India Ltd. It entered India through a joint venture with M&M in which Ford held a 49 percent stake and M&M 51 percent.
Ford gradually increased its stake in the venture to close to 85 percent and took over operational control from M&M. After M&M entered into a 51:49 equity partnership with French car-maker Renault, Mahindras and Ford had agreed to formally dissolve their relationship by selling their cross-holdings in each other. Accordingly, M&M sold its 15 percent share in Ford India and the US company, its undisclosed holding in M&M.

He calls himself “The Rideshare Guy” and he’s become one of the more prolific voices covering the still-burgeoning business.
When Uber and Lyft were at the point in development that they were considered by some to be just another fly-by-night constituent of the gig economy craze, Los Angeles-area engineer Harry Campbell started driving part‑time for both app-based firms and he also started a blog on ridesharing.
As a structural engineer working on fleetwide problems for Boeing Co.’s 757 aircraft, he was doing well for himself. But in a short amount of time, his ridesharing blog took off, so three years ago he quit his day job to focus on the blog full‑time.
The blog, which has everything from articles to podcasts to YouTube videos, currently reports 500,000 views a month.
Eventually, the blog launched a video training course to help educate rideshare drivers on subjects that range from getting started to how to make more money as a driver, and it also has a running list of insurance carriers that offer rideshare insurance.
The Rideshare Guy spoke with Insurance Journal on ridesharing matters that our readers may have an interest in. This has been edited for brevity and clarity.
Insurance Journal: Can you talk about how ridesharing has changed in the last two or three years?
The Rideshare Guy: One of the biggest changes we’ve seen in the past few years is that rideshare has become mainstream. I think that when you start to hear your parents and your grandparents talking about Uber and Lyft, you know that the companies have really made it.
When these services were first starting, it wasn’t a sure thing that they were going to take over like they have. Uber has grown into a worldwide brand. It’s become a service that’s extremely popular with drivers, with passengers, and consumers. That’s what we’ve seen, an explosive growth and probably not going to stop any time soon.
IJ: What some of the hot button issues in ridesharing today?
The Rideshare Guy: Coming from the perspective of a driver, one thing we’ve seen over the past three years is that rates have actually come down significantly. You probably notice this as a passenger consumer that taking an Uber around the city is now cheaper than ever. It’s up to 50 to 70 percent cheaper than a taxi in many large cities. That’s great for consumers and passengers, but definitely a downside for the drivers is that they’re obviously making less than ever.
We surveyed over 1,100 drivers earlier in the year. They reported making an average hourly earnings of $16. That’s actually before expenses. Drivers, since they’re independent contractors, they’re responsible for gas, and maintenance, and depreciation on their vehicle and even rideshare insurance. They have to cover all of those costs.
You can see that the trend is that the pay for these drivers is getting closer to more of a minimum wage or a service type job even though not everyone has that impression.

IJ: What would you tell our insurance professional listeners about ridesharing that they should know?
The Rideshare Guy: One of the shocking stats that I see is that most drivers don’t have rideshare insurance. We’ve surveyed our audience and seen, depending on the surveys we’ve done in the past, 60 to 80 percent of drivers don’t have rideshare insurance.
That provides for a big issue for drivers just because they receive coverage while they’re en route to a passenger or while they’re on a trip.
They actually don’t have coverage when they have the app on and they don’t have a passenger yet, when they’re waiting for a passenger. Personal insurance won’t cover that. Uber and Lyft only provide state minimum liability and no collision coverage.
That speaks to what we see with drivers in general. You have a lot of drivers that get into working for Uber and Lyft, just looking to make a few hundred bucks a week. They’re just looking to do a side hustle. They’re looking to make some part‑time cash.
Of course, you also have full‑time drivers. But I think a majority of drivers are doing about 10 to 15 hours a week or less.
You have a lot of people who aren’t aware that they might even need rideshare insurance. They aren’t aware of the reporting and the tax requirements. There’s a big education component.
IJ: How can insurance agents approach drivers to educate them and even drum up a little business?
The Rideshare Guy: If you listen to that stat that a majority of drivers don’t have rideshare insurance, a lot of agents have seen that as a pretty big opportunity.
For insurance agents that are out there listening, I think that there’s actually some pretty easy steps that you can take. The most obvious would be when you’re in an Uber and Lyft, talking to drivers, asking them about their insurance situation, and just helping them understand and educate them as opposed to selling them on the rideshare insurance.
We get lots of emails from drivers who get into accidents and don’t realize that Lyft had a $2,500 collision deductible. If you’re a State Farm agent for example, State Farm actually provides rideshare insurance that will cover you even if you’re on a trip. You won’t ever have to worry about Lyft’s collision deductible. That education component is definitely important, taking rides with drivers.
But also going to the places where drivers hang out. This could be airport lots. Drivers have to sit in a queue waiting for rides at the airport. There might be 50 to 100 drivers sitting there for up to an hour that are very bored and very attentive.
Then, there’s also places like after a sporting event. I’m here in Los Angeles. Towards the end of Dodger games and Rams football, there are hundreds of drivers out there waiting for the game to end so that passengers can come out. They can get their ride. There’re definitely places if you go out there and do a little looking.

Would you let your child use a rideshare app? A newly-launched program in Denver hopes so.
HopSkipDrive has expanded to Denver after running for about three-and-a-half years in California.
Founded by three working moms, including one Denver native, the rideshare service is like Uber for kids. Families can schedule rides for their children online or through the app, but it must be done at least eight hours in advance. It serves kids ages six and up.

“If you know of a certain day you’re going to be need a ride for your kid to school or activities, you can arrange that ride as far in advance as you want so you know someone will be there to pick your kid up and bring them to their next location,” Kelsey Kuenstler, HopSkipDrive Operations Associate for Denver, said.
The people behind the service realize the issue of safety is a main concern. According to Kuenstler, all drivers go through an extensive background check and interview before being hired, and parents receive a picture of the driver, their full bio, and a history of their child care experience.
“We have a two-way verification process, so not only is the driver able to verify this is the correct child, but the child is able to verify that this is the correct driver,” she said.

“Children with their parents come up with a word like ice cream or pizza, something specific to that child and parent that they know, and then that driver is giving the code word to the child so the child knows that’s the driver that’s supposed to be driving them to wherever they’re going next.”
Angela Coleman was scrolling through Facebook when she saw a post from HopSkipDrive on her feed. After going through the background check and interview process, she is now a driver.
“My first ride was Monday. It was awesome and it was a lot of fun,” Coleman said. “I went to a dance studio and to a home, and dropped off a very nice individual. We listened to some Broadway show tunes along the way.”
Coleman is a mother and understands the safety concerns. She said she did a lot of research about the service and advises others to do the same before using it.

A first for Saskatchewan and for Canada – a 100 per cent electric and solar powered car sharing program launched Tuesday in Saskatoon.
It’s part of the CarShare Co-operative that already exists with two regular gas-powered vehicles in its fleet in the Broadway neighbourhood.
The new solar powered electric car’s home base is a charging station in the City Park neighbourhood.
The co-operative has plans to add additional electric cars in the near future.
“Usually they have about 140 kilometre driving range,” Allyson Brady, with the Saskatchewan Environmental Society, said during Tuesday’s unveiling.
“In the winter that range is a little lower so that’s something we want to be aware of.”












The vehicles are accessible to anyone who is interested for a 25 cent per kilometre fee and an hourly rate with a one-time $500 to $750 membership or, for casual drivers, the membership fee is waived but they’re charged a $10 monthly fee instead.






“People generally will use the vehicles for short trips like going to get groceries or maybe heading to a meeting on the other side of town,” Saskatoon CarShare Co-operative co-ordinator Megan VanBuskirk said.
By adding this new car to the fleet, VanBuskirk anticipates this will help grow the co-operative’s membership of 70 people.

Just six months ago, Bird created an electric scooter sharing program in Los Angeles, California. It’s received a $100 million raise as investors believe it can become the biggest player in the industry. With the money, the last-mile service plans to launch in 50 new cities by the end of the year.


New Series B funding took place less than a month after receiving $15 million in the middle of February. It’s grown incredibly popular over the past half-year in Los Angeles due to the ease of picking up and using the dockless e-scooters. Over in China, the scooter’s established growth has created more sustainable transportation.


“I think it speaks to how big of a vision this is, to use short-range electric vehicles and electric-scooter sharing to replace a lot of car usage,” Travis VanderZanden, CEO and founder of Bird, told the Financial Times. “It’s a huge opportunity to have a big impact on the world.”


Investors are hailing Bird to be “the next Uber” in ridesharing, though the structure of the business between the two are quite different. However, Uber had just a fraction of what Bird made in their Series B funding, which was $32 million in 2011. It also happened 18 months into their lifespan, a year further along than Bird.

 


The process of using an electric scooter through Bird is pretty simple. Using their mobile app, one can be traced and reserved.
Then, a detailed description on how to safely ride the e-scooter to a specified destination spans across multiple screens.
In the evening hours, various Birds laying around are picked up and moved to a storefront that accepts hosting them.


An issue of following basic traffic laws in California has cropped up during its short run. While Bird says they don’t have control over it, the City of Santa Monica believes they shouldn’t be able to ignore laws such as not wearing a helmet and having a license for a motorized scooter.
Despite potential for the city to limit the service, these issues haven’t stopped a massive amount of funding on the project.


On the positive side, Bird provides an environmentally friendly last-mile service. Unlike Uber and traditional vehicles, these scooters don’t give off any carbon emissions.
They’re also very beneficial to urban areas that want to decrease the amount of vehicles on the road and university campuses that are spaced out.


Bird joins various other electric scooter and bike sharing startups that are looking to cash in on the trend. However, they may have a leg-up on the competition with how cheap it costs to use the e-scooters ($1 per ride and $0.15 per minute) and the massive funding they received.
They’re looking to expand to over 50 cities by the end of the year. Most of their targets will be in the US, but they will be looking toward other places around the world as well.

Meituan will acquire 100 percent of loss-making Mobike for US$2.7 billion, according to a person briefed on the terms, who asked not to be named as the information was not public. Yicai, a Chinese news website, earlier reported the deal size.
Meituan CEO Wang Xing said in a social media posting that the Beijing-based company will “build a new future with Mobike.” Hu Weiwei, a co-founder of Mobike, said in a WeChat post that “it is a new beginning” and that there’s “huge space for imagination” to work with Meituan.
China’s internet companies are expanding beyond their traditional confines as they seek to cross-sell products and services to their users.  Meituan is the world’s fourth largest unicorn with a valuation of US$30 billion, behind Xiaomi and above Airbnb in the ranking, according to CB Insights.
Meituan started off as a group-buying portal, before it merged with Dianping, a restaurant recommendation site. The combined entity is now pushing into food delivery and recently introduced ride-hailing in several Chinese cities.
The deal comes amid the further consolidation of the bicycle-sharing industry in China and Meituan’s ramped up effort to expand into the country’s transportation-on-demand sector.
Bicycle-sharing has took off in late 2016 in China with dozens of startups placing millions of two-wheelers on city sidewalks, funded by venture capital money.
At stake is an industry that is potentially worth about 24 billion yuan (US$3.8 billion) by 2019, according to market research firm iResearch. Beyond the rental revenue and prospects for advertising, bike-sharing companies are also seen by Chinese tech giants as effective tools to promote mobile payments and to collect user data that in theory can be analysed for consumer patterns useful for a broader internet-enabled transportation industry that involves ride-hailing and the rental business of cars, motorbike and bicycles.


The acquisition will give Mobike a bigger backer in Meituan as it pursues market dominance in bicycle sharing against its competitor Ofo, according to Zhao Xiang, an analyst at Beijing-based consultancy Analysys.
“The tie-up with Mobike is also expected to help Meituan gain more customers data to help its push into transportation,” Zhao said.
Mobike raised US$600 million last June in a financing round led by Tencent, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Meituan-Mobike combination.
Mobike’s chief competitor Ofo is backed by e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding, which owns the South China Morning Post.  Ofo said it did not have a comment for now, when asked how the Meituan-Mobike acquisition will affect its strategy. Alibaba also did not immediately comment.
The purchase of Mobike will add bicycle-sharing to Meituan’s suite of services for its 320 million annual active buyers. In October 2017, Meituan-Dianping closed its Series C financing round, raising US$4.1 billion for future investment, according to a company statement.
The number of hotel room bookings on Meituan’s platform exceeded 200 million in 2017 and the firm signed a global partnership with resorts chain Club Med to provide a one-stop vacation booking service.

Innovative products, effective distribution models and wider use of technology are required for the growth of insurance in India. Pushan Mahapatra, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of SBI General Insurance, talks with Teena Jain Kaushal on how the industry is gearing up for changes.
Q: Several new players are about to enter the general insurance space. Will it lead to aggressive pricing?
A: The general insurance space has been fairly competitive in terms of pricing even before the emergence of the recent entrants. The competition meant insurers must focus on innovation in products and processes. For retail products, servicing, brand and reach of the insurer also play an important part.
Q: How are insurers integrating technology for effective claim settlements?
A:Some key technologies which will impact claim settlements include the availability of e-KYC (know your customer), mobile payments, customer’s self-service options for claim logging and tracking, telematics data and location data tracking. These technologies are not yet extensively used, but as they lead to better loss control, their adoption is likely to increase. Some use cases such as accessing third party data (say, flight cancellations) to process trip delay claims automatically have already emerged. Given the cost efficiency of such low-ticket claims, technology adoption may be faster in those areas.
We are also exploring cloud technology for various claims processes such as net promoter score, in-house investigations and motor claims. It is likely to help us because of its state-of-the-art security features, ease of application, and reduced processing and infrastructure cost. We are working closely with OEM partners to automate claims processes and provide seamless services to our customers.
Moreover, mobile platforms are replacing traditional communication channels in the latest processes. They provide mobility solutions to on-field assessors and synchronise data with core platforms on the go. The technology further reduces the time taken, quickens decision making and ensures complete control, especially when integrated with a live audio-video solution. SBI General has realised its benefit in motor claims processing. We are going to expand it to other lines of business.



Q: How can blockchain help?
A:Blockchain can remove the need for a trusted third party acting as a mediator. Blockchain usage in insurance could include self-survey of loss by a customer and a disintermediated claims processing using machines. So, potentially, a customer may only have to log a claim and send pictures of the loss, and it could be approved straightaway. The blockchain we use can be integrated with the existing infrastructure to reduce turnaround time and the resources utilised. It validates the data using a feature called Smart Contracts, and customers get their claims through an entirely automated process.
Q: Some insurers have hiked health insurance premium rates, especially for senior citizens. Whys that?
A: As people get older, they become more susceptible to medical conditions. There could be secondary complications, too, which may further increase the cost of treatment. Insurers need to review their premium rates more frequently and ensure that they are sufficiently priced for claims payment. But they can try and moderate premiums across age bands so that the hike is not borne by the higher age band customers alone. Thus, the premium will remain affordable for senior citizens.
Q: Depression is a big problem worldwide but no health insurance policy covers it in India. Why is it so?
A: Currently, treatment of any mental illness is not covered – it is part of the general exclusions of retail health products. But a few insurance companies cover psychosomatic disorders as part of their group health plans. One interesting development is the Mental Healthcare Act 2017, which looks at facilitating mental health coverage for all. The Bill makes it mandatory for insurers to provide insurance to the mentally ill. So, companies need to gear up to provide such coverage under their health insurance plans.
Q: Will telematics in motor insurance bring the premium down?
A:Telematics is a mechanism to record and monitor driving behaviour. It is used worldwide for two specific purposes, which impact the premium – pay how you drive and pay as you drive. ‘Pay how you drive’ is relevant for countries where insurance is offered on named driver basis unlike India, where the vehicle is underwritten. More relevant is ‘pay as you drive’ due to the vast car ownership but limited usage of cars for a large segment of vehicle owners.
Telematics should not be seen as a means to lower premium. It is a tool to ascertain the correct premium based on a customer’s risk exposure. For instance, ‘in pay as you drive’, vehicles driven less should be charged less and those driven more should be charged more, which is not the case in India.
Q: What innovations may we see in health and motor insurance space?
A: In the motor insurance space, there could be innovations in terms of service offerings and customer journey, using technology at every step. On the product side, the current offering is almost standard and more than sufficient for the market conditions. On the health side, the pie is growing at a steady pace. But there is a need to further penetrate the market by using innovative products, improved sales mechanism and better distribution models. Also, there is a need for sachet size products for specific requirements

Stuttgart – car2go, the world’s largest flexible carshare service, continues to experience rapid growth and is proof of how quickly carsharing is gaining momentum. Just 15 months after the pioneer and global market leader in the flexible carsharing sector surpassed two million members worldwide, car2go has now reached the next milestone: in January, car2go exceeded the three million member mark.
“Reaching the three million car2go member milestone so quickly shows how popular our flexible carsharing model really is in cities around the world,” said Olivier Reppert, CEO of the car2go Group GmbH. “We achieved strong 30 percent year over year membership growth in 2017 and there is still huge potential for further growth. Studies project that the number of people who carshare will increase fivefold over the next few years. That car2go is the first carsharing provider to break the three million member mark is no coincidence: our app was just rated best of 2017 by TIME Magazine, our extremely fast, flexible rental process and the premium smart and Mercedes-Benz cars we offer. car2go, is pushing carsharing to a completely new level and we remain committed as ever to improving urban quality of life through mobility.”
It took four years from the official start of car2go’s service in 2010 to reach the one-millionth member, while the two million member milestone was achieved in just over two years, in September 2016. car2go’s three million members are spread across 26 locations on three continents. The majority of customers use car2go in Europe (1.7 million), closely followed by North America (one million). In China, 237,000 customers are currently registered in their car2go location in Chongqing, thus making it the city with the most car2go customers worldwide, followed by Berlin (223,000 customers) and Madrid (196,000). The top ten list is completed with Hamburg (184,000), Milan (170,000), Rome (166,000), Vancouver (155,000), Vienna (142,000), Calgary (120,000) and the Rhineland (117,000).

Mercedes-Benz and BMW have been the fiercest of rivals for more than a hundred years. Now, they’re teaming up to pursue the future of mobility together. In a surprise announcement, Daimler and BMW revealed plans to merge their respective mobility services business units and strategically expand their existing mobility offerings in the areas of car-sharing, ride-hailing, real-time parking, electric vehicle charging and on-demand mobility.
Specifically, the companies will fuse their car-sharing companies, Car2Go and DriveNow. They’ll combine their respective ride-hailing outfits, mytaxi, Chauffeur Privé, Clever Taxi and Beat. BMW’s ParkNow and Daimler’s Parkmobile Group/Parkmobile LLC will become one, as will BMW’s ChargeNow and Daimler’s Digital Charging Solutions. The companies will integrate their on-demand mobility services moovel(Mercedes) and ReachNow (BMW). Each company will hold a 50% stake in the joint venture. The deal is pending regulatory approval and the two companies promise to remain bitter competitors as carmakers.
In other news, a week after a self-driving Uber struck and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, fallout continued for the ride-hailing company. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey called the accident “disturbing and alarming”and told Uber that it was no longer welcome to test its self-driving cars on Arizona roads. The California DMV announced that it would not renew Uber’s test permit for self-driving cars until Uber addresses all follow-up analysis of the Tempe crash. Uber had already grounded its entire self-driving vehicle fleet and Nvidia, which supplies Uber with the graphics processing unit for its self-driving tech, followed suit last week when it suspended all public testing of its own self-driving vehicles, even though it simultaneously sought to distance itself from Uber’s technology in the wake of the crash.
Waymo said that its technology would have avoided the crash, no problem. Mobileye made the same assurance and Lyft said that both the Uber car and the safety driver behind the wheel should have been able to avoid the crash. That seems to have sufficed for now to allow these companies to keep testing their cars on public roads but pressure will continue to mount on the sector as more fatal accidents continue to pile up, as they inevitably will. See Robots will make fatal mistakes, Continental concedes.
Speaking of mishaps, a Tesla Model X engaged in autonomous mode slammed into an impact attenuator on California Highway 101 last week, killing its driver. Tesla has put out its usual response, that the mode requires human intervention. In this case, it doubled down on deflection, pointing out that the driver had set the adaptive cruise control follow distance to a minimum and that the system had warned the driver to intervene and, also, that the attenuator had been damaged previously. The driver, Walter Huang, was an engineer at Apple and, his family alleges, had taken his car to the Tesla dealership several times to complain that autonomous mode was not functioning properly.
Meanwhile in San Francisco a self-driving Chevy Bolt was slapped with a ticket from the SF Police for failure to yield to a pedestrian. General Motor’s Cruise Automotivedisputes that its technology did anything wrong. “Safety is our priority in testing our self-driving vehicles,” it said in a statement. “California law requires the vehicle to yield the right of way to pedestrians, allowing them to proceed undisturbed and unhurried without fear of interference of their safe passage through an intersection. Our data indicates that’s what happened here.”
With all of this going on, it was easy to forget about the New York Auto Show, the largest car show in North America. The showstopper was Jaguar’s all-new, all-electric I-PACE, which debuted at Geneva but showed up in New York with a new logo emblazoned on its side: Waymo. The two companies announced that up to 20,000 I-PACEs with Waymo self-driving tech will be built in the first two years of I-PACE production and that these vehicles will become the first all-electric vehicles in Waymo’s driverless fleet. On-road testing will begin later this year.
Hyundai unveiled its first electric crossover for the US market, the Kona Electric. The EV has an estimated range of 250 miles on a single charge and comes packed with advanced driver assistance features, such as lane keeping assist, blind-spot collision warning and forward collision-avoidance assist with pedestrian detection, all under the Hyundai Smart Sense umbrella. The car also features Hyundai’s Blue Link connected car system.
Finally, across the country, EV start-up and potential Tesla rival SF Motors unveiled a medium-sized crossover SUV called the SF5 that will be available for pre-order by the end of 2018 and will ship in 2019. The SF5 has impressive specs: it claims a 0 to 60mph sprint in under three seconds and has a powertrain with 1,000 horsepower. It also will feature what SF Motors calls “protective autonomy”, which combines deep neural network-based computer vision and LiDAR to power Level 3 autonomy.

Tenants at a seniors residence in West Vancouver are being given the option to ditch their own rides in favour of joining a one of a kind car share program.
Kiwanis North Shore Housing Society announced Sept. 27 that it had partnered with Modo, a Vancouver-based car sharing co-op, to launch an innovative program at the housing society’s Garden Village location in West Vancouver.

Effective immediately, residents who signed up for the program will have access to one of Modo’s 2018 Honda Fits at a greatly reduced rate.
The partnership between a seniors residence and car sharing co-op marks a first for Modo, which was founded in 1997 and lays claim to having the oldest car sharing program in the region.

“What makes this program really different is that it’s a dedicated car share program, and it’s the only one like it,” said Selena McLachlan, Modo’s director of marketing and business development.
Garden Village residents will have the luxury of being the sole users of the residence’s Modo vehicle.
Modo has struck exclusive usage deals with organizations in the past, but the recent partnership marks a first when it comes to joining forces with a seniors home.
McLachlan said the co-op members hope the partnership can encourage similar unions going forward.

“We’re hoping that other seniors organizations that have residential developments like this will look to Kiwanis as being a leader and setting the stage for what can be done,” McLachlan said.
Kiwanis president Patrick McLaughlin said he was thrilled at the new partnership and at the opportunity it presents to residents.
The housing society, which operates seven residences across the North Shore that house approximately 700 tenants, had been looking into doing a car share program throughout the last year.
After connecting with Modo, the partnership was established quickly, he said.
“We contacted three car share companies and Modo was the only one that offered a program where you could secure a dedicated car for a particular use.”
Kiwanis operates residences for seniors in need of below-market accommodation. For low-income seniors, making the transition from owning and operating a vehicle to using a car share could potentially save thousands of dollars every year, McLaughlin said.
“It represents a significant savings, but they still have the independence of having a car that they can go and get.”
Two workshops were held over the summer informing Garden Village residents about the program and how they could get signed up. More than a dozen have enrolled so far. While the Kiwanis car share program is something of a pilot project for the housing society,  it’s expected to grow, McLaughlin said.
“The other large one we have is up in Lynn Valley, it’s a building we call the Kiwanis Lynn Manor and it has 200 residents in it right now. That’s the next location that we would like to get a car share.”

The insurance industry is in the midst of a radical, digitally infused shake-up. Customers are embracing digital channels, and technologies such as the connected car, smart home solutions, and artificial intelligence (AI) have ushered in an era of new products built on data and analytics. Attackers—insurers with pure-play digital business models, such as Lemonade in the United States, Youse in Latin America, or Nexible in Europe—are using digital applications such as chatbots to turn the process of buying a policy or filing a claim into a fast, simple, and satisfying experience. This approach is a far cry from the analog, and often frustrating, processes of traditional insurers.
With new attackers on the hunt for customers, incumbents must move quickly to integrate digital technologies into their operations. For the property and casualty (P&C) industry, digitizing the claims function holds tremendous potential. To capture the value of digital,1 P&C claims functions must embark on a transformation to become a customer-centric, digitally enabled organization that excels in the three foundational areas of claims—customer experience, efficiency, and effectiveness. In our experience, a digital claims function can boost performance on all three KPIs and generate significant value (Exhibit 1).

Exhibit 1
 



As companies have attempted to understand the succession of customer interactions across traditional and digital channels, the concept of the customer journey has gained more prominence.1 Customer journeys comprise a succession of touchpoints and are typically defined by a specific customer objective. Examining interactions with customers as part of a journey rather than a series of individual touchpoints allows insurers to better understand how different parts of the organization must work together to provide a seamless experience.
In the insurance industry, discrete customer journeys can be triggered, for example, by the need to buy a policy, change an address, or submit and resolve a claim. For submitting and resolving a claim, the journey starts even before the claim is submitted, as an insurer can take steps to prevent an accident or damage. When a customer does submit a claim, the first notification of loss (FNOL) initiates the claims process, which further consists of claims management, loss assessment and repair, and claims settlement. Digitizing the claims process involves redesigning the process flow from the customer perspective and applying technology to facilitate each step in the back-end of the customer journey. In this way, insurers can be more responsive to customer requests, automate low-value transactions, and expedite the claims process. Throughout this article, we will revisit this customer journey to demonstrate how the enabling elements support it at each step.
Watch the video feature, “What is customer journey?.”


So where to start? A true digital redesign of claims integrates a relentless focus on the customer with a value-driven approach. Insurers should adopt a customer-centric mind-set and undertake an end-to-end reassessment of their customer interactions—starting with the most relevant customer journeys (see sidebar “The claims customer journey”). For maximum impact, claims functions should develop a digital value proposition and an aspirational future state for a digital claims function first and then prioritize into a transformation road map. This article examines the five essential elements needed to digitize and transform claims.
Elements of a successful digital claims transformation
In our experience, successful digital transformations in claims begin with developing a new value proposition that sets a high-level aspiration and pursuing an end-to-end digitization of the claims customer journey.2 The development of a truly innovative customer journey can be achieved by integrating with three other areas—AI and digital technologies, the digital integration of the claims ecosystem, and a new digital operating model (Exhibit 2). Together, these five elements give management the strategy and tools to both transform claims into a digital function and improve performance on all of the three foundational KPIs.

Exhibit 2
 

New digital value proposition for claims
For the digital age, the claims value proposition—that is, the value an insurer can provide to its customers through the claims process—needs to go beyond traditional after-the-fact claims management. The value proposition sets the aspirational goal of offering excellent omnichannel customer experience supported by intuitive digital processes. Insurers should aim to adopt a faster, analytics-driven approach to claims handling and fully automate the claims handling processes for clear and simple cases. For example, Lemonade has worked to redefine the customer experience with an innovative, chatbot-based FNOL system that creates automated claims payouts within seconds.3 In addition to working actively with customers to prevent claims, insurers should provide services that add value for and delight customers and draw on customer feedback to continually improve service offerings, usability, and performance.
Instilling this upgraded value proposition within the organization is an often-underestimated element of a digital transformation. Top and middle management in claims should become champions for the new value proposition; otherwise, they risk finding themselves halfway through the digital transformation without the necessary company-wide buy-in to stay the course.
End-to-end digitization of the claims customer journey
At the core of the claim function’s digital transformation is a redesign of the claims customer journey. There is no silver bullet interaction that ensures customer satisfaction, but a successful redesign typically involves considering processes from the customer perspective and optimizing back-office processes accordingly to provide simple and fast claims services.
Insurers should start with an “everything is possible” mind-set to unleash truly transformative ideas. Satisfaction surveys in claims consistently show that customers desire a fast and intuitive process as well as transparency on where they are in the process and what happens next. Accordingly, the digital redesign of a claims journey needs to go much deeper than superficial process improvements. Adeslas, a Spanish company, has worked to complete an end-to-end digitization of their claims journey, implementing features such as multichannel FNOL, automated claims segmentation, and digital claims status tracking.
To determine how digital technologies can unlock value and improve the claims customer journey from start to finish, managers should examine each step of the journey with the following areas in mind and start to develop an aspirational future state for claims that is unconstrained by potential short-term, technological barriers:
Product simplification
Customers want simple and fast digital interactions, but complex coverage details that include many specific exceptions can create barriers. Large numbers of legacy products with different coverage details also make it difficult to implement and maintain the technology systems necessary to improve efficiency. A carrier should find ways to simplify products and reduce product generations to ease the development of fully digital customer journeys.
Customer and intermediary self-service
Insurers have the opportunity to shift simple, routine transactions from claims handlers to intermediaries, such as agents and brokers, or customers themselves. Examples include an intuitive online tool for FNOL and an online self-scheduling tool for claims adjuster appointments. As with any self-service tool, insurers must precisely define the necessary information, for example, where the customer can find his or her policy number. They must also build in support in case customers need it, such as online-chat with a claims handler or easy-to-find FAQs. Further, seamless handoffs across channels are critical: customers who start their journey online but want to talk to a claims handler or agent halfway through should be able to do so without having to repeat steps or information. This functionality requires that all system interfaces follow an identical structure and logic.

Intelligent case management
After FNOL and throughout the process, handlers typically evaluate claims cases manually to decide on appropriate next steps, such as scheduling an adjuster appointment or providing information about direct repair programs with local repair shops. Supporting the entire journey with automated, intelligent case management is critical to establishing truly end-to-end digital customer journeys. With the help of AI, a digital evaluation automatically identifies the best next step in a specific customer journey, reduces manual touchpoints, and significantly speeds up the claims process. For example, in a simple claim, this technology can allow a customer to schedule an appointment with a repair shop as part of the FNOL. Enriching these journeys with insights from behavioral economics can help customers to follow the the most satisfying and efficient paths in their claims journeys.
Frontline and back-office process digitization
Claims handlers and adjusters manually carry out often-complex tasks, leading to significantly divergent results. Digital tools and systems can simplify and standardize manual processes. For example, tablet-based calculation tools for home damages can help claims adjusters estimate the value of losses faster and more accurately and consistently—even if this means that indemnity payments may increase for certain cases. Standardized reports and calculation methods will leave customers with a comprehensive overview of how their claim was calculated. This results in higher customer satisfaction and a leaner process with reduced follow-ups and recalculations or litigation.
Back-office automation
Insurers can achieve the greatest efficiency gains by fully automating back-office processes. Customers benefit significantly from faster claims processing—for instance, through automated verification of car repair estimates and invoices as well as automatic reimbursements as soon as the repair invoice has been verified. In addition, digital tools can support and assist the decisions of claims handlers, leading to better outcomes.
Communication
Providing customers with the necessary information in digital channels offers customers the sense of control they desire. The quality of communication can raise customer awareness and usage of digital self-service tools throughout their journey. One US insurer, for example, implemented a digital case-tracking tool and reduced the number of status request calls by more than 50 percent.
By examining each of these areas, claims functions can start to rethink the claims customer journey and back-office processes. This approach should be synthesized into an aspirational future state outlining the digital assets needed to achieve the ideal state (Exhibit 3). Claims leaders should prioritize these digital assets based on the value they can generate. For example, digitizing invoice reviews and automating payment processing often significantly reduces processing time.

Enabling truly innovative customer journeys
Offering truly innovative customer journeys requires a combination of AI and upgrades to technology platforms as well as the digital integration of partners in the claims industry ecosystem. A greater understanding of these elements and the digital operating model needed to bring them to life can help claims managers make the proper investments.

Defining AI

Artificial Intelligence—that is, intelligence exhibited by machines—is brought one step closer by recent advances in algorithms (for example, machine and deep learning).1 Still, the now-evolving AIs are exclusively “applied AIs.” In contrast to generalized AI, they are highly specialized on certain tasks and can learn and operate only within this predefined area. Applied AI is also often referred to as advanced analytics.
Possible applications for applied AI range from uncovering hidden patterns from structured data (for example, the claims database) to harnessing image recognition (for example, Tractable’s picture-based claims segmentation) or natural language processing (such as Amazon Alexa or Rasa’s enterprise AI platform for chatbots).2
Watch the video feature, “What’s driving today’s progress in AI?.” This video is one in a five-part Ask the AI Experts series that answers top-of-mind questions about the technology.


Digital customer journeys require not only the AI-enabled automation of decisions traditionally made by claims handlers but also an IT architecture that supports real-time digital interactions with customers (see sidebar “Defining AI”). While AI should ideally support the entire customer journey, it can generate significant value by automating claims management. Ageas UK, for instance, is working with Tractable to integrate the latest AI and picture recognition applications to segment claims cases in real time.4 The following three modules lay the basis for real-time engagement:
Prediction of claims characteristics
AI can help infer as-yet-unknown characteristics of a claim, such as the likelihood of fraud, total loss, or litigation, to speed up its downstream handling. A European insurance carrier, for example, significantly improved its fraud detection accuracy implementing an AI-based fraud detection system resulting in an 18 percent increase in fraud prevention as well as productivity gains in fraud investigation. And leading players in automotive can estimate a vehicle’s damage value in real time at FNOL based on customer pictures or a damage description, using the latest advances in AI and picture recognition.
Claims segmentation
AI algorithms can help segment claims cases by complexity using factual and predicted claims characteristics. Based on this segmentation, claims can be assigned to specific downstream handling processes—either one of the fully digital self-service journeys (such as selecting a direct repair shop in self-service) or a claims handler for more complex cases (for example, with high litigation risk).
Supported claims handling
Going beyond the first two modules, AI can support in finding the optimal claims handling process for a specific claim: A global insurance carrier, for example, leveraged AI to derive business rules to identify clear and simple claims cases suitable for an automated process. An Italian insurance carrier is even going further and developed a “best-match” routing approach to find the best-experienced claims handler for a specific case and this way significantly improves its claims handling accuracy (Exhibit 4).5

Exhibit 4
 

Integrating real-time customer interactions and insights from AI modules into customer journeys poses vastly different requirements for the IT architecture. While in the past, online interactions with the customer were only one way (for example, saving the details of an online FNOL into the claims database), interactive digital customer journeys require real-time, bidirectional interactions. A new IT architecture concept—generally referred to as two-speed architecture—is required to complement the stability of the core claims database with responsive features on the front end. A middle layer connects the traditional, slow claims database with customer-facing interfaces and runs AI modules. This functionality connects the information a user submits with insights from AI in real time to populate online forms and offer direct feedback to the customer.
Digital integration of the claims ecosystem
For competitive differentiation and ownership of the customer in a claims case, insurance carriers need to proactively manage more (ideally all) processes related to a customer’s claim—also those involving third parties. For example, the German claims solution provider Control€xpert digitally integrates with insurance carriers and repair shops to automate its invoice-verification process. Other providers offer appointment scheduling with repair shops and rental car companies. By providing a fully integrated digital experience, claims functions can become the true and sole owners of customer contact in a claims case.
To combine such offers into efficient, digital, self-service journeys, insurance carriers need to digitally integrate with relevant players in the larger claims ecosystem (Exhibit 5). In addition, a digital integration can vastly improve efficiency in communication between the ecosystem parties and speed the claims processing for the customer. As this type of digital integration is currently rare, a carrier can become the ecosystem integrator, harnessing the best of the ecosystem for its customers.

Exhibit 5
 

Given the complexity of this integration, carriers should prioritize pursuing digital interfaces with the players that are involved in a high number of claims cases. In auto insurance, for example, these players would be roadside assistance services, claims assessors, and repair-shop networks, as well as invoice control service providers. Insurers don’t need to start from zero. In many markets, insurtechs have started to lead the digital integration, for example, by digitally connecting car repair shops and enabling digital cost-estimate and invoice transmission. Insurers should explore partnerships with existing offerings to further digitize and integrate the claims ecosystem.
New operating model for the digital age
A successful digital transformation radically reinvents the claims customer journey with the help of AI, digital technologies, and the claims ecosystem. To support these efforts, the claims department needs to pursue deep, cross-functional collaboration with other functions such as marketing and IT. Bringing the transformation to life requires new roles, including data scientists, customer journey “owners,” and user experience designers, as well as a digital way of working, which must be instilled in the organization. This approach involves learning by doing, which takes time to implement but can be jump-started in the following ways:

The digitization of each customer journey should start with a short design phase. Ideally, design thinking techniques are used to iteratively develop the best possible end-to-end customer journey. This process directly integrates consumer feedback on ideas and concepts.
Successful players quickly move from the drawing board to prototype development. Progress is best made with agile development methods, such as creating and improving a minimal viable product in ten-day intervals and then quickly evolving the prototype. Early customer testing and the resulting feedback are continually incorporated into the development of digital channels and solutions to ensure the customer’s experience of the evolving digital claims journey continually surpasses expectation.

As this new approach can represent a substantial change, success depends on deeply integrating a digital way of working into the entire organization. For example, Allianz’s Global Digital Factory launched a digital delivery hub to achieve change through digital projects, such as developing claims solutions, across its international operations. Successful organizations tap joint cross-functional management teams to lead the effort, develop experts in all digital methods, and provide intensive coaching for all relevant employees.

Purely digital industry attackers have raised the bar for performance by showcasing simple and intuitive customer interfaces, making it imperative for incumbent carriers to radically redesign their claims customer journeys. Those insurers that move swiftly and decisively to transform the claims function can equip themselves to deliver against the new, higher customer expectations—while increasing efficiency and improving claims handling accuracy in the process.

Pony.ai has become the first company to offer the public self-driving car rides on city roads in China, having launched an autonomous ride-sharing fleet.
Showcased at an event in Nansha, attendees experienced Pony.ai’s fully self-driving cars on a 2.8km route.
In addition to trial rides, the event also consisted of a signing ceremony that solidified a strategic partnership between the young company and China’s second-largest carmaker, Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC Group).
Commenting on the changing mobility landscape, President of GAC Group, Xingya Feng, explained: “The current global automotive industry is in the process of undergoing profound change.
Automotive products are rapidly becoming smarter, more connected and more lightweight whilst harnessing innovations in alternative energy. Against an ever-progressing backdrop of smart mobility and intelligent transportation, I believe this partnership between GAC Group and Pony.ai will spearhead innovations in automotive and beyond.”
The autonomous cars have already undergone road tests covering thousands of kilometres. Within three months, the autonomous driving platform has learned to deal with unique road scenarios such as congested city streets, extreme weather and unexpected road behaviour.
These scenarios have pushed the Pony.ai team to enhance and refine their algorithms, creating a more sophisticated AI system that is capable of handling more complex road conditions.

The route featured three consecutive lane changes on Phoenix Boulevard, large multi-lane intersections and bridge-crossings involving sloped roads.
Starting at the Nansha Government building, the cars immediately turn onto Phoenix Boulevard – the major traffic roadway of Nansha.
Pony.ai and GAC Group plan to work closely together to make progress in research, development and manufacturing. Their strategic partnership agrees to collaborate in four key areas: further development of self-driving technology, autonomous vehicle operationalisation, broader mobility development and capital partnership.
Harry Hu, COO of Pony.ai, commented: “This partnership has the potential for meaningful global impact and influence. We look forward to working with GAC Group to deliver the most reliable, safe and comprehensive autonomous vehicle experience to the public.”
Tiancheng Lou, co-Founder and CTO of Pony.ai, added: “This year we continued our efforts in research and testing and ultimately realised a breakthrough in autonomous vehicle technology. We are thrilled to give Guangzhou citizens their first opportunity to experience self-driving cars.”

While the “sharing economy” based on communal use of items and spaces has rapidly expanded in China with ride-sharing and other services, sudden service interruptions and unreturned deposits are also rising to the surface.
In July 2017, China‘s largest bookstore operator Anhui Xinhua Distribution Group Holding Co. opened a “sharing bookstore” at the Sanxiaokou Xinhua Bookstore in Hefei, Anhui province .
After downloading a smartphone application, if users made a deposit of 99 yuan (roughly 1,700 yen), then they could check out books for 10 days from the store free of charge. After the 10-day period, 1 yuan per title is charged.
Users can easily read the newest releases, including mystery novels by Keigo Higashino that have gained popularity in China, and the bookstore can also attract a large number of new customers.
In just half a year, the company has expanded the sharing bookstore to 28 locations throughout the country, and users of the app have reportedly exceeded 250,000 people.
“We get positive responses from users like, ‘The bookstore has become a library,'” says Anhui Xinhua publicity manager Lu Qing.
What have also become increasingly common sights in China are “shared umbrellas” concentrated around subway stations. If a user inserts a refundable deposit into the machine, they can use an umbrella for free, only paying an additional fee if they are late in returning the item.
The Chinese have a great affinity for the sharing economy as the use of smartphone apps for making purchases has spread widely around the country, and services originating in North America and Europe like car-sharing, renting rooms in private accommodations and ride-hailing also quickly caught on.
With many new ideas like jewelry and shopping cart sharing, just like the bicycle sharing service already operating in over 20 countries, the sharing economy has given birth to new business opportunities originating in China.
The scale of the Chinese sharing economy in 2016 grew 3.5 trillion yuan compared to the previous year, and had a total of 600 million participants.
The word for “share” in Chinese, “gongxiang,” even made it on the list of China’s top 10 buzzwords of 2017, and President Xi Jinping praised the expansion of the sharing economy as “a new driving force (for the economy),” setting it up for success nationwide.
However, expanding to the size that it has, problems are also rising to the surface. Fierce competition to lower prices for bicycle- and car-sharing has led to worn-out operators abruptly halting services, and problems with deposits not being returned are occurring one after the other.
One business sharing smartphone chargers expanded quickly for a period of time before its popularity died out, forcing the operator to restructure and retire the service. There are also many cases where companies offering ride-hailing and housecleaning services have not signed clear contracts with employees, and trouble involving wage payments and accident management occur frequently.
The National Development and Reform Commission of the People’s Republic of China and other main agencies released a statement about the government’s stance concerning the “sharing economy” in a broad sense in July 2017, and created rules for things such as the strengthening of monitoring systems. “Gongxiang is a ‘new force’ in China’s economy,” it said, “but it is also facing many problems with the system and lack of security.”
These problems with the system aren’t limited to China, but extend overseas to the U.S. and Europe. A major representative of the sharing economy, ride-hailing service provider Uber Technologies Inc., has come under fire for a variety of problems, including drivers assaulting passengers, leading to the service being banned in London and other cities.
Whether or not these types of services can handle the side effects of their rapid growth is an issue the whole world, including Japan, is watching carefully.

P2P carsharing: Valerio Sandri, TEDxCopenhagenSalon:
This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Valerio tells us how car sharing solves a list of practical problems common to all cities in this world: The overcrowded streets with parked cars, the under-used privately owned cars, and the limited access to these cars by non-owners. In 2012 Valerio Sandri felt passionately about concepts like sharing economy, collaborative consumption and peer-to-peer car sharing. One year later, in July 2013, https://minbildinbil.dk/ became the first active person-to-person car sharing platform in Denmark. Valerio believes the advantages of a p2p car sharing platform are many and will create lasting value for local communities.

A Chinese carmaker has launched a vehicle sharing service in Shenzhen by offering a special deal on rental prices that works out cheaper than bike sharing.
GoFun, a car-sharing platform backed by state-owned Shouqi Group, said has put 300 new energy vehicles into service in the southern Chinese city, considered to be China’s Silicon Valley.
The rental cost is just one yuan (US$0.16) per kilometre plus 0.1 yuan per minute, which works out at about half the cost of using Chinese ride hailing service Didi Chuxing. However, new customers can take advantage of a special deal of one yuan for three hours of driving, which is even cheaper than bike-sharing services in the city.
“It is a common strategy for technology companies to use low prices or even free services to attract new users,” said Zhao Ziming, a senior analyst at Beijing-based consultancy Cyzone. “The price will go back to normal when the companies gain a certain market share.”
Carmakers like Shouqi Group are looking to develop vehicle sharing services based on the assumption that future consumers would rather make short-term use of those assets than owning them outright. In February, Didi Chuxing teamed up with 12 Chinese carmakers to develop an electric-vehicle sharing platform.
Shenzhen has a high demand for shared vehicles because only one in 300 people with driving licences can obtain the hard to get licence plates needed to purchase vehicles, said Tan Yi, chief operating officer of GoFun.
After launching vehicle-sharing operations in more than 40 Chinese cities, GoFun now has 1 million monthly active users. Jack Liang, a 30-year old teacher in Beijing, said he prefers using the car-sharing service at railway stations or airports because there is always long queue for a taxi.

“But in my daily life, I prefer using car-hailing service, not driving the shared vehicles by myself,” he said. “It is difficult to find an available car as well as parking. However with a car-hailing service I can get out wherever I want.”
To ensure Shenzhen doesn’t have the same problem, Shouqi said it will have 1,000 vehicles on the road in the city by the end of this year and will rent more dedicated Go Fun parking spaces.
A report from DongXing Securities said the sharing-vehicle business requires high initial investment and operating cost, so most players won’t make a profit in the current environment.
“These who can lower the vehicle production cost or who have cutting-edge technology are more likely to win out ” said the report, which expects the shared vehicle market in China to be worth 9.28 billion yuan in 2020, up from 820 million yuan in 2017.
Unlike China’s ride hailing market which is dominated by Didi Chuxing, there is currently no strong leader in vehicle sharing.
“Vehicle sharing is a niche market and the service, to a large extent, is complementary with the car hailing business,” said Zhao.

Moving people around in a thriving metropolis can be a tricky problem.
Although scheduled services such as trains and buses form the backbone of mass transportation, commuters still prefer the comfort and convenience of on-demand, direct point-to-point modes of transit.
Unsurprisingly, in Singapore, the private car is still regarded as the epitome of urban mobility. However, with the rapid advancement of internet technology and the advent of mobile phone applications, a sharing economy has emerged to challenge the existing paradigm of car ownership.
Uber, Grab, Zipcar and oBike are among the many shared transportation services that have appeared in recent years, granting commuters unprecedented access to personalised urban mobility at attractive price points. “With millions of people in our 719-square-kilometre city-state, demand for transportation services is extremely compact and dense,” says Assistant Professor Wang Hai of the Singapore Management University (SMU) School of Information Systems, who studies the design and operation of transportation systems. “The synergies between conventional transportation systems and on-demand shared systems are vital for Singapore’s effective functioning.”
Finding the right balance Shortages and redundancies are perennial problems faced by conventional transportation systems. During peak hours, the sharp but temporary increase in the volume of commuters puts a strain on public transportation services, especially those that are centrally dispatched and have fixed schedules and capacities.
The knee-jerk reaction to these shortages would be to increase the frequency and total number of taxis, buses and trains. However, such measures are economically untenable, as many of these vehicles (and their operators) could be idle, or redundant, during off-peak hours.
Given these circumstances, a dynamic system that responds to commuter requirements at specific times during the day can be immensely helpful, says Professor Wang. “This is where the shared transportation system comes in to help balance demand and supply,” he explains.
By crowdsourcing for supply of services during shortages, and then releasing it again when demand dwindles, shared transportation services like Grab and Uber help make urban mobility more flexible and efficient.
“Nonetheless, such innovative services pose many planning and operational challenges, including fleet management, driver recruitment, pricing different levels of service and salary- and wage-mechanism design, and matching and dispatching drivers and passengers, among others,” Professor Wang explains. Amid this complexity, Professor Wang draws on various mathematical models and quantitative methodologies—including large-scale optimisation, stochastic analysis, machine learning and statistics—to glean insights and develop methods that could be used to design and operate better urban transportation systems.
“I am deeply interested to learn how the parameters of these multifaceted systems can be tweaked and how diverse algorithms and mechanisms can be implemented to maximise social welfare,” he adds.
Of fares and feasibility One aspect of shared transportation systems that particularly intrigues Professor Wang is the price sensitivity of both the drivers and the commuters. “The shared transportation system is actually a so-called two-sided market,” Professor Wang explains. “Unlike conventional urban services such as bus and train systems with stable and fixed service supply, both supply and demand in shared transportation systems could be affected by pricing, wage and system operations.” For example, during peak hours, surge pricing, which adjusts fare rates according to real-time information, could incentivise private car owners to ply the roads and pick up passengers.
Meanwhile, during off-peak hours, private car owners may see an uptick of ride requests due to cheaper rates. With such a self-regulating and efficient shared transportation system in place, the strain on ‘older’ modes of transportation such as public trains and buses and conventional taxis could be eased during peak hours. Do such optimal scenarios play out in reality? Professor Wang’s short answer to this question is: it’s complicated. “The biggest challenge in my research has been to concisely evaluate the benefits and feasibility of any new shared transportation service or system,” says Professor Wang.
“Potential synergies and competition between new and current services are notably difficult to model, and trials of new systems are typically quite expensive.” Driving a change in mindset Aside from complicated models and real-world trials, learning from the successes and mistakes of others can also grant enlightened perspectives.

Hence, Professor Wang has ventured abroad to seek alternative assessments and fresh views on shared transportation systems. “I frequently visit the Beijing headquarters of Didi Chuxing, China’s largest ride-hailing platform,” he says. “By actively communicating and interacting with professionals who are exploring and implementing new ideas for various shared transportation systems, I obtain managerial and industry insights that may be relevant to the Singapore context.”
From a big-picture standpoint, Professor Wang notes that one of true benefits of shared transportation systems may actually lie in their ability to bring about a change in Singaporeans’ mindsets towards private vehicle ownership.
Effective carpool systems such as GrabShare and UberPOOL help commuters get accustomed to sharing a personalised transportation service with fellow wayfarers. “With convenient and efficient sharing mechanisms to provide high-quality transportation services, the prevalent desire to own a car exclusively could gradually decline,” he adds. “If citizens still choose to own a car, they may opt to own it with others, thereby sharing not only the right to use it, but also the expenses of parking and repairs.”
As shared transportation systems become increasingly common in Singapore and across the world, there will be much to learn about this new wave in urban mobility, says Professor Wang.
“How drivers and passengers interact in a sharing platform, how they react to prices and wages in different formats, and how we can design high-quality mechanisms to improve system efficiency by considering human behaviour—these are important questions that still need to be answered,” he says.

Will cycle sharing in India blaze its own trail compared to the rest of the world?.
Cycle sharing in its current avatar of technology-enabled, dockless bicycles is just 24 months old. Never in human history has a business model gone from zero customers to hundreds of million in just two years.
The pace and breakneck growth has been staggering to say the least. Unlike many of the other large internet consumer trends of the past two decades, dockless cycle sharing emerged firmly from the Chinese tech orbit and not the American one.  In many ways, China had the perfect storm for cycle sharing to take off.
On one hand, you have the dominating ride-sharing leviathan Didi, which has captured Chinese hearts and minds with its other-worldly scale across 100+ Chinese cities. On the other, you have the payment apps from WeChat and Alibaba that have already reached near saturation across Chinese metros in terms of mobile wallet penetration.


Combining a propensity for ubiquitous cashless payments with a newfound tendency to book urban transport from a smartphone made a very potent combination in the Chinese market.
This was quite enough to form a strong habit forming behaviour when you then also consider the hyper locale, uber convenient distribution strategy of cycle sharing players in China. Combined with relatively strong public-sector infrastructure for cycling made it all but certain that a habit forming behaviour would emerge to support cycle sharing in China.
Across Chinese cities, the cycle-sharing companies work very closely with the local governments to create a sustained model for placing cycles in convenient access points across cities. In many cases, the cycle-sharing company will sign an MOU with the local government to ensure that space is clearly defined.
This gives more certainty to both the operator and the user. This is one of the key reasons why the Chinese cycle-sharing model has scaled so quickly. With siting considerations largely taken care from the government side (basically had been until very recently park-wherever-you-want within a very large predefined area), it became fairly straight forward and formulaic in terms of scaling. More capital equals more cycles in more places, which translates to more users and more revenue.

Sounds like a virtuous circle of life. Until it isn’t. Many of the Chinese operators have been hit hard from a lack of true technology investment in their cycles, thereby leaving their assets exposed to theft and customer misuse. Only now are large scale operators starting to mend their ways at scale and are beginning to implement more robust measures.
With this rundown of China basically complete, let’s see how it stacks up against other markets.
In the US and Europe, the pace of the dockless cycle sharing rollout has been far more gradual and more tech-enabled, with smart locking and GPS tracking from the beginning. In part due to the stronger government restrictions around public parking, both domestic and foreign operators have trodden slowly when it comes to adding supply for fear of alienating the municipal government.
Moreover, the seamlessly integrated mobile payment infrastructure is just not at the same level in the US and Europe as it’s in China. Given this fact, there’s just slightly more friction in the dockless model outside China.  Perhaps, more importantly for the US and Europe, strong mobility alternatives to cycle sharing exist.
In Europe, for instance, cities are very compact given the sometimes near ancient layouts. This makes walking very convenient. Moreover, many of these cities have very stellar (both cheap and convenient) metro and tram networks that make the last-mile connectivity extremely strong, thereby making cycling a bit less appealing overall.
In China, the cities are so vast and sprawling that even with strong relative metro coverage, last mile connectivity still remains a challenge for people. This is where cycle sharing steps in and plays a strong role.
In the US, on the other hand, cycle sharing faces different challenges. Given car ownership stands close to 100 percent of the adult population in most cities (New York is a strong exception given density levels), cycle sharing inherently is less popular. Outside 4-5 cities in the US, the mass transit infrastructure is quite weak, and the distances are very far.
This makes a car a more appealing option (even two-wheelers or scooters aren’t very popular in US for this reason).  In most US cities, the last mile is simply too far for cycle sharing to achieve major critical mass like in China. The jury is still out whether major cities can make do with more than a few thousand.
Now, over to India. For decades, urban planners have marvelled at the density and chaos found across most Indian cities.

In most instances, the cities were quite haphazardly planned (if at all). As such, basic road and footpath infrastructure that’s naturally present in Europe, the US, or China isn’t found in most Indian cities. With this reality in mind, cycle sharing has its own set of challenges and opportunities.
In terms of baseline road and cycle path infrastructure, India certainly doesn’t hold a candle to any other parts of the globe. This does offer up an impediment for the hyper scale witnessed in other markets. On the other hand, the government has vowed to aggressively expand this infrastructure over the next 2-3 years, so this difference may very well fade away very soon.
Moreover, the frenetic urban pace coupled with the haphazard last-mile connectivity creates a unique opportunity for Indian cycle sharing compared to other countries.  In many instances, the cycle provides a very nimble option for individuals to bypass heavy traffic and save commute time.
Coupled with the fact that cycles are incredibly cheap in India relative to other markets does make a compelling value proposition for several cohorts of individuals.
Cycle parking in Indian cities is another major difference between the US, Europe, and China. In all these markets, the government works closely with cycle-sharing operators to define space for the dockless cycles to be placed.
This process has yet to unfold in India. As seen in many other mobility-related business in India, it’s more likely that operators will leverage a more private sector focussed siting model compared to the more typical public private partnership approach.
Over time, government may very well catch up in India and it might be possible to witness a hybrid approach.  This would ultimately help facilitate more scale up across the board.
While India is quite far apart from China as it relates to basic road+ cycle infrastructure and public parking arrangements, it is very similar to China in one very important way: a strong mobile payment backbone.
While it’s still not nearly as ubiquitous as China in terms of market penetration, players like Paytm, Mobikwik, and Jio Money are all aggressively carving out parts of the market. Layer on top of this development the government’s own UPI efforts with apps like BHIM and it’s clear that there’s real momentum in the space.
This trend is likely to only intensify over the next 12 months, thereby making cycle sharing even easier to adopt at scale across not only Tier I Indian cities, but also Tier II and III towns.
In India, Ola and Uber have aggressively expanded over the last few years and individuals are now extremely comfortable with leveraging mobile for various types of urban mobility. Two-wheeler taxis and scooter rental are also starting to emerge in India as viable mobility options and this should help make it easier for individuals to acclimatise to cycle sharing.
Overall, cycle sharing in India will blaze its own trail compared to the rest of the world. Like with car-sharing and ride-sharing before it, India has created a new paradigm that’s highly customised for the local ground reality.
Both mobility models are currently thriving on the subcontinent.  Expect nothing different as cycle sharing explodes in the coming months and years.

Public transit officials in cities across the United States are trying to find ways for ride sharing to complement existing public transit options or those in the development pipeline, while others worry that ride sharing could replace public transit altogether. That shift is already starting.
A recent survey conducted by the University of California, Davis found that ride sharing services resulted in a six percent reduction in Americans’ use of bus systems and a three percent reduction in Americans’ usage of light rail services.
Studies of New York and other cities suggest that Uber, Lyft, and other app-based car services are increasing congestion and air pollution by facilitating a shift away from mass transit.
But some independent-thinking cities are offering on-demand ride sharing as an alternative to high-cost rapid transit.

One of the first in the United States is Arlington, Texas, a growing city of 380,000 people located between Dallas and Fort Worth.
Last December, in partnership with the Via rideshare service, Arlington began a pilot program supported by the Arlington City Council and the citizen-led Transportation Advisory Committee.
The rideshare pilot replaced the Metro Arlington Xpress commuter bus line, which was taken out of service on December 31, 2017.
The Via service area initially covers downtown Arlington and the City’s Cultural Arts District, the University of Texas at Arlington, the Entertainment District, and the area around Arlington Memorial Hospital. Summer expansion plans call for coverage of the airport, commuter train stations and major retail destinations.
Customers can book a seat in a six-passenger Mercedes-Benz van through the Via app or by phone, and Via’s sophisticated technology can match them with others going their way in a kind of riadesharing car pool. Wheelchair accessible vehicles are available. Rides are $3 per trip.
The contract is for one year, with four one-year renewal options. The City of Arlington will pick up one-third of the pilot project’s cost, about $322,500, with the rest coming from the Federal Transit Administration.
Data collected through the rideshare pilot will help shape the City Council’s future transport planning decisions.

“We are at the beginning of an exciting transportation technology revolution,” said Mayor Jeff Williams. “Arlington’s Via Rideshare Pilot Program is the latest example of our city’s willingness to explore innovative transportation technology solutions for our residents, employees, students and visitors.”
Arlington also will be a test city for self-driving cars. The U.S. Department of Transportation has named Texas a national Automated Vehicle Proving Ground for the testing of connected and automated vehicle technologies.
Automated vehicles aren’t the only type of innovative transportation technology being explored in Arlington.
In January, the city announced a data-sharing partnership with Waze, the free, real-time crowd-sourced traffic and navigation app powered by the world’s largest community of drivers.
Designed as a free, two-way data share of publicly available traffic information, the Connected Citizens Program promotes greater efficiency, deeper insights and safer roads for the drivers of Arlington along with more than 100 other partners around the world.

In Surry Hills in inner-Sydney recently, real estate agent Paul Langsam has made a virtue out of a loft apartment’s lack of parking.
“There was a dedicated share-car space across the street, so we used that in our marketing,’’ the Double Bay Raine and Horne agent says. “With the onset of share cars and better public transport buyers are much more open to properties without parking.’’
Twenty years ago, inner city properties without a car space had a smaller pool of buyers to draw on but the confluence of increased environmental consciousness, local councils’ push to reduce cars and on-street parking and the impact of car-share schemes has changed the way buyers – in particular, younger buyers – look at property.
“It’s a demographic change,’’ says Lisa Marquette, a property economist with architectural studio Katsieris Origami which designs residential and property developments around Australia.
“Older people still see a car park as important but younger buyers and renters much less so.
”We’re seeing apartment developments around the country without car parking and that has been driven by councils in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne trying to reduce car usage, while Brisbane and Sydney are retro-fitting their transport networks and moving to light rail.
“Students and young professionals are comfortable using public transport and bikes. If they need to go to Ikea or visit their parents, they use a share car.”
But Marquette says this change is only evident in the inner cities and a car park is still important once you’re out of the inner zones.
She says a car park will always add value to a property, simply because it means more land size. Also, if you don’t use it you can offset the mortgage by renting it out.
But for first time buyers and those investing in one-bedroom or studio apartments, this trend reflects a significant mindshift.
As we move away from the American freeway-based town-planning model of the 1970s to the European and Asian model of better public transport and light rail, the emotional attachment to a car space is declining. For instance, a green space might become more of a selling point than a car spot.
“Local governments have a huge role to play in this change as they make philosophical decisions to reduce traffic and car parking,’’ Marquette says.
“If all apartments had balconies then it would seem strange if an apartment didn’t have a balcony, so when more and more apartments don’t have car parking it won’t seem as important or significant.’’

So if you have a town house with a car park beneath your living space, should you ditch it and turn it into another bedroom if local regulations permit?
“Will a two-bedroom apartment with no parking be more valuable than a one-bedroom with one parking space?’’ asks Langsam. “That’s a difficult one to answer as it depends on the attractions of the property itself and its access to public transport.’’
Marquette says that those who live in inner city cottages with rear parking are in the best position as they can convert to the car space to outdoor living but when they come to sell, have the advantage of attracting buyers who value a car park.
One thing is clear however, as driving becomes more time consuming and stressful in the inner city and street parks become more costly, the importance of a car space is becoming less front of mind when it comes to selling.

Scooti is a new ride-sharing service coming to Melbourne this April. Its point of difference in a crowded market? Passengers will be getting around on two wheels instead of four – the service uses scooters instead of cars.
CEO Cameron Nadi describes himself as a motoring enthusiast, and has been riding bikes since his teens. He was inspired by ride-sharing services like Go-Jek in Southeast Asia (which also focuses on scooters), and believes Scooti will bring a sense of adventure to his customer’s commute.
“More and more Australians are going to Southeast Asia, to Europe, for holidays and getting on the back of scooters and loving it. So we’re bringing that here, we’re making errands an adventure.


“We want the best scooter drivers who are passionate about scooter culture, and who really want to … help commuters get to their destinations a lot quicker,” he says.
In 2015 lane filtering was legalised in Victoria, enabling motorcyclists to ride between lanes of traffic at a speed of 30km/h or less, when safe to do so. Nadi plans on taking advantage of the rule change with Scooti.
“We’re saving significant time, when you’ve got that stand-still traffic that everyone dreads, scooters can just slice right through,” he says.



He believes Scooti will provide Melburnians with an innovative alternative to car ride-sharing services and taxis.
“You see all these scooters zipping past going through traffic with a spare seat – we want to fill that seat.”
Scooti provides users with a helmet and a hairnet for hygiene reasons, as well as gloves and a poncho for unpredictable Melbourne weather. At the moment the ponchos and hairnets are disposable, but the team is looking into more durable options for regular users.
Users have to download the app to ride, entering both their pick-up location and destination. Like Uber the system is cashless, with payments being processed through the app.
There’ll also be a women-only service, similar to the female-oriented ride-share service Shebah, which launched last year.
“Some of our passengers may want to get on the back with a female, and vice versa, some female drivers only want female passengers,” says Nadi.
Potential drivers can apply through the Scooti website or app. Successful applicants must provide documentation such as their license, registration, insurance details, a police check and safe-driving record. They must also take a practical test to display their bike handling skills. Drivers are also instructed to refuse service to passengers who’ve had too much to drink.
While drivers are encouraged to have their own scooter, Scooti has a small fleet of carbon-neutral Fonzarelli electric scooters. Several drivers have already been recruited, and Nadi aims to have over 100 by the launch in mid-April.
Scooti is one of many new ride-sharing services to pop up in Melbourne, with Taxify, Oiii and Ola all having launched in the last few months.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are an important part of how we will reduce climate-changing emissions, air pollution, and petroleum consumption.
Are they the only way we will cut pollution from personal transportation? Of course not. EVs are critical, but we’ll also need to be smart about using urban design, transit, and shared mobility to reduce the amount of driving from all vehicles.
However, a recent U.S. News & World Report article puts EVs in a false competition with these other strategies, while also repeating myths about the environmental impacts of EVs.

EVs reduce emissions now
On average, EVs on the road today produce less global warming emissions than the average new gasoline car.
The emissions do depend on where in the U.S. the EV is used, because electric power generation comes from different sources depending on the region.
Because many of the EVs have been sold in regions with cleaner power (like California), the EVs being used today are, on average, responsible for fewer emissions than any gasoline-powered car.
Based on sales through 2016, the using the average EV is responsible for global warming emissions equal to that of a 73 MPG gasoline car.

EVs are still responsible for fewer global warming emissions, even when you consider the additional energy and materials needed to manufacture the batteries that power EVs.
We found that these extra emissions are offset quickly by savings during use; on average after 6 to 18 months of use.
There are also other concerns mentioned in passing in the U.S. News article, such as the impact of mining for battery raw materials. But the negative impacts from raw material extraction are largely due to lax regulations and can be addressed through better policy and corporate responsibility.
For components like cobalt and rare earth metals, all high-tech consumer product companies need to ensure that they have environmentally responsible supply chains that also protect the rights and health of those impacted by mining.
This is as true for Apple and Samsung as it is for EV manufacturers.
There have been positive developments from batteries suppliers and technology companies, but they can and should do more to ensure responsible battery production.
At the same time we also need to consider the negative impacts of gasoline production, from human rights abuses to massive environmental disasters during oil extraction, to the unavoidable air pollution damage from refining and burning gasoline in our cars. All our personal transportation fuels – gasoline, diesel, biofuels, or electricity – can be cleaner if fuel producers are held accountable to reduce their pollution.
Moving to EVs faster will help to reduce emissions even more
Another attack on EVs in the U.S. News article is that EVs only make up a small fraction of the vehicles on the country’s roads today.
This is true, but is not a reason to turn back. The first mass-market EVs only went on sale at the end of 2010. From those two models (Chevrolet Volt and Nissan LEAF), the market has now grown to some 30 EV models available today. However, many of these EVs are not sold nationwide and are not marketed effectively.
In one notable case, Fiat Chrysler has decided to not even let customers outside of California know that it’s new minivan comes in a plug-in version.
Still, EV sales are increasing and hitting new milestones, especially in places with strong regulations and incentive programs like California where manufacturers have also placed much more effort to sell EVs (when compared to the rest of the U.S.)
In the first quarter of 2017, EV sales in California were nearly 5 percent of all new car sales and for some manufacturers were much higher. For example, General Motors’ Chevrolet brand had plug-in cars make up over 15 percent of all new sales in the first 3 months of 2017.
Having more options for new car buyers to pick a plug-in car will only help make the market grow. And it’s important for the market to grow as quickly as possible. Because cars often stay on the road more than a decade, it’s critical to speed up the transition from petroleum to electricity.
The future is electric, but also needs shared transportation
The future of driving is electric. It’s not just our opinion at UCS, both car companies and governments realize that EVs are the future.
CEOs of Ford and  VW have gone on record with predictions of high volume EV sales. And France, Norway, and India are among the countries that have set impressive goals to transition to EVs.
But EVs alone aren’t enough to meet our climate goals. It’s important to also reduce the impact from transportation by reducing the number of miles we drive, even from electric cars.
Shared transportation, whether via transit, carpools, or new ridesharing services, will also be important to make significant reductions in pollution. But this is in no way in competition with EVs. Instead, EVs are complementary to many of these shared transportation options.

Uber users in Los Angeles will have a new way to hail a ride, starting today. The company’s Express Pool service, piloted last year in San Francisco and Boston, is now available to customers in Los Angeles.
The Express Pool system allows customers to trade the convenience of being picked up wherever they are for a more “consistent experience,” says Ethan Stock, director of product for Uber. To make trips more efficient, the app will often ask users to walk to a set destination so that drivers don’t have to go too far out of their way to find them.

That makes it even more comparable to traditional public transit than Uber’s Pool service, which launched in 2014 and offers users the opportunity to save on the cost of a ride by picking up other passengers along the way to their destination.
The new option is designed to iron out some of the wrinkles in the Pool system, which has been criticizedby drivers and riders alike for its unpredictable matchmaking system, which often leads to long detours and circuitous pickup route.S





By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.





Users may also have to exercise a bit of patience when ordering a ride using Express Pool. Stock says passengers can expect to wait for 1 to 2 minutes while the app pairs them with other riders traveling along a similar route.
Riders will get a significant discount by using the Express Pool option. Uber estimates that trips with the new system will be around half the price of a Pool ride and up to 75 percent less than the conventional UberX option, in which just one passenger hails a ride to a single destination.
The new system sounds quite similar to a “microtransit” program that Metro wants to create through a public-private partnership.
Meant to give system riders more flexible service—as well as a new way to travel to and from larger transit stops—Metro’s program would also rely on smartphone technology and would allow passengers to get picked up along flexible routes that could change depending on rider demand.
Cities around the country have started experimenting with microtransit systems to supplement rail and bus networks that are harder to rework and customize on the fly. In the small city of Altamonte Springs, Florida, the local government is even subsidizing Uber to provide rides to the local light rail station.
In a 2015 blog post, transit consultant Jarrett Walker suggested that microtransit services could provide a valuable supplement to conventional public transportation networks—if providers are willing to cooperate with, rather than compete against, local transit agencies.
Stock says Uber’s new service will help transit agencies by giving riders easier access to transit hubs and that the company has already coordinated with Cincinnati on a possible partnership.
Asked whether the company had contacted Metro about the new service in Los Angeles and how it could fit in with the agency’s transit goals, Uber spokesperson Stephanie Sedlak tells Curbed that the company has already seen riders using the Pool option to get to and from stations in Los Angeles.
“We commend Metro’s continued commitment to ensuring Angelenos have access to multiple and complementary modes of shared transportation solutions,” Sedlak said.
Metro spokesperson Dave Sotero says the agency was not aware of the new Express Pool option.

Public transit officials in cities across the United States are trying to find ways for ride sharing to complement existing public transit options or those in the development pipeline, while others worry that ride sharing could replace public transit altogether. That shift is already starting.
A recent survey conducted by the University of California, Davis found that ride sharing services resulted in a six percent reduction in Americans’ use of bus systems and a three percent reduction in Americans’ usage of light rail services.
Studies of New York and other cities suggest that Uber, Lyft, and other app-based car services are increasing congestion and air pollution by facilitating a shift away from mass transit.
But some independent-thinking cities are offering on-demand ride sharing as an alternative to high-cost rapid transit.

One of the first in the United States is Arlington, Texas, a growing city of 380,000 people located between Dallas and Fort Worth.
Last December, in partnership with the Via rideshare service, Arlington began a pilot program supported by the Arlington City Council and the citizen-led Transportation Advisory Committee.
The rideshare pilot replaced the Metro Arlington Xpress commuter bus line, which was taken out of service on December 31, 2017.
The Via service area initially covers downtown Arlington and the City’s Cultural Arts District, the University of Texas at Arlington, the Entertainment District, and the area around Arlington Memorial Hospital. Summer expansion plans call for coverage of the airport, commuter train stations and major retail destinations.
Customers can book a seat in a six-passenger Mercedes-Benz van through the Via app or by phone, and Via’s sophisticated technology can match them with others going their way in a kind of riadesharing car pool. Wheelchair accessible vehicles are available. Rides are $3 per trip.
The contract is for one year, with four one-year renewal options. The City of Arlington will pick up one-third of the pilot project’s cost, about $322,500, with the rest coming from the Federal Transit Administration.
Data collected through the rideshare pilot will help shape the City Council’s future transport planning decisions.

“We are at the beginning of an exciting transportation technology revolution,” said Mayor Jeff Williams. “Arlington’s Via Rideshare Pilot Program is the latest example of our city’s willingness to explore innovative transportation technology solutions for our residents, employees, students and visitors.”
Arlington also will be a test city for self-driving cars. The U.S. Department of Transportation has named Texas a national Automated Vehicle Proving Ground for the testing of connected and automated vehicle technologies.
Automated vehicles aren’t the only type of innovative transportation technology being explored in Arlington.
In January, the city announced a data-sharing partnership with Waze, the free, real-time crowd-sourced traffic and navigation app powered by the world’s largest community of drivers.
Designed as a free, two-way data share of publicly available traffic information, the Connected Citizens Program promotes greater efficiency, deeper insights and safer roads for the drivers of Arlington along with more than 100 other partners around the world.

Students who want to learn more about The Ohio State University’s role as a smart campus in the heart of a smart city recently filled a classroom to hear from the leaders of the effort.
Smart Campus, a student organization partnering with the university’s Center for Automotive Research, hosted leaders from the city of Columbus, Smart Columbus, CAR, the university’s Technology Commercialization Office and the Transportation Research Center this month in Scott Laboratory.
“We have a campus that rivals in size some of the smaller cities in the nation. With that, we have the unique opportunity to operate in a microcosm where we can test and find solutions that can then be extended to cities around the nation,” said Cameron Luther, co-founder of Smart Campus.
The Smart Campus organization is working to help students from across the university find ways to collaborate with the Smart Columbus initiative and engage in campus projects tied to a connected campus.
In 2016, Columbus won the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Smart City Challenge, beating out 77 cities. The win secured $40 million in grants from the federal government and another $10 million from Vulcan Inc. Ohio State is the lead researcher on the project.
While the initiative, and the grant money tied to it, lasts for only a limited time, research at Ohio State will continue to make Columbus a smarter city.
“The reality is, here at Ohio State, because of the awesome faculty, staff and students, we’ve been really engaging in smart cities research the entire time depending on which definition we use,” said Courtney Falato, Smart Cites relationship director at Ohio State.
Falato said automotive research and connected devices are only part of what it means to be a smart city. She referred to a quote that put the research in context.
“So even though smart seems to be synonymous with technology, certainly it goes way beyond technology. What does it accomplish and how does it improve the lives of citizens?” Falato said.

Currently, Smart Columbus projects are focused on using technology to improve the Columbus community. One effort includes developing a common payment system for transportation so people across the economic spectrum can take advantage of public transportation, ride sharing or other services. Another is working to develop a way to provide more flexible and reliable transportation to expectant mothers using Medicaid-based services.
“(Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther) believes that transportation and mobility is the great equalizer of the 21st century,” said Brandi Braun, deputy innovation officer for Columbus. “We want to ensure that we approach smart mobility and smart city technologies in a way where we are not widening the gap between Columbus’ haves and have-nots.”
Jordan Davis, director of Smart Columbus at the Columbus Partnership, told students that future advances in technology should lead to reduced congestion and a cleaner environment. It will also simplify mundane tasks like shopping for groceries or picking up dry cleaning.
“I think of mobility as a service in its simplest form. How can we use the sharing economy and how can we use technology to make mobility work for them,” Davis said.
Luther encouraged his peers to become active in the opportunities offered by the Smart Campus program.
“We’re right in the center of an amazing moment,” he said. “I really encourage all of you in the room that are here to take that opportunity by the horns.”

Taxi companies across Japan are working with ride-hailing apps to enhance efficiency, improve customer convenience, and to keep up with global changes in the market.
Sony Corp. and six major taxi firms including the Tokyo-based Checker Cab Group announced on Feb. 20 that they were collaborating on the development of a ride-hailing service. 
The service will makes use of Sony’s artificial intelligence (AI) technology, and is expected to reduce passenger waiting times and the time it takes drivers to find customers by assessing demand based on such factors as the weather. The companies plan to unveil a smartphone app in autumn, with further plans to provide the app to other taxi companies in the future.
Daiichi Kotsu Sangyo Co., based in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka Prefecture, has similarly started talks with both American firm Uber Technologies and Chinese company Didi Chuxing about collaborating on a taxi-hailing service.
Uber, a global ride-sharing powerhouse, was initially looking to deliver a similar service in Japan, but uncertainty about when a current domestic ban on ride-sharing will be lifted has shifted the firm’s attention to taxi-hailing technology. The American company has said it is considering working with other Japanese taxi firms, claiming that its ride-sharing knowledge gained from working in more than 70 countries is its forte, enabling it to operate in numerous languages.

On Feb. 8, Nihon Kotsu Co. announced its plan to form a capital alliance with Toyota Motor Corp.
Its popular ride-hailing app has already been downloaded 4 million times, giving the firm the edge over its competitors, and it is looking to improve further, making use of AI.
The number of taxi users has continued to decline in recent years, with 1.47 billion rides counted in fiscal 2015 — a drop of about 40 percent compared to fiscal 2005 — and taxi companies are increasingly fearful that people will demand that the domestic ban on ride-sharing be lifted. This has promoted them to come up with ways to improve customer convenience.
The taxi industry kicked off a “ride-sharing taxi” experiment on Jan. 24, as a preemptive measure against regular ride-sharing. However, low usage and a lack of awareness have hindered progress of the experiment.
“A ride-sharing taxi could not be found for you.” This was the message received on a weekday in late February during a Mainichi Shimbun attempt to find a ride-sharing taxi with the Nihon Kotsu app.
The app searches for people going in the same direction as a given taxi, and the seeker can board the vehicle if a suitable vehicle is located. According to Japan Taxi Co., which oversees management of the app, “There are lots of users at night.” However, a Mainichi attempt to find a ride-sharing taxi at night was also unsuccessful.
The main selling point of ride-sharing is that fares are 20 to 40 percent cheaper than when riding alone.
According to Nihon Kotsu and Daiwa Motor Transportation Co., which have been taking part in the experiment, feedback from customers who have managed to get on ride-share taxis has been favorable, with Nihon Kotsu saying, “It’s been popular due to the low fares.”
Neither company has released data on the number of users, but according to Daiwa Motor, “The number of users has not been high.” As a result, Nihon Kotsu intends to improve its app, by introducing real-time notifications on people looking to share a ride, and where they are located.
According to a source in the taxi industry, Daiwa Motor Transportation, which pre-arranges ride-sharing pick-up points, raised the number of pick-up points from 30 to 50 in a bid to increase customer use.
Industry experts say that the reason for sparse customer usage of ride-share taxis is due to low awareness about such services and the reluctance of many people to ride with strangers.

Ride-sharing service is no longer just a pipe dream in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, as people can now use mobile apps to easily get a motorbike delivered to their doorstep in minutes.
A handful of companies have already started app-based on-demand motorcycle ride-sharing services in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country, which are known for inadequate road systems and public transport services.
In Dhaka, one of the most densely populated cities in the world with a population of about 15 million, a substantial portion of the day’s working hours are wasted on the streets due to traffic jams, which indirectly adversely impacts the country’s economy.
Against this backdrop, app-based motorcycle ride-sharing service providers like Pathao have proved to be quite popular as they take users to their destinations by threading through the heavy traffic.
Rizwan Ahmed Rafi works in a private company. He regularly rides a motorbike and can swiftly skim through traffic.
“My office is located at Banani in Dhaka. Every day I have to come to the office and in the past it was very difficult to get here,” he said.
“I had to use three or four different modes of transport for just one journey. I’d use buses and rickshaws. Sometimes it was unbelievably difficult,” he added.
He said the buses were so crowded and slow due to the heavy traffic that it almost made no sense catching one at all.
“Thankfully, the app Pathao has made my commute to work far more easy these days and along with other uses we can be far more productive at work, because we can save so much time that was once wasted stuck in traffic,” Rafi said.
He added that upon sending a request via the app just before leaving home or his office, a rider would arrive and swiftly drop him off at his desired location.
“There are no problems with the fees as the service is relatively inexpensive. As well as being a more efficient worker I can also spend more time with my family. It’s certainly a win-win,” he said.
For rider Asif Ahmed, the service created an opportunity for him to earn some extra money before and after office hours.
Ahmed likes to work as a rider as he can work according to his own schedule.
“I am a private service provider. Every day, I share a ride on the way to the office and on the way back from the office. By working this way I earn 15,000 taka (about 180 U.S. dollars) a month,” he said.

For Sabnaz Afroz, a female rider who began to work as a rider in 2017, such a service came as a big blessing.
“This is because when I was a student in Dhaka, I had a lot of problems in earning money for my studies,” she said, adding that, “it helped me a lot as a source of income.”
“I’ve finished my degree and I am now studying for my master’s without having to worry too much about money,” she said.
Operators said the ride-sharing services are fast-gaining popularity in urban areas with the rise of both users and riders day by day.
Riaz Uddin Ahamad, director and head of rider acquisition at Pathao, said app-based ride-sharing services have not merely benefited the riders and their users but also the entire motorbike industry.
He said motorbike traders are benefitting from the growing popularity of the services.
“So far I understand the demand for motorbikes, especially those from China, are on the rise in Bangladesh. Chinese companies like Lifan are now exporting more products to Bangladesh,” he said, adding that “due to the reasonable prices of Chinese motorbikes, our younger generations can better afford to buy them.”
“And with their Chinese motorbikes they can engage themselves with the app-based on-demand motorcycle ride sharing services,” said Ahamad.

Every 25 seconds or so, someone loses their life in a traffic accident somewhere in the world. 1.2 million traffic fatalities take place every year and about 90 % of these accidents happen due to human error. Around one-third of the traffic congestion in cities is caused by people looking for parking spots.
These are just some of the massive problems the world is facing today due to the rapid pace of urbanisation. With every passing day, more and more people around the globe are moving to cities in hope of economic development.
Such is the pace of this movement that by 2050, the number of people living in large cities will increase two-folds to more than six billion. With limited space for expansion and most megacities already struggling with the present population, the future seems quite challenging.
One of the areas to be significantly affected by this people movement is mobility. Congestion will become worse, air quality will deteriorate further, the number of accidents will go up and stress levels will go even higher.
All this is going to have an adverse effect on the society and our future generations. In the US alone, drivers in 10 cities with the densest traffic spent around 42 hours in traffic jams, resulting in a loss of $ 121 billion in time and fuel!

The only solution to this problem is to have a smart mobility system, which can interact with people, vehicles, and infrastructure, thereby helping avoid the above-mentioned problems. Bosch recently conducted the Mobility Experience 2017 in Boxberg, Germany, where it showcased various technologies that can help improve the quality of life in cities.
Smart & Autonomous
The key areas that will transform urban mobility include autonomous driving, small electric cars, and ride-sharing. While it may seem that some of these solutions may not be fit for India right now, the reality is quite different.
The future of driving is going to be connected and assisted, which means that in a couple of decades we might just stop driving altogether. This may sound disappointing but in the interest of safety, this seems to be the right path.

Bosch is presently working on a number of assistance systems that can reduce the stress for drivers and enhance safety. The need for such technologies is higher in India since 15 to 35 deaths occur for every 100,000 road users in Jaipur, compared to the 3 to 5 deaths in Berlin and Tokyo.
One of the systems that I found particularly interesting and suitable for India was the Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), which can detect an imminent collision and apply brakes automatically, avoiding the accident or limiting the damage.
The system developed by Bosch can also detect cyclists/ people in fog or conditions with limited visibility. This system could save many lives, especially in the Northern India, which gets enveloped in blinding fog during winter, leading to a higher rate of accidents.

Automated driving was one the highlights of the event and the vehicle we witnessed it in was based on a Tesla Model S. Around 1.3 km of cable, 1,400 hours of work and 50 new components lend the car with a high level of autonomous capability in the real world.
A human-machine interface (HMI) concept developed by Bosch can identify its drivers and automatically load the appropriate user profile. The HMI informs the driver when a stretch of the road is available for automated driving.
In order to ensure that drivers do not fall asleep when the vehicle is driving on its own an interior camera continuously monitors the driver’s eye movements. While experiencing this vehicle, the driver shut his eyes and quickly the system gave out audio warnings.
When the driver did not respond, the car looked for the nearest possible safe spot to stop and parked itself there. In real-world, the car in such case can connect with emergency services as such a situation could mean the driver is facing some medical emergency. Having a simpler form of this system could play a great role in making highways safer for India as it might be able to alert drivers of imminent risks and avoid accidents.

Connected parking is one more technology that makes great sense for India. Cars that can not only park themselves but can also communicate with other cars and infrastructure to find out parking spaces will have a tremendous positive impact on the traffic flow.
This will be in addition to the time and effort it will help save for people. There are already cars costing around Rs 15 lakh that can park themselves so it’s only a matter of time before suppliers such as Bosch achieve higher economies of scale and trickle the technology down to smaller cars.
Electric Cars
By now it’s clear that electric cars are the future and Bosch, being the world’s largest automotive supplier is working on many technologies that are pushing the boundaries of efficiency and range. Small electric vehicles are a focus area for Bosch and understandably so as they make great sense for congested cities.
These also include electric two-wheelers as around 100 million light electric vehicles will be sold globally by 2020. These also make great sense for India but someone needs to figure out the cost part, which continues to be high as of now.

Electric two-wheelers in India use lead-acid batteries right now and hence have range and performance issues. Lithium-ion batteries with an integrated and smart system as shown by Bosch can greatly enhance the capability of such scooters but would push the cost further up. This is the part where vehicle makers and suppliers need to work in tandem with the Government so that the masses see enough appeal in electric two-wheelers.
The systems shown by Bosch though are scalable, which makes it possible to produce different versions quickly at a low-cost for vehicle manufacturers.

For the growth of autonomous driving too, small electric cars seem to be a perfect fit. Ride-sharing will gain popularity over the next few years and small electric cars can easily be used for this purpos
Their small size will make it easier to navigate congested streets and lower cost will quicken adoption by operators or city authorities. This may seem far but some cities in Europe could have an autonomous ride-sharing service by 2025 or sooner.
Connectivity, the backbone for future mobility
While we’ve gone through autonomous cars and electric vehicles by now, the most critical part for these vehicles to operate as desired is connectivity. Even our regular cars these days are well-connected to our smartphone.
Autonomous cars, however, will need to be connected with almost everything in the environment around them including other vehicles, traffic signals, emergency services and more.
Autonomous cars will need to process a gigantic amount of data to operate safely, as high as one gigabyte every second! This data itself will hold tremendous value since comp
anies will be able to collate this data to make systems more powerful or draw patterns from certain events to chart out a more efficient way of functioning.

There are great benefits of autonomous technology apart from the usual ones we are mostly aware of. As everything around us goes digital connected cars will gain importance as they’ll be able to communicate with appliances in your home as well.
Imagine being driven back from work and as you approach your home, the air-conditioning is switched on to cool down the rooms and the TV already starts playing your favourite sport. These possibilities are a fraction of the potential autonomous driving holds for the future.

There is a challenge though, especially for India for all this connectivity to work and that is the availability of internet. While internet availability in developed countries is good, India still has a long way to go before our infrastructure can support autonomous driving.
Traffic sense is another major issue and will take a fair bit of time to improve. Smaller autonomous systems then are going to be the bridge between the present and future mobility for countries such as India for now.
Conclusion
Technology is developing rapidly today and future mobility is going to be much smarter, efficient and safer than the present. The shift to autonomous cars is happening quicker than we can imagine and certain countries such as Germany, Sweden, Japan and the US are leading this shift.
As norms across the world demand lower emissions and higher safety, autonomous cars with electric powertrains will witness mass adoption, primarily in the car-sharing model and not the personal ownership model.

From India’s perspective, fully-autonomous driving might still be a long way off but parts of it and certain systems such as AEB hold immense potential to increase safety and the flow of traffic.
There are other systems too such as a lane guidance system that can work even in the absence of lane marking.There were more technologies that we were shown and made to experience but in the interest of time and space let’s keep it limited to the future of driving in this article.
While technology will continue to evolve at a rapid pace, I feel a bit sad as future cars will not be as engaging and exciting to drive as the present ones. The way we associate cars with the character of a person will be lost as self-driving cars with standard functions will take over.
However, a part of me feels happy too since millions of lives will be saved and billions will spend lesser time in traffic while breathing cleaner air.

According to the German Car Sharing Association, more than 1.7 million people in Germany are registered with providers such as market leader car2go.
Mercedes me is now extending its services to include private car sharing: the Mercedes me app Car Sharing allows A‑Class drivers to share their vehicle with a specified group of users. Friends, family members or colleagues can then easily book the A‑Class for a fixed period of time.



The authorized user opens the vehicle using the app and by means of the Mercedes me communication module installed in the vehicle. The A‑Class is started with the vehicle key, which is left in the car and temporary use of which is likewise enabled over the air by Mercedes me.
When returning the vehicle, the driver puts the key back in the car and closes the car with the app, thereby bringing the sharing period to an end. The vehicle key in the car can be used only during the sharing period.
The car can also be contactlessly opened, closed and started by means of Near Field Communication (NFC).
This technology is used by the Digital Vehicle Key. The new A‑Class is now also available in Germany with a Digital Vehicle Key Sticker with a built-in NFC controller. This means that the use of the Digital Vehicle Key no longer requires an NFC-capable smartphone.
First launched in the E‑Class, the Digital Vehicle Key is now available as an optional extra ex-works for a number of model series. However, not every smartphone has an NFC interface that complies with Mercedes-Benz’s security standards.
For the new A‑Class, therefore, there is now a Digital Vehicle Key Sticker with a built-in microcontroller. Customers can order this sticker from the Mercedes me portal. Delivery is through a Mercedes-Benz sales partner.
Once stuck on the smartphone, the Digital Vehicle Key Sticker allows contactless opening, closing and starting of the vehicle.
To start the engine, the driver simply needs to place their smartphone with the NFC sticker in the center console stowage tray. Qi-compatible smartphones, i.e. those with a corresponding receiver coil for wireless charging, are also inductively charged while in the tray.
NFC is an international communications standard for short-range wireless data exchange. Data transfer begins automatically when an NFC-capable device is held close to another device.
The Digital Vehicle Key from Mercedes-Benz transfers the authorization to drive the vehicle to a secured and encrypted chip in the phone or sticker. This can then be used as a car key. The Digital Vehicle Key Sticker is also available for a number of car lines in conjunction with digital vehicle key for smartphone.

Users caught for parking their shared bicycles indiscriminately more than three times in a year will be banned temporarily from renting from all bike-sharing operators, following amendments made to the Parking Places Act passed on Tuesday.
The new law, tabled in Parliament earlier this month, places operators offering dockless shared bikes, personal mobility devices (PMDs) and power-assisted bicycles under a licensing regime.
It will give the Land Transport Authority (LTA) more teeth to fine or sanction errant operators, such as by revoking their licences or curtailing their fleet size, TODAY reported on Tuesday.
Applications for bike-sharing operator licences will commence in the middle of the year, and will be awarded by the fourth quarter of this year, the LTA announced earlier.
Under the licensing regime, the authority can direct operators to impose a time-limited ban on users caught for parking their shared vehicles indiscriminately more than three times in a year. The exact length of the time-limited ban, however, is unclear.

“The majority of users are responsible and park the shared vehicles in designated parking areas. However, there are irresponsible and inconsiderate users who do not do so. It is important to hold them accountable,” said Senior Minister of State for Transport and Health Lam Pin Min in Parliament on Tuesday.

Bike-sharing operators will also be able to share information of recalcitrant users who have improperly parked bicycles in public places among themselves, with Lam saying the information sharing “will be limited to the extent necessary for implementing the collective ban”.
There are currently around 100,000 shared bicycles here, across six operators: oBike, mobike, ofo, SG Bikes, GBikes and bikesharing.sg.
Failure to comply with the licensing regime can result in operators facing financial penalties, such as fines of up to S$100,000 (2.4 million baht), reductions in fleet size, suspension, or even a revocation of their licence.
Currently, the LTA imposes an S$500 fine on operators for every indiscriminately-parked bicycle that is not removed within a stipulated time.
Since the middle of last year, the LTA has issued more than 2,100 removal notices and collected about S$180,000 in fines and administrative fees from the operators.
Last month, Lam also said in Parliament that a total of 341 of indiscriminately parked bikes had also been impounded since enforcement actions commenced in May last year.

Chip giant Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC) and the firm Juniper Research have evaluate global cities on various “Smart City” initiatives.
The two sides studied the promise of such technology not through the lens of urban planners but through the cities’ residents.
Intel hopes to better connect the outcomes of Smart City infrastructure investment to residents’ needs, thereby creating more buy-in.
“People move to cities and work hard for a better life. What is the end game? They want to be happy,” said Sameer Sharma, global general manager of Smart Cities IoT solutions at Intel.
That noted, city life can create impediments to happiness, such as traffic, caregiving challenges and the amount of time spent at work.
“That creates high levels of stress,” Sharma said. “It’s not about making cities smarter, it’s (about) making them happier and how technology can find savings for the average citizen.”
Using publicly available data points such as announced projects and requests for proposals, the team honed in on 20 global cities and ranked them based on the amount of time given back to residents. Portland came in No. 12: The basis for the ranking and the full list are revealed by clicking through the slides.
The study examined four indicators: mobility, health care, public safety and productivity.
According to the report, smart cities give back average city residents three working weeks of time every year. About 60 hours can be saved using smart traffic systems while about 21 hours can be saved by using apps and digital services to access city agencies. Another 35 hours can be saved in public safety by using predictive technology or smart traffic signals to route emergency vehicles.

Smart cities are a big market for Intel since such infrastructure creates such vast amounts of data.
That data either needs to be crunched on site through what’s known as edge devices, or sent back to data centers. Intel has a piece of all of that.
All of this occurs alongside a macro trend of urbanization. Sharma noted that today one of two people live in cities globally. That number is expected to rise to two out of three within 12 years.
“We are adding 3 million people a week into the urban areas. That is one new Chicago every week globally,” he said. “We feel it in traffic and parking and pollution, but it’s such a macro trend, it will change the face of the planet, and we have to do it right.”
Portland’s appearance among these global rankings alongside Singapore, Seoul, Tokyo and Dubai has a lot to do with the city’s ability to articulate what it is doing. Sharma has spoken with Portland officials about using technology to enhance the city’s quality of life.
One such project, a collaboration between the city, Intel, GE and AT&T, was announced two weeks ago. The project will replace lighting in the Central Eastside with 200 smart lights, outfitted with sensors powered by Intel for computer vision analytics, that look to address traffic flow and parking challenges.
The opportunity is that, globally, there are 700 million street lights. If all those lights are enhanced with sensors, it can quickly create a much broader network of infrastructure, Sharma said.
That information can be shared not only with city officials but, with open APIs, it can inform other company products. Or, it could help entrepreneurs build new products and services.








“It’s something similar to the mobile revolution,” Sharma said. “First there were smartphones and then basic apps. We are very clear that the breakthroughs come when we build the developer ecosystem.”

When I lived in Singapore in 2017, the frequent breakdown of the city-state’s “world-class” metro and its slow buses led me into the world of bike sharing.
Now, the three bike sharing companies I used there — ofo, Mobike, and Obike — have touched down in the South Korean cities of Busan and Suwon, signalling their intent to conquer Asia’s fourth largest economy. So are South Koreans ready to pedal into the shared economy of two-wheeled transportation?
Mobike and ofo, both from China, are the Samsung and Apple of the global bike sharing industry, with 100-200 million users each worldwide and presences in more than 200 cities each. There are other players, too, such as Obike (Singapore) or LimeBike (US), but these are largely unknown outside their respective countries.
Tencent-backed Mobike arrived in Suwon, a city to south of Seoul, in December 2017. ofo, backed by Alibaba, arrived a month later, choosing Busan, South Korea’s second-biggest city, as its first destination.
What differentiates these companies from many other  private and government-run systems is that they are dockless (you don’t need to park them at designated stations), and have mobile-centric app-based systems that allow users to locate, reserve and pay for nearby bicycles from mobile devices.
Bike sharing is generally a cash-burning business due to high installation and operating costs and low usage fees. But some operators, like Seoul Metropolitan Government (SMG), took the plunge into it anyway. The city launched its own bike sharing scheme, “Seoul Bike Ttareungyi,” in 2015.
Sure enough, the Seoul scheme made a big loss too: In 2016, the city racked up more than 4.2 billion won in operating costs but made just one billion in revenue. Critics have taken issue with Ttareungyi’s tricky registration process and the fact that users have to return bicycles to registered docks around the city, adding a layer of inconvenience.

 
Suwon, after weighing up the costs, opted to bring in private operators instead of launching its own bicycle eco-system according to Han Sang-bae, head of the city’s Bicycle Culture Team.
“We have Mobike and Obike now and we plan to accept other operators,” Han told Korea Exposé.
On November 2017, SMG also entered into a private partnership with South Korea-based MaaS Asia, which claims to be the country’s first private bike sharing company. MaaS Asia started providing its “S bikes,” which do not use docks, on a trial basis in the capital in November 2017.
Seoul city requires private bike-sharing companies to share their user data with the city in the name of “public interest.” Despite their apparent loss-making, many believe that user data are one of the most valuable assets acquired by bike sharing companies. Captured by apps and GPS systems, the data provide insights into the riding habits and consumer behavior of users.
The financial states of these businesses are unclear, because they aren’t publicly listed. Many media report that the ventures are financially unsound; others argue that accumulated user data deposits are giving these companies secret cash cows.

Only 8.3 percent of South Koreans cycled every day in 2017– a major stumbling block to bike sharing companies. Moreover, the country’s bicycle lanes are few and badly connected, traffic conditions can be dangerous, and the landscape is hilly.
It’s also questionable whether these Chinese companies will be able to expand into Seoul, home to South Korea’s biggest cycling population, because of new regulations from SMG requiring bike sharing companies to provide a certain amount of parking space, and pick up illegally parked bicycles from around the city.
In an October 2017 press release, Mobike said it had picked Suwon first because of local authorities’ “vision of transforming the city into a people-centered, environmentally friendly eco-city.” ofo declined to share specific details of its operation in Busan.
The concept of bike-sharing is still new, especially in South Korea. It remains to be seen whether the newly-arrived foreign bike sharing companies can become established in the country. But if they do, they may even contribute to cleaning the country’s air: ofo claims to have prevented over 3.24 million tons of carbon emissions since its launch, while Mobike asserted that it had prevented 1.26 million tons by mid-2017.

In a world where technology is increasingly ubiquitous, it seems every city is a smart city. The mass deployment of broadband infrastructure, mobile phones, and wireless connectivity is just the beginning. The Internet of Things—a web of connected devices and sensors in the physical world can interact with analytics systems, using machine learning to turn realms of real-time data into new insights and instant responses. However, building a smart city means more than hardware deployment. What makes a city truly smart is how it uses all that technology to deliver better outcomes for its citizens. While debates in the past were often focused on the technologies themselves, the discussion must now turn to the needs of residents, the concrete problems to be solved, and how smart cities can be built to address those root problems. 
The authors in this compilation explore the application of cyberphysical technology around three main themes. First is bringing intelligence into the citizen’s daily life whether in water conservation and use, transportation, home sharing or security. Cities are increasingly realizing that the benefits of smart cities go far beyond efficiency gains: technology is helping cities become more livable and sustainable. Moscow’s transportation program, for example, aims to save Muscovites a week of commuting time a year through an integrated, technology-enabled initiative to change the average citizen’s mobility experience. Second, technology is changing how governments think about serving their citizens. Governments are reimagining their systems and processes with an eye toward ensuring not just an improved living experience but also equitable access to infrastructure and programs, becoming more responsive and citizen-centric. From Pune, India, to Toronto, Canada, smart city technology is speeding up the metabolic rate of government. Third, the landscapes through which we move are transforming under our feet. Initiatives from waterfront revitalization to greenfield city development are creating new venues for the deployment of technologies that can turn deserts into industrial valleys and rust belts into brain belts. Chinese cities are transforming by adopting technologies to green their riverfronts and prepare for a new industrial age, even as they bring back traditional concepts of human-based placemaking. Implementing digital solutions on a citywide scale requires vision and persistence—which is why this issue of Voices brings together multiple case studies from around the globe. Mayors, experts, technology leaders, and residents themselves all have a role to play. We hope these perspectives help guide decision makers in shaping the smart cities of the future.

Jai Allen says cab service in Winnipeg is lacking.
“Last time I was on vacation came back from the airport had to tell the guy how to get there he was on his phone half the time,” said Allen.
Allen is training to be a TappCar driver now that ride sharing is permitted in Winnipeg as of March 1.
“I’m semi-retired something to do, meet some new people give them an opportunity for a better taxi ride,” said Allen.
TappCar is one of three ride sharing companies authorized to operate in Winnipeg now. Cowboy Taxi and InstaRyde are the others.
TappCar says it expects to train 500 drivers by month’s end, with 50 cars on the street Friday.
“It’s a big response here, this market is pretty good for the ride share,” said Balraj Manhas of TappCar, adding that expectations are high.

In response to the new competition, taxi cab industry is vowing to offer the best service for customers. Duffy’s and Unicity said they’re making several changes to increase safety and service including:

Enhanced driver training
The creation of an advisory council to handle customer complaints
Moves to repair relationships, specifically with members of the Indigenous community
A pilot project using collision avoidance technology.

“We can’t control what our competitors are going to do, we can only control what we’re going to do. And we’re upping our game,” said Scott McFadyen of the Winnipeg Taxi Community Coalition.
Some of the potential major competitors remain on the sidelines.
Uber and Lyft won’t ride into Winnipeg. They have concerns about MPI’s insurance model. But both companies had representatives in the city Thursday to let people know they still want to operate here.
“We want Winnipeggers to know that we’re ready to launch, but for some concerns with the MPI ride sharing product,” said Chris Schafer, Uber Canada.
Mayor Brian Bowman hopes the hurdle can be cleared, but is pleased there will be some ride sharing options available.
“I’m hoping it’s the beginning of many more choices in the market place, and time will tell if Uber and Lyft enter the market place,” said Bowman.

China’s biggest online to offline (O2O) service provider, Meituan-Dianping, is tapping into the ride-hailing sector. It has attracted 200,000 users in Beijing for its new ride-hailing service, which is yet to be opened. Apart from Beijing, Meituan-Dianping started to register users in other cities including Shanghai, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Fuzhou and Xiamen. Its nationwide expansion indicates that it will take on prominent market leader, Didi Chuxing, China’s largest ride-hailing app operator with estimated 450 million users.
Heavy subsidies to attract drivers and passengers
Bonuses for users matter a lot, which was once a key strategy to Didi Chuxing’s success. To attract drivers to sign up to its platform, Meituan-Dianping launched a policy declaring that the first 50,000 drivers to sign up will be exempt from a commission cut, while its competitor Didi Chuxing takes a 20% cut from drivers. Drivers complain that the commission fee charged by Didi Chuxing is very high, therefore a new ride-hailing platform is welcomed by drivers.
Before the recruitment of users, Meituan-Dianping had begun to test the service in Nanjing 10 months ago. Its daily orders have exceeded 100,000 and the operation team has reached 200 people. Passengers in Nanjing are willing to use Meituan-Dianping due to its continuous vouchers for users. It is estimated that the subsidy for each order is equal to RMB 20 (USD 3.11) and costs USD 310,000 in total every day.
Meituan-Dianping’s strategy of subsidising reminds us of Uber’s entry into China. Uber entered China in August, 2014 and invested subsidies of USD 2 billion in China, however this caused deception in relation to subsidies among drivers. Uber China merged with Didi Chuxing in August 2016.
Will Meituan-Dianping follow a similar path to Uber China? Chen Shaoli, Meituan-Dianping’s Senior Vice-President of corporate development, claimed that Meituan-Dianping will not rely much on user subsidies and therefore will not go down Uber’s path.
Ride-hailing is part of O2O service loop
What made Meituan-Dianping enter the ride-sharing sector? Wang Xing, founder and CEO of Meituan-Dianping, claimed that Meituan-Dianping would like to do business relating to O2O which stands for ‘offline to online’ and ride-hailing services. According to an internal email at the end of last year, Wang said that the company would upgrade its platform in four aspects: when users are in a store, at home, in a car, or travelling.
Wang Xing, founder and CEO of Meituan-Dianping. Photo from ifeng.com
As a pioneer of O2O, Meituan-Dianping provides various services including food delivery and hotel bookings. The great number of users and their demands for transportation services give Meituan-Dianping an opportunity to enter the ride-hailing arena.
A manager working for Meituan Dache, its riding-sharing branch, told ThePaper.cn that 30% out of 250 million active users have been demanding transport services. The entry into the riding-sharing sector will help Meituan-Dianping to improve its service functions and to be an integrated platform.
Apart from users’ needs, another underlying cause that drove Meituan-Dianping to enter the new sector is that ride-hailing services will help to increase Meituan-Dianping’s valuation. At present, Meituan-Dianping has become the world’s fourth-most valuable startup, reaching a USD 30 billion valuation. However, the valuation for Meituan-Dianping doesn’t satisfy its CEO, Wang’s, estimate of USD 100 billion. The new business of ride-sharing services offers a big piece of the pie, and its valuation may exceed the entire scale of Meituan-Dianping’s other businesses including food delivery, hotel bookings, travelling, movies and so on. Therefore, the entry to the ride-sharing business will help to improve Meituan-Dianping’s valuation significantly.
Blurred boundaries
The boundaries between different industries has been blurring. While Meituan-Dianping planned to enter Didi Chuxing’s ride-hailing market, Didi Chuxing invested in Ele.me, a leading food delivery startup in China, to do food delivery. This is not a new business model. The combination of food delivery and ride-hailing has been done successfully by Uber Eats.
That Meituan-Dianping and Didi Chuxing enter their main competitors’ market is not by accident. Apart from the dominance of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent which are called ‘BAT’, Toutiao, Meituan-Dianping and ride-sharing giant, Didi Chuxing, have been known as ‘TMD’. Obviously, Meituan-Dianping and Didi Chuxing see each other as the most important competitor.
Will Meituan-Dianping succeed? In fact, Meituan-Dianping did not launch its platform in Beijing by Jan 12 as it had planned, because it was assumed that Meituan-Dianping hadn’t received legal qualification from the administration. However, in the area of ride-hailing, Meituan-Dianping still has opportunities to achieve its market share through its efforts.
Firstly, the ride-sharing market is so huge that one giant, Didi Chuxing, cannot satisfy all the market needs. The rapid growth of users registration on Meituan Dache demonstrates this.
Secondly, Meituan-Dianping has a large user base and its integrated platform to provide various types of services is easy to use for users. Statistics show that the overlap ratio of drivers using Didi Chuxing and Meituan Dache is 19.46% in Nanjing, which means 19.46% Didi Chuxing Users use Meituan Dache at the same time.
On the other hand, the challenge that Meituan-Dianping needs to face is the stable dominance of Didi Chuxing in this market, in which bike-sharing startups have grabbed part of the market share. In fact, the era of rapid growth of the ride-hailing sector has passed. In addition, Didi Chuxing’s technological advancement cannot be ignored. Didi Chuxing has been well-known for its technological advancement which includes transportation predictions, big data and so on. That’s what Meituan-Dianping’s coupons cannot resolve in the short term.

When Zach Rogers went on his lunch break one day last week, instead of unwinding for a few minutes, he hit the streets of Palmyra looking for people needing a ride.
Rogers is one of the first Uber drivers registered in Northern Missouri, the last geographical market of the state for the app-based ride-sharing company to penetrate.
Uber and other ride-sharing companies — notably Lyft — have challenged traditional taxicab companies for viability in the transportation industry increasingly in recent years. Uber drivers utilize their own vehicles, set their own work schedule, and can drive anywhere in their designated area.
With his registration in northern Missouri, Rogers can drive people anywhere in the state of Missouri, including on long-distance trips from Hannibal to St. Louis, Kansas City, or even Branson, Mo. — five hours away.
The business is entirely app-based, with potential riders identifying their destination through the app and the nearest Uber driver summoned to take them there. Riders create an account and enter payment information. Payment is automatic with the information on file once the ride concludes.
Rogers originally applied to be a driver in Columbia, Mo., but once Uber opened driving to the northern third of the state, he applied to drive based out of Hannibal.
“I downloaded the Uber Driver app, and most of the application process took place there. They ask (optionally) for references for your driving.
After the first part is done, they need your drivers license, insurance information, as well as vehicle registration,” Rogers said. “After confirming the vehicle is able to drive for Uber, they have to put you through a background check.
This took about two weeks to conclude, as they are pretty thorough with the process.”
Uber is fairly new in much of Missouri, with questions regarding ride-sharing regulations were resolved when Gov. Eric Greitens signed House Bill 13 into law in April allowing the businesses to operate in the Show-Me without regulations.
However, the bill requires app-based companies to conduct driver background checks and pay a licensing fee. Uber does not pay local taxes and does not have a business license on file, according to Hannibal city clerk Angel Zerbonia.
While ride-sharing service thrive in cities with a high population density, will it succeed in more rural markets?
Rogers thinks it has a chance.
“Most people do not even realize it is available here yet,” he said. “My wife and I have posted in a Facebook group three or four times advertising the arrival of Uber in the area, and each time there are a large amount of people who are just then finding out about it.”


With more exposure, he predicts business will pick
up.
“I think it can be especially useful in our downtown area near the bars,” he said. “Maybe out at the (Mark Twain) casino (in La Grange) could be a good place as well. It’s just a matter of getting everyone to know it’s out there.
I try to stay active until after 2 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, and I see all kinds of taxis driving people around.”
Riders are able to rate their drivers using the app, so a potential rider can know a little bit more about the driver.
“I have had some people use the service though, and I think it went very well. With Uber you often get a level a interaction and fun you wouldn’t get with a taxi driver,” he said.
Without having to abide by a taxicab company’s policies, Rogers can do things like allow the rider to control the music. He also has snacks in his car available for riders.
According to its website, Lyft also operates in Northern Missouri through its Columbia, Mo., market.

The advent of Uber in cities across the country has reduced per capita ambulance volume by at least 7 percent as low-risk patients likely opt to avoid the more expensive ride with paramedics, according to a working paper co-authored by a University of Kansas economist.
“In order to lower health care spending while improving health outcomes, people can use the least-skilled professional who is still qualified,” said David Slusky, assistant professor of economics. “It’s the same in the provider space: you don’t need a neurosurgeon to diagnose strep throat.”
With emergency room patients who are too sick to drive but who don’t need medical care during the drive, an Uber would suffice. An ambulance ride can cost someone or their insurers hundreds to even thousands of dollars.
“Many patients don’t need something that can break traffic laws and don’t need something staffed by paramedics with a bunch of fancy equipment,” Slusky said.
Slusky and co-author Leon Moskatel, of the Department of Medicine at Scripps Mercy Hospital in San Diego, examined ambulance rates in 766 U.S. cities across the country in 43 states as Uber entered their markets from 2013 through 2015.
In those cities comparing before and after Uber became available, the ambulance usage rate decreased at least 7 percent.
Slusky said an alternate explanation some researchers have examined is whether Uber reduced the need for ambulances because Uber availability reduces the number of crashes or drunken drivers or both. However, he said the evidence is still too mixed on that to believe that less drunken driving is the drop’s primary reason.
The more likely explanation, Slusky said, is that people who need emergency care but not an ambulance now have another option to safely transport them to the hospital. Ambulance trips are costly to patients and their insurance companies, so people likely look for a way to avoid them, if possible, he said.
One potential policy implication could be insurance companies encouraging patients to consider taking an Uber — possibly by offering them a $50 gift card or something comparable — instead of calling an ambulance or at least educating them about other transport services as a potential option, Slusky said.

Other than the expense, a potential benefit is that Uber usage could reduce wait times for remaining ambulance volume, meaning people who really need ambulances get them faster.
“Given that even a reduction of a few minutes can drastically improve survival rates for serious conditions, this could be associated with a substantial welfare improvement,” the researchers said in the paper.
Slusky said it’s important to conduct this type of research to uncover unintended consequences of Uber entering a market. Transportation services are especially valuable in the context of the high cost of American health care.
“We want to find every way possible,” he said, “to bend the medical cost curve.”

D.C. commuters are used to sharing cars and bikes. The next big thing: sharing scooters.
Waybots, a California-based startup, is rolling out an electric scooter-sharing service in D.C., and a second company will soon follow suit. The arrival marks one more step in the ever expanding market for transportation-sharing services in D.C., which run the gamut from car2go to Capital Bikeshare to five dockless bikeshare companies, which are wrapping up a six-month pilot program in the city.
Scooter sharing is basically what it sounds like. You use a phone-based app to find one of Waybots’s yellow electric scooters, pay a fee — $1 to start, and 15 cents per minute thereafter — and use the scooter to get around. Once you get to your destination, you just leave the scooter for someone else to use.
Terry Owens, a spokesman for the D.C. Department of Transportation, says Waybots just soft-launched in D.C., and hopes to bring between 50 and 400 scooters to the city. The company is entering the market through the ongoing pilot program for dockless bikeshares.
“They are governed by the same terms and conditions as the bike companies,” explained Owens, which includes limiting the number of vehicles the deploy and also sharing data with the city on their use.
Another scooter-sharing company, Bird, “will be launching in D.C. soon,” according to a company spokesperson. It is already in operation in Los Angeles, where it is based.
Bikesharing and now scooter-sharing are part of what’s known as “last-mile” transit options, which help people get from a Metro station to their office or home. Capital Bikeshare has been operating in D.C. since 2010, and the company now has 3,700 bikes at more than 440 stations across D.C., Maryland and Virginia.

The new dockless bikeshare companies — Spin, Ofo, Jump, Limebike and Mobike — say they offer more flexibility since their bikes do not have to be locked or picked up at fixed stations like Capital Bikeshare.
But the bikes have also prompted complaints from people who say they block sidewalks, are easily stolen and have been found everywhere from local rivers to Metro platforms.
But according to DDOT, actual public complaints about the dockless bikes have been limited. Of 336 emailed comments about the bikes, DDOT classified 247 as “explicitly supportive” and 81 as “explicitly opposed.”
The dockless bikeshare pilot is expected to wrap up by April, after which city officials will determine what type of permanent presence the bike companies — and possibly the scooter companies — will have in the future.

Solving the pervasive problem of traffic congestion will require an approach that extends beyond bans on ride-hailing services, but looks to more nuanced solutions like better managing street right-of-ways and technology to give public transit priority on crowded streets.
TriMet, the transit agency serving the Portland, Ore., metro area, is exploring a next-generation transit signal prioritization system that goes even further than simply lengthening a green light for a bus that may be running behind schedule.
The new system — about a year away — will know how many passengers are on the bus, where the vehicle is headed, the bus’s relationship to other transit vehicles and other data points, which ultimately, get passed along to the intelligent traffic signal.

“So this is all about making high-occupancy vehicles move through the congested areas faster than your Uber and Lyft that have one or two people in it,” said A.J. O’Connor, manager of intelligent transportation systems at TriMet, during a Nov. 14 webinar hosted by Meeting of the Minds, a nonprofit dedicated to studying smart cities issues and solutions.
Some of the same intelligent data-heavy technology is also being tested in the system’s light-rail trains in what is known as Rail Operations Optimization Technology (ROOT). The technologies would allow trains to operate more efficiently and even closer together, and in effect, transport more passengers.
“We don’t know where our light-rail vehicles are, to the same level of granularity as the bus. We don’t know how many passengers, in real time, are on that vehicle to the same level that we do the bus,” O’Connor explained.
“That’s because train tracking, in a lot of areas in the U.S., is still reliant on field technology that was designed to prevent trains from running into each other. And so, they only care about that the train is in this block of area, and not allowing it to go forward into another block, where another train sits.”
The emphasis by transit agencies to step in and help solve traffic congestions comes amid several reports showing traffic slowing to a near crawl in cities like San Francisco and New York, with transportation network companies (TNCs) being fingered as the culprit. The move also comes in the wake of public transit ridership declines in recent years.
From 2015 to 2016, roughly 80 percent of the top 30 transit agencies saw a decrease in ridership, said Adrian Pearmine, national director for smart cities and connected vehicles with transportation planning and engineering firm DKS Associates.
“And the small few that had an increase in ridership, it was very, very small, nominal amounts increase in ridership,” he added, during the webinar. In fact, 2018 may be what Pearmine calls the “tipping point,” where TNC and taxi combined ridership — trips — surpasses bus ridership, nationwide.
However, before too much blame is laid at the door of Uber and Lyft, Pearmine noted that in cities where rail is an option — which would be a number of medium-sized or larger cities — 85 percent of trips are still made in private vehicles, and less than 2 percent are via taxi or ride-hailing.
“It’s important to note that TNCs are certainly not the only cause of [public transit] ridership going down. There are a number of different factors,” he remarked.
To tackle the issue of both congestion and declining public transit ridership, officials in both the public and private sector will need to work more collaboratively, said Pearmine.
“Where we’re really going to need to focus a lot is on policy change,” he continued.
“There’s physical places where we can work together, the concept of mobility hubs, and technical places, like the concept of mobility as a service,” said Pearmine.
In Columbus, the Central Ohio Transit Authority, (COTA) is moving forward with the creation of four “Smart Mobility Hubs” where bus service, bike- and car-share companies, ride-hailing and other community services come together. The hubs will be anchored by an interactive kiosk, providing not just transit information and trip-planning across multiple forms of transportation.

Transit planners in Portland, as well as Columbus, Chicago and other cities are all moving aggressively on projects to place trip-planning across multiple mobility providers — and payment — on a single application.
“What we hope to do later,” said O’Connor is, “add the ability to not only plan your itinerary, but pay for your whole trip.” TriMet has multimodal trip-planning technology set for beta testing in December.
Officials in Columbus announced it selected Columbus-based MTECH Solutions LLC to develop its multimodal trip-planning and common payment system app.
The common payment system “will allow the end user to easily pay for the multiple forms of transportation with one payment, which will also have a cash-based option for residents that are unbanked,” the city said in a press release.
All of these approaches are the steps needed to solve congestion by making transit the more favorable option among city and suburban dwellers.
“Philosophically, I think TriMet and the city of Portland, and the region here is still very committed to trying to promote and prioritize high-occupancy vehicles on frequent service routes, whether that’s light-rail vehicles or that’s buses,” said O’Connor.

If you’ve spotted an unattended yellow bike parked in arbitrary spots around town, don’t fret—they do indeed serve a purpose.
The dockless two-wheelers are part of a new variety of bike-share programs that debuted this past December.
Dockless bikes lock themselves and do not require a rack or station. Users, though, are encouraged to avoid blocking public rights of way or parking bicycles on residential properties, at bus stops or in alleyways.
Tempe’s official bike share vendor is GRID, operated by CycleHop.
Launched last May, this docked system provides another alternative to residents and visitors for getting around the city with ease.
Since the project’s startup, users have taken over 20,000 rides on the 300 bicycles located in Tempe.
In December, dockless bikes began operating in Tempe without any formal agreement with the city.
Ofo, the yellow bike provider, is a station-free bike sharing company that began operating in Tempe about three weeks ago.
“The…innovation and the nice effect of this bike, aside from being a good bike, is it can kind of be everywhere,” said Paul Vidal, general manager of Ofo in Phoenix. “You’re never that far from one, and you don’t have to go a mile or two out of your way to look for a dock.”
Ofo works similar to Uber or Lyft. A smart phone app is required to unlock and pay for the bike.
Ofo bikes cost $1 per hour to ride.
“Tempe is a community that really makes sense for the bikes,” Vidal said. “The weather makes sense, the user profile makes sense.”
But with a couple thousand Ofo riders a day in Tempe, Vidal said there will always be a handful of complaints.
Because the bikes are dockless, in order to secure the bike properly, the back tire automatically locks in place.
“A lot of users…they take liberties with the bikes and put them in places they shouldn’t be,” Vidal said. “That’s the nature of a lot of the complaints we see.”

Vidal insists that these occurrences are rare.
“But that doesn’t excuse them at all,” Vidal said.
In Tempe and Scottsdale, Vidal said he has a combined staff of 20 whose full-time job is to
“rebalance” the bikes. Each bike is GPS-tracked and monitored based on how often someone rides it.
“What that means is finding where the bad bikes are, or shouldn’t be, via the GPS network we use with these bikes, collecting them and putting them in places that can serve people,” Vidal said.
The city is currently looking into the legalities of the bike rental companies’ use of public rights of way as well as city property, said TaiAnna Yee, a public information officer for the city of Tempe.
“Moving forward, Tempe is working with other cities (Phoenix, Mesa and Scottsdale) to create a regional solution to address dockless bikes,” Yee said. “The city is doing its best to create regulations for these companies to follow. We are in the process of re-examining our city ordinances so that we may recommend modifications to our City Council to allow for a more orderly system.”
Vidal said if there is a bike that needs to be moved promptly, the best way to contact Ofo is via e-mail at support@ofobike.com. Bikes will be moved within 24-hours.
“We’re excited and committed to working with the city,” Vidal said. “We’re not good stewards of our community if we don’t take care of business that doesn’t work.”

One of the colorful players in the rapidly-expanding rental bike market may soon be wheeling down local streets.


The bike-sharing service LimeBike has approached College Place seeking to start operating in the city.


The company has also approached Walla Walla and the City Council is scheduled to discuss the issue at its Feb. 12 work session, said City Manager Nabiel Shawa.



At the College Place City Council’s Jan. 9 meeting, City Administrator Mike Rizzitiello briefed officials on the company, which is seeking a memorandum of understanding to operate in the city limits.

No action on the proposal is expected until February, Rizzitiello said an email.




The LimeBike system uses a phone app to let people find and rent bikes, which are self-locking and do not need docking stations. According to the company, LimeBike would cover all maintenance costs and the service would cost the city nothing.
The rental fee would be $1 per half-hour, but reduced rates would be offered to students and for those who opt for a prepayment plan.


In talking with the company, Rizzitiello said officials indicated they would likely start out with around 200 bikes apiece in College Place and Walla Walla “and have it pretty much all over town,” including bikes placed at Walmart and at multiple locations around Walla Walla University.



“This company has been growing like wildfire all over the country,” Rizzitiello told Council members.
According to news reports, LimeBike now has 3,000 bicycles on the streets in Seattle, where it is competing with two other rental bike companies, Ofo and Spin Bike.


Based in San Mateo, Calif., LimeBike said it is now operating in 23 cities and 11 college campuses.



The company has recently expanded to Pullman and because College Place became engaged with LimeBike soon after that, Rizzitiello said the city is before other cities racing to get the service.



“So should we decide to adopt this on the next month or two, we’re guaranteed a shoo-in to be one of the newer cities that this displays at,” he said.


Council member Loren Peterson said he used LimeBike during a recent trip to Seattle and it went well for him.


“It’s a neat app. You can report problems with the bike and you have (the) responsibility when you check it out that you have to put it back, so (the bike is) not alongside the road,” he said. “So it’s pretty slick.”

Over the past several years, a number of altogether new and different businesses have emerged. What their underlying business models have in common is that they operate in “sharing economies” of collaborative consumption(Botsman & Rogers, 2010), where people offer and share underutilized resources in creative, new ways. Airbnb lets people rent out part or all of their homes for short stays, and Uber allows for real-time, location based ridesharing. An increasing number of individuals who may not have considered ridesharing or renting a room in private residence as their vacation domicile a few years ago now prefer such sharing models to mainstream alternatives. While some of these sharing models might have resulted from a need for frugal spending after the global economic recession of 2008, their success was also driven by a growing environmental consciousness combined with the ubiquity of Internet and associated information and communication technologies which make sharing possible at scale. Together, these developments have started to challenge traditional thinking about how resources can and should be offered andconsumed, supporting arguments that incremental improvements in our existing production and consumption systems are insufficient to transform our global economy toward sustainability (Lovins & Cohen, 2011; Stead & Stead, 2013). The potential sustainability benefits associated with such sharing economies are interesting from an organizational and environmental perspective, particularly in the context of the increasing urbanization many countries experience today. Especially in growing cities, numerous drivers support the introduction of such sustainability-oriented innovations (Hansen, Grosse-Dunker, & Reichwald, 2009), ranging from market imperfections (Cohen & Winn, 2007) and environmental regulations (Rugman & Verbeeke, 2000) to emerging demand for sustainable solutions from consumer, corporate, and government stakeholders (Hart, 1997). Due to its relative newness, research on the relationship between business and sustainability theory in the context of a sharing economy, as “an economic model based on sharing underutilized assets from spaces to skills to stuff for monetary or non-monetary benefits” (Botsman, 2013) is scarce. More specifically, despite the growing demand and opportunity for sustainable mobility solutions from the private sector, there is a surprising dearth of research in the public policy and management disciplines regarding factors influencing the adoption and success or failure of collaborations between the private sector and cities in solving urban sustainability challenges (Alexandrescu, Martinát, Klusáček, & Barke, 2014).






The aim of this research is to explore emerging sustainability business models for one segment of the sharing economy, shared mobility. An interesting aspect of shared mobility solutions is that multiple agents, including public and private providers, seek to develop business models which address deficiencies in public infrastructure (e.g., streets, parking) and public transit systems, historically the exclusive purview of local and regional governments. However, the common interest in sustainability among these different types of agents does not always lead to harmony, instead giving rise to agency conflicts that can reduce the positive sustainability impact of their individual and collective initiatives. There are literally dozens of unique business models in the shared mobility arena. We have chosen to focus on three broad segments of shared mobility, carsharing, ridesharing, and bikesharing, to explore our core research question: In the context of shared mobility business models, what is the optimal relationship between the service provider and the local government to achieve
the common objective of sustainable mobility?

A Fingal public bike sharing scheme similar to the successful Dublin Bike scheme operating in the city, is a significant step closer this week with news that Fingal County Council is to seek expressions of interest to operate the scheme in Fingal.




Cllr Duncan Smith (Lab) who is a keen cyclist and has been campaigning for some time for the introduction of a bike sharing scheme in Fingal, has welcomed the news.


He said the council decision to seek expressions of interest for potential operators of the scheme follows agreement from the members of the Transportation Strategic Policy Committee,
Cllr Smith welcomed the development, saying: ‘This is great news. I have been leading on this issue in the council since I got elected and today’s announcement is a real positive step forward.


‘I brought my first Motion to the council in 2014 on this and I successfully brought a series of motions to the Fingal County Development Plan which inserted as an objective, the introduction of a Public Bike Scheme in Swords and Fingal.’

Explaining the logic behind the introduction of the scheme in Fingal, the Labour councillor from Swords said: ‘A bike sharing scheme for Fingal, similar to the one that operates in Dublin City would be a real benefit to the county.


‘Given the growth of our towns, and the distances people have to travel to get to train stations, bus stops, town centres and schools, a bike sharing scheme is a no-brainer.’
Cllr Smith concluded: ‘It is so encouraging to see Fingal County Council take this campaign forward.
I understand the expression of interest is for two pilot schemes, one for the towns of North County including our county town Swords and a pilot scheme for Dublin 15.’

A revamped online service can help local residents find someone to share a ride with — whether it’s a regular commute to work or a one-time trip to Denver International Airport.
Mountain Metropolitan Transit’s newly-improved “RidePro” database helps users find others they can carpool with by matching registrants based on their travel schedules, origins and destinations.
With the rising popularity of smartphone apps like Uber and Lyft, the transit authority wants to cater to those looking for cheaper, more environmentally-friendly ways to get around.
“Ridesharing is a pretty hot topic these days,” said Vicki McCann, a Mountain Metro spokeswoman. “You can see that there’s a need out there for people to use other modes of transportation besides just single occupancy vehicles, and we thought it was important to make that easier to do.”
As of last month, the system included nearly 4,000 users.
“Vanpools” are another option available through the service. Under this mode of transit, the agency provides vans, vehicle maintenance, fuel and insurance to commuters who are headed departing from and heading to proximate locations. Mountain Metro has 25 vanpools, most of which travel from Colorado Springs to Denver with others going to the Pueblo Chemical Depot and Schriever Air Force Base.

Residents can also use the search engine to look for others to bike to work with or plan a trip on the bus system with real-time information on scheduled arrivals and departures provided through Google Maps. The service allows users to track how much money they save by using public transportation, biking or carpooling instead of driving solo.
While the carpooling database has been around since the mid-2000s, the upgrade was finished last year and recently cleared the beta testing stage, McCann said.
The new service is faster and more convenient, said Kelli Frazier, program manager for the city’s Metro Rides, which includes RidePro. Under the old system, a commuter would have to call a coordinator with the agency and later be notified if someone registered in the database shared a similar route.
“With the new system, they can just go onto the website, punch in their information and if there’s someone else in the system that matches with them, they will know that right away,” Frazier said.
RidePro is a product of the Trapeze Group, which markets transportation software to transit agencies.
The upgrade cost Mountain Metro roughly $47,000, McCann said. Vanpool fees paid for about 20 percent, and state funds generated through registration fees and fines under the state’s FASTER program covered the rest of the cost, she said.

Uber is now running on two wheels as well as four. This week, the contentious ride-hailing company began letting San Francisco users reserve pedal-assist electric bikes through its app.
The idea, according to the New York Times, is that “people will see the bicycles as a cheaper and faster alternative — not a huge stretch of the imagination for anyone who has been stuck in Friday evening gridlock traffic in San Francisco.”

The new feature comes courtesy of a partnership with Jump Bikes, a bike-sharing service that will offer 250 motorized bikes throughout the city.
“Having a greater variety of transportation modes at your fingertips helps make it increasingly easy to live life without a car,” the company said in a statement posted to its website. “We’re particularly excited about bikes because they can provide a convenient, environmentally friendly ride even in dense cities where space is limited and roads can be congested.”
Not too surprisingly, the pilot will feature dockless bikes that can be dropped off at any public rack in a zone designated by the app’s map.
Some officials have criticized the new model because it tends to rely on upfront venture-funding, and can create a right-of-way nightmare, with discarded bikes strewn haphazardly along sidewalks and in streets.
The model’s U.S. spread has been compared to Uber’s move-fast-and-break-things early days — although operators seem to have begun treading with more care over the last few months.
Dockless providers in Seattle and New Orleans have partnered with public agencies; others have signed code-of-conduct agreements with organizations like the North American Bike Share Association.

Uber declined to detail to the Times whether the San Francisco pilot was a preview of things to come in other cities, but it is another indication of the company’s desire to move beyond its ride-hailing origins.
Uber has also been working on autonomous trucking services and expanding into the food delivery market with Uber Eats.
And then, of course, there’s that promising first/last mile market that Uber has been racing to conquer. As the Verge recently reported, the addition of bikes “raises the possibility that other transportation options, like subways and buses, will also be integrated into the ride-hail service’s app down the line.”

Following in the tire tracks of other automakers, Nissan Motor Co. will introduce a car-sharing service, which allow registered members to rent and share vehicles, in January.
Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. have also put the pedal to the metal and entered the car-sharing business.
Nissan on Dec. 8 began accepting membership registrations on the website of its service, which the company has named “e-share mobi” (https://e-sharemobi.com).
For the time being, the company will keep one vehicle–either of its Leaf electric model or a gas-electric hybrid variant of its Note compact model–at each of its 30 or so stations to be located in nine prefectures, including Tokyo and Osaka.
A driver’s license card with an embedded IC chip will be used to unlock a car, whose rental fees start at 200 yen ($1.77) for 15 minutes.
Car-sharing services are catching on with customers for their convenience of use, which does not require a formal storefront.The Times Car Plus service, operated by market leader Park24 Co., had 20,000 cars available at 10,000 stations across Japan as of the end of October 2017.
Compared with five years earlier, the number of stations had grown threefold, the number of vehicles had quadrupled, and the number of memberships had increased six times.
Honda began test-operating a car-sharing service in Tokyo in November 2013. It keeps a total of 140 or so vehicles at 90 or so stations and has 11,000 registered members.
 

Toyota has acquired a stake in a U.S. business venture that operates a peer-to-peer car-sharing service, with which the automaker is test-operating a car-sharing system.
Both Nissan and Honda are offering their “pick-of-the-bunch” models in their car-sharing operations.
They are hoping that use by a broad customer base will lead to stronger subsequent sales of its automobiles.
For those worried about making an impression by showing up in a rental: Park24 on Dec. 8 released survey results showing that 52 percent of 20-somethings said there is “no problem” in going on a date in a rented or shared car.

Shared mobility refers to the behaviour of people sharing various modes of transportation (vehicle, bicycle, scooter or other modes) on an as-needed basis. The goal of shared mobility is to effectively and efficiently use transportation vehicles to help reduce carbon emissions, and congestion while also providing individuals cost-effective ways to get to their destinations.
Movmi has seen the shared mobility industry grown rapidly, even within just the last decade. Technology and mass adoption of smartphones has catalyzed some shared mobility transportation options such as car sharing and ride hailing. To get all users up to speed, we provided a primer below reviewing the key modes in shared mobility: car sharing, peer-to-peer carsharing, bike sharing, carpooling / ride sharing, and ride hailing. Each section will provide:

Car Sharing
Key Terms:
Car sharing: “Individuals gain the benefits of private vehicle use without the costs and responsibilities of ownership” (Shaheen 2015). The individual uses the vehicle when they want and usually pays for only what they use. The company looks after fuel, maintenance and repair tasks and insurance.
Station-Based Carsharing (Round Trip): The trip must end in the same place it started.
One-Way Carsharing: The vehicle can be picked-up at one station and returned at another.
Home Area: A virtual fence where individuals have the freedom to park their vehicle anywhere on permitted side-streets or company-marked parking locations.
Free-Floating: Pick up a vehicle and end the trip anywhere in the home area.

Overview:
Carsharing is not a new concept, it started in Switzerland in 1987. Since then it has grown worldwide, with rapid growth in China and the United States. As of July 2015, there are approximately 1.5 million car sharing members using 25,574 shared vehicles in the Americas (Shaheen 2016).  The goal of carsharing is to use assets more effectively (i.e. vehicles and land-use). We can see that the goal of carsharing is being achieved: in 2016, each carsharing vehicle replaced 10 personal cars and freed up 9 parking places (6-t Research 2016). The benefits of carsharing is real and now the challenge is to get it widely adopted.
History & Background: 
There has been many changes since the first car sharing concept launched. Car sharing began with a station-based model that used a paper based system to record trips. People also had to retrieve the keys by either finding it in a hidden hole somewhere behind the license plate or in a lockbox somewhere mounted to a wall close to the parking location of the car. Each member would fill out the trip login a physical ledger which was then collected and invoice on a monthly basis.
Car sharing has gained significant traction since then because of a few main factors:

Popularization of smartphones and technology allowed members to move from a paper based system with physical key handoff to a technology based solution
Attitude shift and acceptance towards subscription-based models and on-demand services over ownership models
Changes in travel behaviour due to increase in part-time work with varying schedules, more consumers shopping online and growth in telemedicine.

How It Works:
The infographic below highlights the member journey from registration to driving the vehicle to payment. The yellow steps represent the registration process to apply for a car share program. This only needs to be done once.
When someone applies to be a member of a carsharing company (such as car2go, BMW ReachNow, or Zipcar), the applicant must fulfill the acceptance criteria, which revolves around a good driving record. Once accepted, the applicant will be a part of the membership pool.
The pink steps represent the steps the member must undergo each time they want to use the service. These steps include the member finding and reserving a vehicle via app or website and driving the vehicle without ever needing to go to a rental office. For a more detailed description of the member journey, please see movmi’s blog post here.

How Round-Trip differs from Free-floating Carsharing:
While one-way and round-trip carsharing operates on the same principle that individuals use shared vehicles without having to worry about responsibilities such as  car maintenance, repairs and refueling there are differences between the two models. Generally speaking, the differences revolve around 3 factors:

Convenience 
Pricing
Fleet size and variety

Free-floating carsharing is the most flexible type of carsharing that is geared towards shorter trips (or as shared mobility experts would say: “solving the first and last mile problem”). Free-floating carsharing is flexible because members can pick up a vehicle and end their trip anywhere in the home area. For round-trips, there is less flexibility and the trips are geared towards longer hourly or multi-day trips. Round-trip carsharing requires the driver to end their trip at the same place the driver picked up the car.
The pricing scheme is reflected in the amount of convenience the driver has. Free-floating carsharing pricing offers per minute usage billing, rates range from $0.35 per minute to $0.45 per minute. Round-trip is priced hourly and daily, with hourly rates ranging from $3 to $11 hour of use. That said, free-floating does offer hourly and daily rates as well.
In general, free-floating carsharing has a larger fleet size to provide members the ultimate convenience of finding a vehicle within close walking distance at almost any given moment in the Home Area compared to round-trip. However, round-trip carsharing services offer a wider variety of vehicles for users to choose from (e.g. SUVs, minivans, economy cars) whereas a free-floating car share will only offer 1-5 different types of vehicles for members to drive.
Key Players:
Round-Trip:
Long-time players offering roundtrip services include Zipcar, which is a household name in North America, and Communauto, Montreal’s station-based program, is North America’s oldest car share. Mobility is born out of Switzerland and is used by locals. New players that recently emerged include Ekar in Dubai and Maven in U.S. Typically, companies using a round-trip model will charge members a subscription fee to access their vehicles in addition to paying for what you use on an hourly or daily basis.
One-way: 
Zipcar recently expanded its model to offer one-way trips as well but only in select cities. Autolib is a 100% electric vehicle fleet that is used by the locals in France. One of the benefits of having a one-way model for electric vehicle is that vehicles are always parked at a charging station and plugged in.
Free-Floating: 
car2go was one of the first players to see the potential in free-floating carsharing. The company has exploded in growth: boasting of over 2 million members across North America, Europe and Asia and 14,000 vehicles in 30 locations worldwide. In the past few years, players such as BMW has entered the U.S. and European market with brands such as DriveNow and ReachNow.
Future Outlook: 
The car sharing industry is predicted to have double-digit growth (34.8%) year-over-year that will reach 16.5 billion USD in projected revenue by 2024 (Global Market Insights as taken from Business Insider). Even though the industry is rapidly growing, it is still not fulfilling everyone’s transit needs on a variety of levels whether that’s accommodating to individual’s mobility needs or on a city level. Thus there are two key areas for growth:

Geographical expansion beyond large cities. Car sharing primarily services highly populated, dense cities with a more affluent demographic. Operators need to expand their service area outside the city center – especially to prevent membership churn as members move out from the city center to suburban areas. Some cities like Seattle require operators to service in certain areas outside the city center to encourage this behaviour.
Providing more social equity by offering options for demographics that cannot drive. Whether it’s a child who is ineligible to drive or a grandpa who can no longer drive, the future of car sharing can embrace more segments of people when autonomous vehicles roll out. 

In the meantime, car sharing will continue to expand its offering across the world. Business models will become more sophisticated and personalized to its members so they receive the utmost convenience for their commutes while making it as pleasurable as possible.

Peer-to-Peer Carsharing:
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Carsharing: car owners rent out their vehicles temporarily by posting ads through an online platform. The online platform will take a percentage of commission for connecting the drivers with the car owners and to cover costs such as insurance.
Overview / Market Size: 
Peer-to-peer carsharing (P2P) is often described as “AirBnb for your car”. It capitalizes on the fact that cars sit idle 22 hours a day and has found a way to increase the utilization rate so that it benefits the car owner and the driver. P2P has gained popularity in North America and Europe with many newcomers popping up in the industry. It is estimated that the peer-to-peer carsharing model has an average of 2 to 3 rentals per day (Frost & Suillivan).
History and Background:
Peer-to-peer car sharing is a relatively new model that is beginning to popularize in North America and Europe with the help of technology allowing members to make reservations and lock/unlock vehicles at the touch of their fingertips and the increasingly acceptance of the sharing economy. Another key factor to increasing popularity is the ability to read reviews about the car owner and renter to establish trust in the service.
How it works:
P2P gives car owners the benefit of earning revenue on their vehicle when it would have otherwise sat idle. This helps them reduce their cost of car ownership. Renters can also benefit with lower prices because they do not have to pay for overhead costs typically incurred with car rental agencies (office space, employees, etc.).
The car owner applies to be on a platform such as Turo and Getaround and, once approved, post an advertisement of when people can rent their car. The car owner or company will set a price for how much the renter needs to pay with prices advertised usually by hour or by day. People who want to rent the vehicle need to apply as well and be approved into the membership base (their driving record is check). A member will make a request to the car owner where the car owner can accept or decline the request. Depending on the company, physical keys may be handed off between owner and renter or renters receive a special “technology key” to unlock the vehicle for the reservation time period (usually done via app).
It should be noted that rental rates significantly vary: from as little as $10 USD per day to over $250 USD per day. Depending on the company operator, the company will take a commission anywhere from 10% to 40%
Key Players in Market: 
Turo is an American-based company that offers drivers over 800 different makes and models on its platform. Turo has presence more than 4,500 cities and 300 airports across the U.S., Canada, and U.K. Turo is a technology-light solution where car owners post an ad to rent their vehicle and interested rents make a reservation request. If accepted, the car owner and renter meet in person to exchange keys.
Getaround also offers P2P services in the U.S., Canada and U.K – but offered in fewer cities compared to Turo. Getaround eliminates the need for physical key exchange by allowing renters to unlock the vehicle with a special electronic key via app.That said, car owners must pay $20 monthly subscription fee for the telematics box. Getaround recently teamed up with Uber that allows non car owners to drive other people for extra cash (Turo). Other players in the market include carzapp, Koolicar, GoMore, Drivy, tamyca and Sharoo.

Future: 
Peer-to-peer carsharing is still a relatively new concept. Although the widening acceptance of shared economy and smartphone technology enables the P2P car sharing industry to grow, there are still barriers. Since it is new to the market, many U.S. and Canadian personal auto insurers do not allow for commercial use. As well, with rising insurance costs this passes down onto drivers. Perhaps as more people become aware of P2P and use the service this will create more actuarial data which will, in turn, make insurance companies more comfortable to offer these products.

Bikesharing
Key Terms:
Bike sharing: Similar to car sharing, members access bicycles on an as-needed basis. Depending on the companies rules, members can either use it for one-way trips, round-trips or only for certain communities (e.g. university). Bikeshare operators will look after the maintenance of the bicycle
Dockless bike sharing: On demand service, where the member picks up the vehicle and can leave the bike anywhere.
Electric Bike sharing: Bicycle that have an electric motor that reduces the amount of effort the rider needs to give. These bikes can be ideal for cities with hills.
Overview / Market Size: 
Similar to other shared mobility programs, technology allowed bike sharing programs to evolve so that people could easily reserve a bike and easily find a place to drop it off. The first modern bike sharing system launched in the United States was in 2010. As seen in the graphic below, there was 28 million trips taken in the United States in 2016, a 25% increase from the year before (NACTO 2016).

According to NACTO, the “number of bike share systems…has steadily increased year-over-year, from four systems in 2010 to 55 systems in 2016” (NACTO 2016). Not only have the number of systems increased but the types of systems are starting to change too from station based to dockless. Over the course of one year, from 2016 to 2017, investment funding for dockless bike share programs grew from $174 million to $735 million.


How it Works: 
People apply to be a part of a bike sharing program, applying to certain programs that may be on a per minute, daily, monthly or annual basis. Depending on the membership type, the price per minute will vary. The average daily pass cost $7.77, $28.09 per month for monthly memberships and $62.46 per year for annual memberships according to a 2012 survey of 20 U.S. public bike sharing programs (Shaheen S., Martin, Chan, Cohen & Pogodzinsiki). Some states offer subsidies based on income (see figure below).

Once approved into the program, the member searches for a bicycle via smartphone app to see the nearest one. The member can place a hold (reserve) the bicycle and unlock it with a unique specific PIN via smartphone. The member takes the bicycle and either locks it back into a docking station or elsewhere (depending on operators rules).
Key Players in the Market:
Hangzhou, China has by far the largest bike share system in the world, tallying somewhere between 66,500 and 78,000 bicycles across 2700 stations ((listofbiggestbikeshare).  Shanghai and Taiyuan China are two cities with large bike share programs as well. To put in perspective how large China’s bike sharing industry is, there were more bike-sharing rides in China in the first quarter of 2017 than all bike-sharing rides combined in all of North America. Mobike and Ofo are the two major players in China’s market with sights on expanding to the United States and Europe.
Velib is a bike share company focusing in Paris, France with approximately 20,000 bikes and over 1200 stations in their fleet. Motivate is the dominant player in the U.S. market with 63% market share. That said, the market is becoming fiercely competitive with new entrants such as LimeBike and Spin.
Future:
The bike sharing industry will continue to grow. Other shared mobility players are looking into the space, such as DiDi (China’s largest ride-hailing company) announced plans to offer bike sharing (CNBC). With the significant growth in investment funds, this further indicates the industry will grow; however, it remains to be seen if dockless bikes will be a feasible business model due to the operational challenges and theft.

Ridesharing / Carpooling
Key Terms:
Ride Sharing/ Carpooling: The driver picks up passengers en route to similar destinations. Ride sharing and carpooling is not intended for profit – but rather to offset costs such as fuel and maintenance costs. Carpooling can be used for short or long distance trips.
Overview / Market Size: 
One contributing factor for traffic congestion is because many cars only contain one passenger. In Canada, 83% drove alone compared to only 17% who commuted to work by car, truck or van (Canada Census). Carpooling helps increase the number of passengers per vehicle which helps takes vehicles off the road (and also reduces carbon emissions). It is estimated that if everyone carpooled once a week that traffic would be reduced by 20% (Statistic Brain). According to Shaheen, Cohen and Zohdy’s Shared Mobility Primer (Shaheen, Coehn & Zohdy), there is approximately 638 ridematching services in North America, offline and online. Of the total, only 24 programs span both countries. The United States held 401 of the total ridematching services and Canada had 261.
History & Background:
The idea of carpooling came to the United States in the 1940s as a rationing tactic (Ridesharechoices). Companies such as 3M and Chrysler were the forerunners to provide incentives to its employees to use carpooling, of which, other companies still do today. Carpooling has struggled to gain mass adoption for commuting routes for a variety of reasons, some of which include: personal safety concerns, lack of flexibility or control and effort required to organize a carpool (Transport Canada).
Key Players in the Market:
Blablacar is the world’s leading long distance carpooling services that connects drivers with empty seats to people traveling the same way. The company focuses on building a social community that builds bonds so that the trip is more than just getting from point A to point B. To date, Blablacar is worth approximately $1.5 billion (Techcrunch), providing services primarily in Western Europe but expanding into Russia, Eastern Europe and Brazil. They are also currently testing short-trip commutes with BlaBlaLines.
PopaRide is a carpooling marketplace for long-distance trips that primarily plans trips for the Canadian market and some major United State routes. This Vancouver-based startup has helped drivers and passengers share over 3 million kilometres since 2014.
For shorter commutes, Scoop helps people with their weekday commutes by pairing up trips the night before with drivers and passengers. It uses an algorithm to figure out the best matches and routes. GoKid goes after a niche market by helping busy parents coordinate rides for their children. To make the experience even better for all drivers and passengers, GoKid works with schools to match children with their peers so matches can be made by distance, grade and interest.
Future: 
Carpooling for commuter routes is unlikely to gain significant traction in certain states and provinces in Canada and United States. It’s hard to meet the delicate balance of supply and demand (i.e. having enough drivers and passengers) and carpool users have to overcome other challenges such as finding convenient pickup and drop off points with large city dispersity. There’s also a trust factor and the variability in driver/passenger experience – everyone has their own preferences on the ideal commute (silence or conversation, etc.) If carpooling is to be successful in these markets, these barriers will need to be overcome.  
That said, route planning to bring drivers and commuters together is becoming more sophisticated with the help of algorithms. Algorithms yields to optimized route planning that improves the drivers and passengers experience. Longer distance commutes pose a better outlook as these are routes are infrequent to the user and more tolerance is usually accepted for the discussed barriers.
WIth the help of this technology, companies such as Moia by Volkswagen, Chariot by Ford and Wunder are using this to provide carpooling services – but in a professional way. Instead of a private person sharing the ride with his/her neighbours, Moia, Chariot and Wunder supply minivans with professional drivers that will pick up 6-12 people to their destinations. This growing service is referred to as microtransit (aka Demand Responsive Transit Systems), which can be found under Shared Mobility & Technologies section.

Ride-hailing:
Key Terms: 
Ride hailing: On-demand service where someone picks you up and drives you to desired location.
Transportation Network Companies: uses an online platform that connects passengers with drivers.
Overview/Market Size: 
The ride-hailing industry has experienced the most disruption out of all shared mobility options for the past 10 years. For decades, ride-hailing was primarily controlled by the taxi industry but there were common issues with the service:

consistently and quickly reserve a cab,
expensive transportation option that did not always get you from point A to point B quickly,
paying by cash or credit card takes time and can be frustrating

This allowed new entrants such as Uber and Lyft to disrupt the market by limitlessly adding available cars to hail, seamless payment integration and transparency with route-driving and two-way feedback review loops to ensure the driver and member have a good experience.
Key Players in the Market:
Uber is the market leader in industry, operating in 633 cities worldwide, but is slowly losing market share. There were numerous negative public stories involving Uber which include: a sexual harassment case launched by an independent U.S. investigation, the Uber board firing the CEO, and Uber losing its license to operate in London, UK, Alphabet Waymo launched a $2.6 billion lawsuit against Uber for stealing trade secrets due to its major executive organizational rehaul.  Uber is trying to recover from all these scandals and recently made a deal with Softbank Group to increase Uber’s cash reserves and prevent Lyft from teaming up with Softbank (Fortune)
DiDi Chuxing is China’s largest ride-hailing operator and is trying to achieve global dominance. DiDi has expanded rapidly into Europe and Africa by partnering with Taxify. In 2018, they bought controlling stake in the company 99, which is Brazil’s largest startup rideshare company (https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/3/16846118/didi-chuxing-99-brazil-acquire-ride-share). Late in 2017, DiDi raised $4 billion to accelerate its’ global expansion by focusing on AI and smart transportation solutions and by continuing to diversify international operations and partnerships.
Lyft is Uber’s rival in the U.S. market. Currently Lyft operates in 300 cities and is looking to expand into Canada as of December 2017. Lyft has formed a strategic alliance with three other ride-hailing companies (DiDi, GrabTaxi, and Ola) to gain worldwide presence in Southeast Asia, India, China and the U.S. This strategic alliance allows them to reach 50% of the world’s population.
Future:
The ride-hailing is expected to grow significantly. Goldman Sachs predicts that by 2030, the ride-hailing industry will be worth $285 billion (Marketwatch). It is unclear who the market leader will be in the long-run and if there will be room for smaller players to compete in local markets. As TNC’s such as Uber and DiDi continue to gain dominance in the ride-hailing market, this also threatens the taxi industry as a whole.

Shared Mobility & Technologies 
Microtransit (Demand Responsive Transit Systems)
While car sharing, ride-hailing, bike sharing and even most carpooling rides, give more flexibility and convenience for commuting, the problem with these shared mobility types is that they do not transport many people per vehicle. Microtransit (aka Demand Responsive Transit Systems) tries to solve this problem by using dynamic shuttles that take 6-8 people per vehicle. Customers can pre-book their seat using an app or website and get dropped off nearby to their desired end location. Microtransit can be setup in a variety of ways depending on certain factors such as: route type (fixed or flexible), how heavily its integration with other transportation options and type of driver (employed, crowdsourced or autonomous vehicle).
Bridj is a public transport service that uses a demand responsive transit platform which currently operates in Brisbane, Australia and Boston, Massachusetts. It uses a data-centric approach that anticipates where and how passengers want to move by offering pop-up bus services according to the needs of the city. It uses real-time traffic data and passenger inputs to get passengers from point A to point B the fastest – it will dynamically change the route on-the-fly to do so. Other examples of microtransit operators include Ford Chariot, Moia by Volkswagen, moovel by Daimler and Wunder.
Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is a concept that enables users to plan their transportation routes using various modes of transportation in a seamless, frictionless way. To achieve MaaS this requires the collaboration and cooperation of various stakeholders: from public transportation providers to private operators in the carsharing, ride hailing, and bike sharing fields. While MaaS is more than just an app, users will use “aggregator apps” that specialize in integrating various mobility service providers (such as car2go and Uber) onto one screen interface. This allows users to know where the nearest car share or ride hail vehicle is among multiple providers and can also help with complex route planning to know what’s the quickest or cheapest way to get to their destination, using various modes of transportation.
Currently on the market, moovel allows users to plan trips using buses, trains, carsharing, and taxis. Urbi users can use their app to use car sharing, scooter sharing or ride sharing services. Free2Move aggregates car sharing companies such as car2go and BMW ReachNow.
Whim, which services all of Finland, integrates a variety of transportation modes including: public transportation, taxis and car sharing. With Whim, users receive discounts on transportation modes if they opt in the subscription which can be highly cost effective for frequent commuters. Users can also use the pay as you go method and use Whim for route planning services. Whim is a service of MaaS Global that embodies a user-centric approach to drive the company. This approach paid off as Whim won the top award for Best Mobile Service in Finland for its user-friendly design, useful features and high quality service development (MaaS Global).
The Future Of Shared Mobility 
There are more shared mobility options at people’s fingertips than ever before. With blockchain technology, machine-learning, and autonomous vehicles starting to hit the roads, the industry is going through more rapid changes than in the last 100 years. For many people, their daily commuting routine is going to change dramatically. That said, there are many cities and areas that cannot provide these services due to geographical layout, density,  income and other factors. Some types of shared mobility such as car sharing and ride hailing are usually geared towards people with higher disposable incomes and are fully mobile – meaning that others will less disposable income and need additional mobility assistance are unintentionally excluded.
Around the world though, public transit and shared mobility providers are joining forces to make mobility services more inclusive. This type of partnership provides good balance because privately run shared mobility companies such as car2go and Uber push the envelope of transportation where public transit ensures the mandate of providing inclusive transportation and options to everyone is upheld. With pressing issues such as congestion, carbon emissions, and rising populations it is imperative that these two parties work together to create the next generation of transportation so cities are livable around the world.

The purpose of this paper is the discussion of the environmental effects of a free-floating car-sharing system operating in Ulm, Germany. The system, called car2go, allows users to take and leave vehicles at any point within the city limits. Thus opposed to traditional car-sharing, there are no fixed stations and in particular one-way trips of any length are possible without a booking requirement. Since this is the first free-floating system in operation, there is as yet no associated empirical research. Based on primary data from a survey, a model was developed to forecast the environmental impact of car2go. The prognosis considers the period of five years after the launch of car2go in 2009 and indicates a CO2-reduction per average car2go-user. In addition, more than a quarter of the survey respondents stated that they may forgo a car purchase if car2go was offered permanently. By reaching a greater share of citizens than traditional systems, the results indicate that free-floating car-sharing systems could contribute to reducing private vehicle ownership in cities.

According to preliminary analyses, the collected data allows to clearly identify the different
user-groups and motivations of station-based and free-floating car-sharing members in both
socio-demographic variables and travel behaviour. Moreover, using the wealth of diary data, it
can be observed, when and how members of the different survey groups use specific transport modes.

Ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing Technology Co. on Thursday debuted its own branded bike-sharing service in Chengdu, ratcheted up the battle to control one of China’s hottest shared-economy sectors.
Just last October, talks got underway over a possible merger between the leading players – Mobike and Ofo – in bike sharing, which quickly caught fire when it started about two years ago in China. But the talks spun apart.
Didi is the largest shareholder in Ofo, with a 25% stake. But its move to pitch its own turquoise-colored bikes in the capital of southwest Sichuan province signals the competition for China’s riders may be far from over.
Orange Mobike and canary yellow Ofo have already burned through billions of dollars, offering deep discounts and other enticements to try to woo loyal customers who rent bikes via their smartphones.

Though late to the race for market share, Didi hopes to win over customers to its Qingju brand by not requiring an initial deposit to start riding, as is common in the sector. In addition to its stake in Ofo, it also bought cash-strapped Bluegogo.
That gives it three stakes in the bike-sharing sector, where it hopes its car-hailing passengers will want to go their last mile to work or home on one of its bike options.
Didi dominates the car-hailing sector, after a vicious price war against the China unit of Uber Technologies Inc., which ended in an August 2016 merger.
Didi launched a comprehensive bike-rental platform within its car services app, allowing riders to access services offered by Bluegogo, Ofo, and now Qingju.
Didi also stands to benefit from jumping into the rental-bike race by gaining access to valuable data from bike riders.
Adding bike riders to the 20 million car-hailing orders it handles every day, Didi’s pool of user data could become equivalent to the country’s largest e-commerce giant Alibaba Group.
Didi said its Qingju bikes will replace some damaged Bluegogo two wheelers in Chengdu.
Late last year, Didi joined hands with Mobike’s top investor Tencent Holdings to push forward a merger between Ofo and Mobike amid growing investor interest in seeing an end to the discount-price wars. But the proposed merger, which would likely have granted Didi greater control over the new company, was blocked by managements of both Mobike and Ofo.

Tech giants are battling fiercely in the bike-sharing market in a bid to access more users.
Alibaba last year has invested in two smaller bike-sharers — Hellobike and Youon Bike — and invested $100 million into Ofo last June. The e-commerce company is seeking to increase its investment in Ofo to get greater say in the company’s management, sources said.
But Ofo’s plan to invite fresh funding has been blocked by Didi as conflicts between the pair escalate due to disagreements on Ofo’s operations, sources close to the matter told Caixin. Meanwhile, rival Mobike has recently completed another funding round of about $1 billion, Caixin has learned.
An Ofo source said Didi had promised not to directly offer bike-sharing services when it became Ofo’s strategic investor. But Didi denies it made such an agreement.
Business registration documents showed that Didi set up two companies in August and September 2017 with core business of bike and electric bike rental services.

A bike-sharing service plans to bring as many as 250 rent-able bicycles to downtown Sioux City as early as March.


Sioux City would be the first Iowa community and potentially the first Midwestern city to serve as a location for the rapidly expanding company LimeBike, which launched in June 2017 and currently operates in more than 40 communities across the United States.


The Sioux City Council will vote Monday on a service agreement with LimeBike that will allow the California-based company to park its bikes on city sidewalks and right-of-way.

 Using an app and its distinct green “smart bikes,” LimeBike helps commuters locate nearby bicycles and then rent them using a credit card or PayPal.


The bicycles are free-standing and self-locking, meaning they don’t require a docking station like some other bike-sharing services and require no investment from cities.


Riders can unlock the bike either via text message or by scanning a QR code with their phone.
After their commute, they can leave the bikes at their destination once they arrive. Rentals cost $1 for every 30 minutes, with discounts available for low-income users and for students.


Gabriel Scheer, a director of strategic development with LimeBike, said Sioux City will be the firm’s first or second location in the Midwest, depending on when it starts up. He said he believes the city has the demographics, such as multiple colleges, that will make it a successful place to launch.


“We’re really excited to see this live in Iowa,” Scheer said. “We’re excited to be in cities that aren’t just coastal cities but are in the Midwest.”


Scheer said the company is still finalizing the number of bicycles it will deploy in Sioux City but estimated it could be around 250.


Sioux City invited LimeBike after a search by Downtown Partners’ Environment work group for a bicycle ride-sharing company.


City Parks and Recreation manager Angel Wallace said the panel was intrigued with LimeBike because the bicycles do not require the installation of docks, which can be expensive.


 “We did some research, and there were companies out there that were charging for docked bikes.

The costs were kind of cost-prohibitive because it would require a significant investment,” she said.


Panel member Darin Daby said he had heard of LimeBike over the summer and later had an opportunity to see the bicycles first-hand during a visit to Seattle.


“I was overall pretty impressed with the concept, and I kept snapping pictures of them,” he said.


Wallace said the bike-sharing service will support the city’s goal of providing affordable transportation and recreation opportunities.
Daby added that he believes people will use them downtown for short commutes or to finish the last leg after getting off the bus, as well as for recreational riding on the city’s trails.

Production costs for electric vehicles (EVs) are falling, EV drivers are enjoying savings on fuel expenditures, and numerous governments remain committed to their growth longer term. As EVs narrow the gap in costs versus internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, they are poised to play a crucial role in keeping oil demand growth in check by the middle of the next decade. Growth in EV sales comes on top of increased fuel efficiency of the car fleet. The combination of more stringent fuel economy and progressively more EVs on the road should displace an enormous 13 million barrels per day (mbd) of global liquids demand by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
In the IEA’s recent World Energy Outlook, its New Policies Scenario—which takes into account government commitments and pledges—says EVs will reach enough critical mass to bring about a tipping point in oil demand in the transport sector by 2030.

EV sales will rise by 50 percent each year from now until the beginning of next decade, and, according to the IEA, some 50 million EVs will be on the road globally by 2025.

Through 2025, EVs are expected to have only a marginal impact on oil demand, according to the IEA. Even so, the growth in sales will still be staggering. EV sales will rise by 50 percent each year from now until the beginning of next decade, and, according to the IEA, some 50 million EVs will be on the road globally by 2025, thanks in part to declining battery costs (see below).

The number will continue to rise significantly, reaching 280 million by 2040, cutting oil demand by 2.5 mbd. In a reflection of how much expectations have changed recently, the IEA had forecast 150 million by that point a year ago. EVs will make the biggest splash in China, which will be home to 50 percent of the world’s total. Even though China looks to be the leader in this area, others have indicated firm commitments to electrification (see below).

The growth in EVs is coinciding with more stringent fuel efficiency standards that will curtail oil demand growth. This combination, the IEA says, will displace some 13 mbd demand by 2040. In the Current Policies Scenario, which assumes no changes in government policies, oil demand would average 122 mbd in 2040, compared to 109 mbd in the New Policies Scenario. In the road transport sector, oil demand grows by 7.6 mbd from 2025 through 2040 under Current Policies, but at only 1 mbd under New Policies.
IHS Markit: Watch for connection between autonomy & electrification
Like the IEA, research firm IHS Markit sees radical changes in the car fleet over the next couple of decades. By 2040, EVs will make up 30 percent of new cars sold in the U.S., Europe, China, and India, compared to one percent in those markets now, IHS said in a report released this week called Reinventing the Wheel. The aggressive penetration will be the result of city and country efforts to fight pollution, tighter fuel efficiency standards, and lower battery costs.
“When we have cheaper batteries, it will make more sense for consumers to move to electric cars,” Tom De Vleesschauwer, transport and mobility practice leader at IHS Markit, told The Fuse.

“What is really important here is the connection between electrification and autonomy. When you put those two together, you get very low cost per mile.”

Not only will electrification grow, but consumers will also change how they travel. Instead of owning vehicles, an increasing number of consumers will instead buy “mobility,” which includes services such as ride-hailing.
Autonomous vehicles are expected to contribute greatly to the “mobility-as-a-service” trend—but will also become part of new vehicle sales after 2030. Even though car ownership will decline, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) will continue to rise. The higher VMT will not necessarily lead to a boom in oil demand: The growth of electrification and autonomy may instead loosen oil’s stranglehold on the transportation sector.
Mobility services will lead in linking electrification and autonomy, given that lower costs of electricity, the ability to easily charge fleets, and simpler maintenance will benefit companies. “What is really important here is the connection between electrification and autonomy. When you put those two together, you get very low cost per mile,” said De Vleesschauwer. “That is a profitable model for mobility companies and acceptable for consumers, particularly those who now can’t afford their own cars. Driverless and electric mobility services will be the biggest change.”

More oil still needed
Although the outlook for EVs and overall changes in the transportation sector is improving quickly, the importance of oil in the coming decades should not be diminished. IHS sees oil demand reaching 115 mbd by 2040, up 17 percent versus today’s levels, as ICE vehicles still make up more than 60 percent of new cars in the latter part of the outlook. The IEA sees total liquid demand in its New Policies Scenario also rising throughout the same timeframe.

Although the outlook for EVs and overall changes in the transportation sector are improving quickly, the importance of oil in the coming decades should not be diminished.

Both outlooks do provide scenarios in which oil demand is lower than it is today, but they do not see them as the likely outlook. The IEA highlights some sober points regarding the oil market.
The oil industry’s global capital expenditures is still well below its peak in 2014, and conventional fields are declining by 2.5 mbd each year. At the same time, lower prices over the past few years have helped demand grow by 4.8 mbd from 2015-17. These factors are setting the market up for a price spike in the medium term.
Nonetheless, it’s encouraging to note that new technologies and regulations will keep oil demand from being significantly higher than it would be without them. Trends that are emerging now are likely to contribute to substantial impacts in the coming decades. “When these new technologies—autonomy and electrification—start aligning, we will see their effects grow in magnitude,” said De Vleesschauwer.

TEDx Talks: Emily Castor makes the case that ride and car sharing are not only a promising transportation alternatives–especially as the urban population continues to grow worldwide, but such examples of collaborative consumption are transformative agents for our economy and culture that increase personal freedom and move us closer toward the sharing economy. Emily Castor believes authentic communication can build meaningful communities around transportation. Emily is an original Lyft team member who has helped develop the ride sharing service into what it is today as the Director of Community Relations. Along the way, she honed her expertise in the shared economy through work with Congress, political candidates, and Universities. She learned the importance of having a presence on social media, and has turned her social presence into grassroots mobilization and community outreach. From here, she is working to pass laws on Capitol Hill, and encourage policy makers to adopt ridesharing as an environmentally-conscious and community-based alternative form of transportation. In her free time, Emily hosts Collaborative Chats, a monthly panel discussion for citizens, entrepreneurs, academics, and thought leaders to build community and discuss emerging issues of relevance to the sharing economy. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

When constructing the ideal schedule, travel time can easily be overlooked. As a result, students always find creative new ways to get across Grounds to class. One mode of transportation that has become increasingly more common is the Boosted board.
Boosted boards are a specific brand of electric skateboards. At their top speeds, they can reach 12 or 13 miles per hour. The charge lasts about seven to eight miles.
“Realistically, for most people using the mid-speed level … it gets you anywhere from eight or nine miles on a good day,” said Yash Tekriwal, a HackCville staff member and fourth-year College and Commerce student.
Borne out of HackCville, Boost Cville creates an easily-accessible electric skateboard ride share program for all students. Boost Cville is located on Elliewood Avenue — convenient for students living both on- and off-Grounds.
“It’s essentially our version of bike share in some ways, but instead for Boosted boards,” Tekriwal said. “For us, Boosted boards are an easier way to get around Charlottesville specifically as a city. The terrain is really good for a board.”
“It’s a great sustainable form of transportation,” said Allison Garrett, a HackCville staff member and fourth-year College student. “But electric skateboards are really unaffordable for the average college student. Boost Cville aims to provide electric skateboards at a cheaper rate for students to rent.”
If you have never skateboarded before, Boosted boards are easy to learn. In fact, Tekriwal cites the Boosted board’s ease of use as a leading factor in the creation of Boost Cville. Tekriwal and fellow HackCville member Daniel Willson got their own personal Boosted boards, but neither knew how to skate. They were able to learn within 10 minutes.
“We thought about the ease of learning it and also the amount of fun we had being able to go around the City relatively quickly,” Tekriwal said. “We thought about how we could get more people doing this rather than just getting our friends on it all the time, and we thought we could make a little Boosted board share.”
 
Boost Cville includes a free helmet rental with the board rental. While the company emphasizes the ease of operating the Boosted board, they also stress the importance of knowing turn signals, riding in the bike lane and wearing a helmet for safety purposes.
Garrett assures new riders will be given resources to feel prepared before their rental.
“We send out an email with all of the information you need for a new rider,” Garrett said. “We do a free 30 minute lesson for each new customer in which we show them how to ride a skateboard [and] how the remote works.”
“They’re pretty safe, as long as you’re being careful about where you’re going on the road,” Tekriwal said.
Boost Cville provides an alternative form of transportation for students getting across Grounds, the company also makes it easier for students to explore other parts of Charlottesville.
“A lot of people talk about how there’s a gap between the University of Virginia and the Charlottesville community,” Garrett said. “I think Boost Cville is really aiming to bridge that gap by providing students with a form of transportation to help them explore Charlottesville.”
Garrett recommends a day pass to explore the Downtown Mall and IX Art Park. Tekriwal said Boost Cville has been most popular for dates or for adventures with friends downtown or to the Belmont area, but he personally benefits most from on-Grounds transportation.
“The biggest advantage to me has actually been that it makes going to and from class a lot faster,” Tekriwal said. “It was fast to go down the road on a board, and I could take that board with me inside the classroom and just pin it up against the wall, which is pretty convenient.”
Boost Cville runs out of HackCville on Elliewood Ave. The company rents out Boosted boards for one hour, two hours or day passes. The price ranges from $10 for one hour to a $25 day pass. You can buy a pass from their website. After purchasing a pass, the company sends an email.
“From there, you can make an inquiry for the actual rental and the time you want the rental for,” Tekriwal said. “If anyone wants to inquire for other times, they’re welcome to talk to us because our emails are also on the website.”
For those who are interested in checking out the Boosted boards, Boost Cville will host demo days in the spring.
“It’s been a fun project for us to work on, and fun to see how people react to it,” Tekriwal said. “We’re excited to see how it works when the weather gets warmer.”

The sharing economy is an emerging phenomenon that shapes the cultural, economic, and social landscape of our modern world. With variations of the concept of the sharing economy emerging in so many fields, the area of shared mobility – the shared use of a motor vehicle, bicycle, or other mode that enables travellers to gain short-term access to transportation modes on an on-demand basis – has developed as the forerunner of the transformation to be expected in other areas. This article examines how the sphere of personal mobility has been affected by the growth of sharing economy. It contributes to the growing body of shared mobility literature by uncovering innovative mobility-based models that represent solutions on the intersection of shared mobility, physical infrastructure, and integrated-mobility schemes (…)
 


Mobility in the Sharing Economy
One of the perhaps most recognized and widespread applications of the sharing economy has emerged in the area of personal mobility through car sharing (Botsman & Rogers, 2010; Cohen & Kietzman, 2014). As with sharing itself, car sharing is not a new phenomenon. Car sharing emerged in the 1950s when membership was primarily motivated by economics (Shaheen et al., 1998), and it has since continued its worldwide growth (Shaheen & Cohen, 2007). With car sharing, individuals gain the benefits of using private cars without the costs and responsibilities of car ownership (Shaheen et al., 1998). Thus, instead of owning one or more vehicles, a household accesses a fleet of vehicles on an as-needed basis. Car sharing may be thought of as organized recurring short-term car rental. Individuals gain access to a car-sharing service by joining organizations that maintain a fleet of cars in a network of vehicle locations. Generally, participants pay a modest fixed charge plus a usage fee each time they use a vehicle (Shaheen et al, 1998; Shaheen & Cohen, 2013). The impacts of car sharing can be categorized as environmental, land use, social effects, and transportation (Shaheen & Cohen, 2013). Several possible typologies of car sharing have been identified (Bauwens et al., 2012; Cohen & Kietzman, 2014; Shaheen et al., 1998). For example, Bauwens (2012) differentiates between peer-to-peer car sharing, business-to-consumer car sharing, and non-profit cooperatives. Peer-to-peer (or consumer-to-consumer) car sharing implies that the fleet of cars is owned by a community. The marketplace then matches cars that are available by the owners with the prospective drivers willing to rent them. Companies such as Turo (formerly RelayRides), Getaround, and JustShareIt offer examples of peer-to-peer car sharing. Business-to-consumer car sharing means that a company owns a fleet of cars and facilitates the sharing among members. Auto manufacturers (e.g., BMW, Peugeot, Daimler), rental brands (e.g., Hertz, WeCar), and carsharing brands (e.g., Zip-car, StattAuto, GoGet) offer examples of business-to-consumer car sharing. Nonprofit cooperatives (or public initiatives) involve a local organization or community that facilitates car sharing with the goal of changing driving habits over making a profit. Organizations such as City Car Share, PhillyCarShare, and Autolib are examples of such initiatives. Another case of sharing economy that shapes the personal mobility space is ride sharing (or ride hailing –vehicle owners allowing other passengers to ride in the same vehicle to and from the same or similar destinations), with Uber being the most prominent example of a platform enabling peer-to-peer transactions (Cohen & Kietzmann, 2014). Similarly, various dynamic ride-share systems aim to bring together travellers with similar schedules and itineraries on short notice. As Agatz and colleagues (2012) note, new dynamic ride-sharing systems have the potential to provide significant societal and environmental benefits by reducing the number of cars used for personal travel and improving the utilization of available seat capacity. Overall, three factors seem to contribute to the ongoing worldwide growth in shared-use vehicle membership: i) cost savings; ii) convenience of locations, use, and access; and iii) environmental awareness (Shaheen & Cohen (2013).

Beijing was once a city of personal bicycles and domestic brands such as the heavy but reliable Flying Pigeon were all over the capital before cars and scooters began to proliferate as China quickly developed.
Today, bicycle shops are selling fewer and fewer bikes as cycle sharing becomes the norm.
“These share bikes have taken away our business”, says Chen Wei Dong, 43, a bicycle salesman in the Chinese capital.
The hire cycles he refers to largely belong to two companies and the Chinese capital now swarms with the yellow bicycles of Ofo, and the metal and orange ones of Mobike. These two firms, the dominant players both founded in Beijing, are now becoming global leaders in a newfangled business that marries technology, transportation and cutting-edge big data applications.
Public bicycle-hire schemes have appeared in cities before (think London’s “Boris Bikes”, a service initiated by then London mayor Boris Johnson in 2010), but the bicycles that Mobike and Ofo operate work differently in one crucial way: they don’t need to be docked and locked in specific places.
In Beijing, and many cities around China and the world, Ofo and Mobike bicycles can be found wherever its most recent user leaves them. Users download a proprietary app on to their phones, register an account and deposit payment (from 199 yuan, about Dh115, to 299 yuan, depending on the company). Once registered, users simply walk up to any branded bicycle, scan the QR code displayed on the bike, or input a pin, and the bicycle automatically unlocks, leaving the user to ride it away.




Typically, the companies will charge around 1 yuan per hour, using mobile payment systems, which are ubiquitous in China, but costs can vary according to the user, and with regular promotions. Ofo is the older of two, founded in 2014, and now operates over 10 million bikes in 250 cities across 21 countries. Ofo is valued at US$3 billion.
Its major rival is Mobike, founded a year later, and which has around 100 million users and supports about 25 million rides a day, and is similarly valued to Ofo. In June 2017 Mobike raised $600 million from Chinese tech major Tencent. The American chip maker Qualcomm is also an investor.
Ofo, meanwhile, raised $700m in a funding round in July led by Tencent rival Alibaba.

Together the two bike-share companies have raised a combined $2.2bn of capital. But will they generate returns?
When asked about yearly revenues Ofo declined to give figures but said it has been making profits in some cities already, insisting bike rental fees is and will remain its main source of income.
Eden Ding, vide president at Panda Capital, a venture capital firm based in Shanghai, and his partners chose to invest in Mobike, over Ofo, in April 2016. “Ofo took an operational approach to their business,” he says. “Their strategy was to use conventional bikes [no GPS, no smart locks, no weather-resistant frames or solid tyres] and place them densely throughout the city”.
Mr Ding says that Mobike, on the other hand, is a “product-focused company” using better materials and incorporating a smarter design, with smart locks (Ofo uses a pin system and manual locks instead of the QR code-enabled smart lock of Mobike), and a built-in generator that charges the GPS when it’s ridden.
 
But why invest in Mobike in the first place? Mr Ding says based on his firm’s calculations, he predicts Mobike will turn a profit in less than three years, and that Mobike’s superior product helps to weather long-term costs of keeping their bikes in public use, and fulfilling a “huge demand for short-distance commute solutions in China”.
Both companies in fact aim to solve what is known as the “last mile” problem, whereby people need to travel from their homes and offices to subway and bus stations. Bicycles offer a cheap and environmentally friendly solution for such short-distance commutes.
Analysts believe that significant income generation will not come from collecting rental fees but from other avenues. One is brand cooperation; offering coupons for a store that is on a rider’s route (Mobike already works with McDonald’s, for instance). Advertising, on wheels, could be another revenue source. Money lending is another – the two companies hold hundreds of millions of yuan in user deposits.
Data is also a potentially valuable resource as the bikes track how they are being used. Mobike shares its data with city planners and public transport agencies, and has its own AI platform, Magic Cube, to interpret the data each of its bikes collect as they track their use.
There are over 8 million Mobikes in service, in 200 cities in 13 countries worldwide, all connected to the firm’s cloud in the world’s largest mobile IoT network, it says.
“The AI platform enables us to integrate and analyse hundreds of variables including weather, time of day, location, crowd patterns, and supply and demand trends, resulting in highly accurate predictive models that can be used to enhance operating efficiency,” Mobike says.
Such data can be used to help cities optimise existing public transportation systems as well as plan new infrastructure, such as bike lanes, Mobike says.
Joe Xia, the co-founder of Mobike, who previously worked as a software engineer, has said that bicycles are just a part of a bigger vision he is exploring. Electric bikes and car-sharing are on the cards. Mobike has a car-sharing unit and China’s FAW car company has a 10 per cent stake in the new venture, and will provide electric cars for a pilot project, he says. Mr Ding, meanwhile, believes Mobike has a lot of potential across the entire transportation ecosystem.
But Mobike will not have it all its own way. Ofo has Didi Chuxing, China’s enormous Uber-beating car-hailing service, as an investor and the two companies are exploring how to integrate their respective services.




As with Didi Chuxing, which was born of a merger between the two rival ride-hailing services Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache, many believe that in the long run Mobike and Ofo may merge.
For now both companies are expanding aggressively, and believe rental fees alone are enough to make them profitable businesses if they stopped spending on expansion. Zhang Yanqi, Ofo’s operations boss, has said that China alone could support 300 million rides a day, up from its current 50 to 60 million per day.
But there is a downside; as more and more bikes hit the streets, they add to the urban chaos, with riders leaving them more or less anywhere.
Rush-hour users in Beijing park them in public-bus lanes, leaving them for street attendants to pick up and move aside. Rows of bikes, some of them toppled over, crowd the sidewalks, leaving pedestrians little space to walk.
And spare a thought for the traditional bicycle sellers – The National found bicycle shops across Beijing reporting major sales declines. It seems bike sharing is the future for China’s cycling masses.

We hope the government of India makes BS VI fuel available across India from the year 2020. In addition, a complete range of crash test requirements will also be implemented in phases, for four-wheelers, which would also have to be concluded by 2020. Huge investments would be required for developing and bringing these new vehicle technologies in India.
The automotive industry works on long-term planning, investments and it is not possible to change processes or supply chains overnight. The sole request the industry would make is for the government to refrain from abruptly changing the decisions or timelines once they are announced. Industry fully supports the implementation of higher norms on emissions and safety, and only seeks consistency in policy, since this is integral to product planning.
The automotive industry is the backbone of Indian manufacturing, is the best example of ‘Make in India’, and contributes hugely to employment generation and to the GDP of the country.
GETTING READY FOR BS VI
The Indian automobile industry is now gearing up to leapfrog to BS VI norms in an earnest manner and is making strenuous efforts with a lot of investment including harnessing a lot of skilled manpower resources as well as technology.
It is not an easy norm to achieve as the time available is short. The industry has been given a roadmap by the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways for manufacturing only BS VI vehicles from April 2020 and the entire industry is fully committed to meet this deadline.
BS VI development generally takes a minimum of 5-6 years because you need special engines, which have combustion characteristics with high-pressure injection. The entire development cycle constitutes several years’ process and involves designing, tuning and testing. Then, you require that special fuel injection system which has to be grafted on it as also new and complex after-treatment strategies.
All these have to be packaged into the vehicle while maintaining its safety and fuel efficiency performance, which involves extensive development and validation work. Therefore, it is wrong to think that if the technology is available in another continent then it can be replicated ‘as it is’ in India, too.
CHALLENGE OF ELECTRIC MOBILITY, ONE THAT IS CONNECTED AND SHARED
The automotive industry globally is at the cusp of major transformation. Growing concerns for the environment and energy security clubbed with rapid advancements in technologies for powertrain electrification, increasing digitalisation, evolution of future technologies and innovative newer business models like shared mobility and ever-increasing consumer expectations are transforming the automotive business.

One of the key facets of such a change are the rapid developments in the field of electric mobility, which can potentially transform the automotive industry like never before.
With an ambition to be among the top three in automobile manufacturing by 2026 (as per the Automotive Mission Plan 2016-2026), and our vision to achieve 100 percent pure EV sales in public transport and 40 percent pure EV sales in private transport by 2030, the Indian auto industry has the opportunity of a lifetime to bring out its innovative prowess through pragmatic approaches and win the challenge of this transformational wave. E-mobility is, by far, the greatest opportunity for the Indian industry to participate and emerge amongst the top in the globalised automotive world.
India has started late on the electrification path and therefore will need a strong policy to catch up and move rapidly towards the stated goal of a 100 percent pure electric technology regime.
Taking cognisance of the advancements in electric vehicle technology, global markets developments, coupled with a dire need to reduce energy demand and decarbonisation of the auto sector in India, NITI Aayog’s transformative mobility report of 2017 has set out a desirable and ambitious roadmap for pure electric vehicles by 2030 and beyond. Concurrently, the automotive industry under the SIAM umbrella is working out a roadmap for pure electric vehicles. SIAM and its members are fully supportive of this vision of electric mobility and are committed to work in this direction.
To make sure that this vision is realised, the industry, government and various stakeholders will need to collaborate and invest. Most importantly, the long-term plan for the country for such an endeavour will have to be implemented with full conviction, 100 percent commitment and total perseverance.
The policy will need to be necessarily adaptive, while at the same time must not bring sudden changes, so as to allow outcomes in a planned manner and to ensure that the necessary transformation takes place with maximum local value addition and the minimum of disruption to the existing value chain, which may have socio-economic impact in terms of industrial growth, employment and livelihood of people in the auto industry.
The likes of Uber, Ola and others will also make their own contribution in transforming the transportation sector with shared mobility. Electric vehicles, shared and connected mobility are complementary in nature. This will result in a win-win situation for all the stakeholders involved in the transportation sector. The users
will be able to commute much cheaper and safer compared to personalised transportation.
Fleet owners will maximise the resource utilisation wherein electric vehicles will pay off highest with cheaper opex cost which will offset the higher capex on electric vehicles to a large extent. Furthermore, the transportation authorities will observe reduced congestion on the road that in turn will also result in a drop in vehicular pollution in cities which will furthered by the use of electric vehicles.

The debate around ride-sharing services came to Saskatoon Tuesday, as the union representing taxi drivers descended on city hall ahead of a discussion over rules for services like Uber, Lyft or TappCar.
About 20 people gathered for the United Steelworkers rally at City Hall Square to demonstrate taxi drivers’ concerns over the possible introduction of companies like Uber and Lyft to the province.
“The only reason we are standing for two hours, losing our income on the road, is to tell the city the direction (they) are going will ruin our business,” taxi driver Hassan Abbas said.
The 17-year veteran of the industry added most drivers have a low monthly income to begin with, despite regularly working 12-hour shifts every day of the week.
He said having Saskatoon streets flooded with part-time ride-share drivers would destroy his livelihood.
“The main source of income for Uber drivers is not Uber,” he said.
“They’re not making a primary income, whereas a taxi driver spending 13 hours on the road is trying to make a living.”
Abbas said like many other drivers, he had taken a line of credit against his home to purchase a taxi plate — an item that sells for approximately $250,000 in Saskatoon, according to advocates.
He said unless city council approves rules limiting the introduction of ride-sharing services, his purchase will be worth nothing.
“I would have nowhere to go,” he said.
Abbas joined several of his colleagues in council chambers throughout the afternoon as councillors on the transportation committee discussed a Saskatchewan Taxi Cab Association (STCA) proposal to allow “flex fleet” cab drivers to increase the number of taxis available at peak times.
STCA spokeswoman Shondra Boire said the part-time fleet would use private vehicles with window decals to identify their cab company, and the cars would only be called upon when the full-time taxis couldn’t keep up with demand.
“We realize we can’t service the people properly with the number of cars we have,” she said.
“Our hands are currently tied given the number of taxi licences the city gives out.”
Boire added the flex-fleet cars would have security cameras, and drivers would be subject to the same criminal background checks as other taxi operators.
City administration recommended the councillors direct staff to develop a comprehensive ride-for-hire bylaw, analyze ways to make the taxi fare system more affordable or to approve the drafting of the part-time flex fleet taxi licensing system.
Another option was to develop an independent ride-sharing bylaw that would regulate companies like Uber in the interim, until more comprehensive laws involving taxis could be drafted.
However, councillors on the committee opted to pass along recommendations to gather more research on how bylaws could maintain a “level playing field” between taxis and ride-sharing services.
If city council approves the recommendation at its Dec. 18 meeting, administration would report its findings back sometime in 2018.
Ward 6 Coun. Cynthia Block said people in Saskatoon need a more efficient, affordable option.
“I think there’s a very good chance we can find a way to develop a system that’s good for everyone,” she said.
“It won’t be the same, but it could be good for everyone.”
After several taxi managers and drivers addressed the committee to implore them to either restrict or ban companies like Uber, Ward 5 coun. Randy Donauer told them it would be a losing battle.
“We could maybe delay them by a year or two, but they’re coming,” he said, noting he won’t vote in favour of bylaws allowing ride-sharing until rules putting taxis on the same level are also in place.

The advent and success of app-based transportation alternatives to CNG auto-rickshaws and taxis in Dhaka have sent the latter groups in frenzy. Ride-sharing apps like Pathao and Uber have proven to be cheaper, user-friendly, and above all, convenient, unlike CNGs and taxis which rarely charge according to the meter or seldom agree to take a passenger on a ride.
Uber has already faced stiff criticism and outright protest in many countries from taxi drivers who claim the ride-sharing app is not a platform connecting rider and driver, but a global taxi company instead. But Uber owns no vehicles or employs drivers; the company argues all drivers have their own cars, self-employed, and work with Uber on a contractual basis.
CNG auto-rickshaws and taxis are commercial entities, and are thus subject to commercial tax. On the other hand, the vehicles enlisted on ride-sharing apps are personal vehicles and thus protected from commercial regulations.
Immediately after Uber’s launch a year ago, the Roads, Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader praised the initiative. But the next day, the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) said it did not have any permits to operate. A series of dramatic twists and turns followed where the government on one hand praised the tech-based initiative – which is in tune with the vision of Digital Bangladesh – and on the other hand call it illegal because of the lack of government approval.
But are ride-sharing platforms illegal?
Herein lies the catch, Uber, Pathao, etc are a modern-day innovation born out of ingenuity to combat the existing difficulty of commuting in urban areas. The concept of a platform which helps a private car owner connect to a commuter and establish a working relationship was not conceivable when the BRTA drafted the road transports guideline. It only extended to private vehicles and commercial vehicles. A platform which facilitated usage of private vehicles for commercial purposes was beyond anyone’s imagination.
Uber and Pathao skirt the guidelines. They have been developed outside the existing parameters, not in violation of it. This has prompted BRTA to call Uber and Pathao illegal, but after the overwhelming response to the ride-sharing apps and much discussion, met with the representatives to discuss a guideline to take into account the concept of ride-sharing.
To sum up, ride-sharing apps are perfectly legal, but use of personal vehicles for commercial use? Not so much. But things are changing with the government drafting new guidelines to adapt to the current setting.
Diversification & expansion
Uber appeared as a car-sharing service and Pathao provided motorcycles. Recently Uber has introduced UberMoto – motorcycle-based ride-sharing – and Pathao has introduced Pathao Cars.
Bahon, Ezzyr, Amarbike, Chalo, SAM – Share A Motorcycle, all offer a diverse array of services to commuters. Greater competition leads to greater innovation, lower prices, and all-around benefits for commuters and the industry.
The CNG auto-rickshaws and taxis have enjoyed a monopoly for years. The rapid popularity of ride-sharing apps has effectively thrown the outdated industry off-balance. In response, CNG auto-rickshaw and taxi drivers and owners have taken to calling the ride-sharing apps “unfair competition.”
Unfair competition or opportunity?
Hazrat Ali is a 45-year-old CNG auto-rickshaw driver. He claimed ride-sharing is cheaper because of the absence of commercial tax. He claimed the high commercial taxes on his vehicle and others have made operations costly.
But taxes are not the only concern for CNG auto-rickshaw drivers. They have a daily amount to pay to the owner which has to be met no matter what. The amount, despite being determined by the government, is often doubled or tripled, forcing CNG auto-rickshaws to charge the exorbitant fares.
Dhaka Metropolitan CNG Owners Association President Barkatullah Bulu said they also want to be a part of mobile application-based services. He said CNG auto-rickshaw owners are waiting to analyze the new policy on ride-sharing which is yet to be announced.
Bulu imagines the apps will allow CNGs to be tracked easily, which will also cut down the risk of hijacking on the vehicle. He hinted at the app offering insurance as well as several other security features.
The CNG Drivers Union, on the other hand, say they find it irrational that they were not included in ride-sharing platforms like Uber.
Dhaka District CNG Auto-rickshaw Workers’ Oikkya Parishad Secretary General Shakhawat Hossain Dulal claimed ride-sharing apps are unfair because not everyone can use smart phones.
He said: “If CNG drivers were trained, they too could have taken part. Excluding them is a gross exploitation of their economic potential.”
Rafiqul Islam is an Uber driver living in Uttara. He returned from Kuwait earlier this year, and took up driving for Uber when he found no other suitable employment. He uses his car to provide rides to commuters in need, and only occasionally rejects rides if he is running low on fuel.
He calls Uber a blessing and is thankful for the opportunity.
The popularity of shared motorcycles is mostly due to their navigability in the gridlocked roads of Dhaka. With time being of the essence, motorcycles are the preferred mode of transport in a hurry. But when comfort is preferred, shared cars win out.

According to a report by Uber, a private car remains unutilized 96% of the time. On average, 1.14 people occupy a private car. The report claimed a shared car was able to displace 9-13 cars on a daily basis.
Furthermore, Uber claimed they received over 1.5 million requests from passengers in Dhaka over the past one year. And 200,000 of them were in November alone. The report also says around 9,500 drivers make daily trips in Dhaka, and around 100 new drivers sign up with Uber every day.
Adapt, evolve, overcome
In spite of its success and popularity, Uber did not disclose its earnings over the year. Arpit Mundra, general manager of Uber Kolkata and Uber Dhaka, said they are working with the government to sort out the legal issues.
Pathao responded to the Dhaka Tribune’s queries over an email, saying it is merely a platform that allows commuters to connect to riders. They denied being a service.
According to Pathao, around 1,000 people take Pathao Car rides on a daily basis, but did not disclose the daily Pathao bike ride tally. Pathao has around 50,000 users, according to Google Play Store.
Pathao authorities also said they are working with the government to bring their operations under a clearly defined legal framework.
SAM – Share A Motorcycle and Hello CNG are currently working to include CNG in their apps.
Imtiaz Kashem, founder of SAM and managing director of Datavoxcel Ltd, is the first to design the concept of sharing motorcycle rides in Bangladesh. He said that CNGs could have been integrated in their apps, but CNG owners were not available to layout the plans and discuss terms. He also said if need be, his company would train CNG drivers.
On the topic of unfair competition, he said there is a tax imposed on the vehicle and another on a person’s income and that is all there is to it.
Policymaking
Centre for Policy Dialogue Research Fellow Towfiqul Islam Khan said there are three aspects to consider the tax and unfair competition issues – registration, income tax and route fees.
Fakhrul Islam Patwary, a chartered accountant, said taxation depends on the purpose of the vehicle. If the vehicle is used for commercial purposes, the company has to pay income tax. But if a company shows there are lesser number of vehicles registered with them, it will be able to avoid paying taxes. He urged the government to ensure the companies were providing accurate numbers of their registered vehicles.
BRTA Chairman Md Moshiar Rahman said they are currently finalising the policy on a priority basis. He said all debates will be put to rest after the policy has been formulated.

An alliance of six Sydney councils has imposed new guidelines on dockless bike sharing companies.
Inner West Council is leading the charge, giving the share bike companies three months to comply or they could face punitive action.

The alliance was formed in November when mayors from Inner West, City of Sydney, Randwick, Waverley, Woollahra and Canada Bay councils met to draft a set of guidelines to address the problem of haphazard placement of share bikes in parks and streets.
Inner West Council mayor Darcy Byrne, who convened the meeting, said it was important that one set of rules was established to protect pedestrian safety and ensure the success of bike share schemes.

Operators will have to introduce “geo-fencing” – a virtual boundary area – for their bikes, a feature that oBike has already launched in Singapore.

Under geo-fencing, users would have to park their bikes in preferred areas or risk a penalty.
A spokeswoman from oBike Australia said it would not be implementing geo-fencing technology “anytime soon as we are still in discussions with the Sydney councils on that”.
CP Lim, the head of oBike Australia, said: “We will abide by [the guidelines] to the best of our abilities within reasonable means.”

A spokesman for Reddy Go said the full implementation of geo-fencing would require “advanced technology and more investment” and there hasn’t been any agreement with the councils on how it would be financed.
Reddy Go said the guidelines are fair and that it would cooperate with councils.
It expects its competitors to also show that the “image of bike sharing in Australia” isn’t diminished.
A spokesman for the City of Sydney said while the council “supports the concept of bike share, we continue to stress our concerns about safety, redistribution of bikes and accessibility on footpaths, and have found operators to be responsive”.
The guidelines state operators must:

move bikes in dangerous spots within three hours and be proactive in the redistribution of bikes;
man a repair phone service between 6am and 9pm;
unlock bikes for council staff when requested so that they can move bikes with more ease;
deactivate broken bikes immediately and remove them within a week;
educate users about correct bike parking and the possibility of heavy penalties for offences such as not wearing a helmet;
install bells, helmets, front and rear lights, a rear reflector and a sturdy kickstand on all bikes;
have public liability insurance;
send relevant data, including the number of registered users and trip origins and destinations to councils whenever they ask for the purpose of transport and urban planning;
offer incentives to customers to relocate bikes in built-up areas;
move inactive bikes after 11 to 14 days or they are to be impounded and a fee will be charged. If the fee isn’t paid, the bike is recycled.





Customers are advised to park their share bike in an upright position, kerbside, away from buildings and bike rack spaces, and not on narrow footpaths.
The problem of share bike clutter is well-documented.
Similar guidelines have been introduced in Canberra and in three Melbourne councils.
This came after 30 oBikes were crushed by Melbourne City Council after they were impounded for getting in the way of pedestrians.

Other Sydney councils are considering their positions.






A spokeswoman from Ryde said that while the number of complaints from residents has increased in relation to share bikes being left in places like parks, they are working with the companies to address the issue.
Willoughby Council has not received any noticeable increase in complaints associated with dockless bikes and there are no shortfalls in the legislation stopping councils from impounding abandoned bikes.
North Sydney mayor Jilly Gibson said it was good for councils to work together but the issue isn’t really on her radar.
“I think we need to not overreact and throw the baby out with the bathwater,” she said.
While she agrees standard council guidelines should be in place, she said: “We need to massage and direct these dockless bikes into something worthwhile like the system they have in Paris.”

California-based smart scooter startup Scooterson has secured US$1.75 million in seed funding from Arsat Industry, a manufacturer of precision metal parts for leading automobile companies in the world.
The electric scooter startup plans to use the investment to set up own manufacturing unit and launch its first product Rolley by leveraging Arsat’s expertise aerospace applications.
A portion of the capital will also go into hiring talent, particularly engineers, for Scooterson’s R&D team in Singapore.
“The year 2017 has been a great year for us at Scooterson. With a product validation of more than US$2 million worth of pre-sales, we raised US$1.75M in our seed-round. This calendar year will be even greater with the launch of our first product in the first semester and the launch of our scooter-sharing operations in Singapore by the end of the year. Also we plan to launch a product version for emerging markets, especially in India, where our indian investors (Bhavya Khanna and Sai Anurag) are helping us get started,” the founders said in a joint statement.
Singapore-based Aditya Mathur and an unnamed angel are also investors at Scooterson.
Scooterson was founded in 2015 by Romanian national Mihnea de Vries (CEO), Deepansh Jain (CTO), and Flavius Balaj (COO).
THE NEW ROCK AND ROLL
Scooterson’s Rolley flaunts several innovative features:
Intuitive: Rolley is a gesture-controlled intuitive scooter. There’s no need for a gear shifter, nor an acceleration lever. You start as you start riding a regular kick-scooter, the gesture control system will detect your body as it moves: first kick is gear one, second kick shifts to gear two, and then simply sit for gear three.
Predictive: The Scooterson app will automatically turn on Rolley when the rider is within the activation range. The vehicles knows your daily habits and can then predict and suggest your most likely destination. Predictive routing is used by other smart features to increase energy efficiency and safety, based on riding patterns, rider profile and surrounding terrain.
Adaptive: The Scooterson app will adapt power and torque settings to perfectly match with remaining battery levels. In this way, you are able to ride at peak performance without draining the batteries before reaching your destination. The flip-side is that when the battery is low, the app will drop the settings to an energy conservation mode that will allow you to arrive at your destination before the battery dies.
Energy efficient: The more you ride Rolley, the more information the Scooterson app will gather and store in the cloud. After a while, by leveraging this data it will create a new optimised power-train profile, based on the riding patterns, your weight and surrounding terrain specifics. You can have multiple power-train profiles, optimised for better performance or for more range.
Connected: Scooterson connects to smartphones and smartwatches to display speed, battery status, ride statistics and other traffic-relevant data acquired from the cloud. The app continuously tracks the status of your scooter and connects to the cloud to receive rider’s optimised and personalised torque and power settings, as well as software updates.
Sharing: Using the app, your friends and colleagues can request access to use your Rolley. The cloud-based sharing management system will send you a notification to ask you to grant them access. The app will unlock your Rolley, pairing it with your friend’s smartphone, allowing to use all the predefined features accessible to a guest user. The system will notify your friend with the duration available to use the vehicle, and will remind them as this is coming to an end.
Multiple owners: The Scooterson app allows you, family, and friends to own and share one or more scooters. When a scooter is marked as available and a user is entering the predefined radius, the Scooterson app will notify him where to find the vehicle.
Keyless: You don’t need to worry about the safety of the scooter. Your smartphone or smartwatch acts as a key, when the device is located within the predefined auto lock-unlock range. The security mode will automatically activate when you leave a short distance from the scooter.
Chassis: The scooter is made from aerospace materials, magnesium alloys and composites and weighs only 20 Kg, which is much lesser than a normal scooter that could weigh as much as 100 Kg.
Cost effective: Scooterson can be charged by plugging in any standard power outlet. It takes about three hours to fully charge the battery. The battery can be swapped with a charged one. On full power setting, it will go about 30 miles (50 Km) with one charge. However, this may depend on rider’s weight, driving style and terrain specifics. On eco mode, it could go up to 45 miles (70 Km). All in all, the ride does not cost more than 19 cents per 100 Kms.
Exercise while riding: Since Scooterson does not have a throttle, the rider has to push with his feet until a 3.5 mph (5km/h) speed threshold. The motor assistance kicks in only over this speed. Also there is the “low power assistance” mode and the rider has to push with his feet from time to time, even beyond the speed threshold. So, there is a way to exercise a little.
Anti-theft system: Scooterson has a complex anti-theft system. The wheels are automatically blocked and the alarm goes off if moved from the parked position and you can track the vehicle using the in-built GPS feature on your mobile device if stolen.
Currently, Rolley is priced at US$2,490. It also offers a subscription-based ownership option: US$99 per month and US$999 per year options, which come with theft insurance and unlimited maintenance.
Whilst the company is headquartered in Silicon Valley, the team is scattered around the world — Romania, India, Singapore, and Norway.
Arsat Industry, with facilities near Arad in Romania, has many aerospace industry clients like Airbus, GE and Rolls Royce, and also serves huge names from other industries like Apple, Flextronics, and ABB.

“We were at Arsat offices, talking about Scooterson features and manufacturing details, and out of the blue, Arsat owner Andrei Ghinea said ‘I really like this product and I want to help you more, I want to invest’. It was an unexpected and pleasant surprise, and this is how Arsat became our largest investor so far, besides other investors from Singapore and India,” said Vries.
Vries is a serial entrepreneur and filmmaker, with 20-plus years’ experience in tech, marketing and film. In 1996, Vries launched the first internet service provider in his hometown. Later, he started directing TV ads and music videos, pioneering aerial cinematography drones.
Jain is a serial entrepreneur, who co-founded and developedShifu App, an AI-powered context-aware personal assistant application for mobile phones. A few months after attracting investment from Google executives like Amit Singhal, Shifu was acquired by Paytm for US$8 million.
Balaj has 20 years’ experience in corporate management and entrepreneurship. After succeeding in industrial construction and real estate investments in Romania, he is turning his focus into tech innovation, in the areas of electric transportation and leading the manufacturing at Scooterson.

Currently, ridesharing companies like Uber and Lyft operate in only 15 of the larger cities across the state —Auburn, Birmingham, Daphne, Gardendale, Gulf Shores, Homewood, Hoover, Huntsville, Mobile, Montgomery, Mountain Brook, Pelham, Tuscaloosa, Trussville and Vestavia Hills — but due to a lack of comprehensive, statewide regulations aren’t able to operate in all parts of the state.
Which is what Mountain Brooks-Republican State Rep. David Faulkner and Greensboro-Democratic State Sen. Bobby Singleton hope to remedy this legislative session. They’re soon introducing a bill that would create a ridesharing network across the state for companies like Uber and Lyft, and place it under the control of the Alabama Public Service Commission.
On Thursday, the pair was joined by Gov. Kay Ivey on the steps of the State House where they discussed plans for the bipartisan, statewide ridesharing legislation. They were also joined by the “Ride for Alabama” coalition, formed by supporters of the bill. More than 30 local rideshare drivers were also in attendance.

“To embrace the future, Alabama must accommodate modern transportation demands. The ability to request an on-demand ride is no longer considered a perk of being in a big city, it is an expectation no matter where one lives or work,” Ivey at the press conference. “Having consistent rules statewide for ridesharing is the sensible way to give Alabamians access to safe, consistent and efficient transportation options.”
Alabama is one of only six states that lacks statewide ridesharing regulations. If passed, the bill would allow Alabamians from not only the larger cities, but also suburban and rural communities across the state to take advantage of all benefits the ridesharing industry produces.
“Alabama has the opportunity to make the best decision for the state’s future with regard to a statewide ridesharing framework, as the passage of this bill would provide citizens from one corner to the other with the opportunity for safe and reliable transportation,” said Faulkner.
“Ridesharing creates transportation options for those with low incomes, the elderly, and people with disabilities,” added Singleton. “By increasing overall transportation access for all of Alabama, we are also creating new economic opportunities for our state.”

Ride for Alabama is made up of multiple Chambers of Commerce and third-party entities, such as Birmingham Urban League, Decatur-Morgan County Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives, the Alabama Black Chamber of Commerce, Young Alabama and the Alabama Association for the Deaf, Inc., among others.
“Embracing innovative and forward-thinking technology platforms like Lyft and Uber will continue to move Alabama forward,” said Deon Gordon, Ride for Alabama coalition member and president, TechBirmingham. “The time has come for Alabama to become the 45th state to expand these vital transportation options to all.”

People all around the world use private cars to travel to work. Most of these commuter trips are singleoccupant vehicle trips. In the U.S., for example, single-occupant trips represent approximately 77% of all commuter trips; similar percentages are found in Europe. The low vehicle occupancy rates combined with the high number of trips during peak-hours often leads to severe traffic congestion in urban areas. The resulting stress and air pollution, caused by vehicle emissions, can have serious negative health effects. To reduce the negative externalities of car travel, local governments encourage the use of public transit. Unfortunately, many suburban and rural areas are not adequately served as they lack the population density to justify public transit, i.e., the public transit is not economically viable. In cities with sprawling suburban areas, the utilization of public transit to commute to work is often low, e.g., less than 5% in metropolitan areas like Houston and Atlanta. To attract more riders from suburban areas to public transit, transportation agencies must find adequate solutions to accommodate the first and last mile from the riders’ home to and from the transit stations. Possible solutions for a transportation agency include operating a fleet of demand-responsive feeder vehicles and collaborating with local taxi service providers. In the U.S., for example, public transport providers have started collaborating with Uber and Lyft to better coordinate their service offering. While the services provided by Uber and Lyft are convenient for the riders, they are often (too) costly for the transportation agency and/or the riders. A cheaper and more environmentally sustainable alternative is to use already  existing trips as a feeder for public transit. A recent TRB report highlights ride-sharing as an important opportunity for transportation agencies to address the “last mile problem”. Deutsche Bahn (German railways) is running several pilots to synchronize bus and ride-shares to provide convenient door-to-door transportation to their travelers. The Flinc ride-sharing smartphone app will soon integrate train timetables and regional public transport schedules across Germany. In this paper, we examine the potential benefits of integrating ride-sharing and public transit. Ridesharing and public transit can, in fact, complement each other. On the one hand, ride-sharing can serve as a feeder system that connects less densely populated areas to public transit. One the other hand, the public transit system can extend the reach of ride-sharing and reduce the detours of the drivers. As such, it may help to overcome incompatibilities in the itineraries of drivers and riders and facilitate the matching process.

SEOUL (Reuters)  Hyundai Motor said on Thursday it had invested in Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab, as it seeks to expand into the region to reduce its reliance on China following a damaging diplomatic row between Seoul and Beijing.
Hyundai’s first direct investment in a ride-hailing firm gives it a “foothold” in the world’s third-biggest ride-hailing market after China and the United States, it said.
Singapore-based Grab, the biggest operator in the region’s third-party taxi hailing and private-vehicle hailing sector, has expanded to eight Southeast Asian countries.
“The deal should help raise the exposure of Hyundai Motor in the region, while responding to the future mobility market,” said Lee Sang-hyun, an analyst at IBK Securities.
Hyundai’s interest in Southeast Asia has grown since South Korean companies were targeted last year in a Chinese backlash over Seoul’s decision to deploy a U.S. missile defence system against Beijing’s objections.

The region of about 500 million people is dominated by Japanese carmakers, while Hyundai has focused on China and the United States.
CATCH-UP
Hyundai is also looking to catch up with its peers in future mobility, the personal transport innovations from ride-sharing to self-driving cars that are expected to reshape the auto industry.
While it does offer car-sharing services in the United States and Europe, until now it has watched from the sidelines as competitors like GM and Toyota have allied with ride-sharing partners.
Hyundai and Grab said they would jointly develop services in Southeast Asia, including one utilising Hyundai’s eco-friendly models such as the IONIQ Electric.
They did not disclose the value of Hyundai’s investment.

FLORENCE, SC (WBTW) – People in Florence can now use the ride-share app ‘Uber’.
The Greater Florence Chamber of Commerce says it’s worked to bring Uber to Florence for about a year and a half.
Chamber officials tell News13 Uber drivers will start off picking up people in the City of Florence.
President Michael Miller predicts as more drivers sign on, Uber may branch out to other cities like Darlington or Hartsville.
Miller says businesses and restaurants in the area requested the credit card driven app.
“We’ve been underserved for many years. We’re catching up fast and actually surpassing some of the other communities in South Carolina,” said Miller. “Different people use transportation for different things [and] different types of transportation. Taxis have their market. Uber just gives a different dimension to the ride- share type of program.”
For the last four years, Craig Anderson has been a driver for ‘Best Way Taxi’.
“Sometimes you might get a good day. Sometimes you might get a bad day,” said Anderson.
He does not think Uber will impact his business.
“The bigger cities… that is where I think Uber will work,” said Anderson.

He feels Uber drivers should have similar requirements and fees.
“You have to have a business license. You have to have the ORF sticker. All these fees to run the taxi’s and you have to do that every year,” said Anderson.
Anderson believes taxi services are a staple in the community.
“We’re going to stand our ground and keep… continue doing what we’re doing,” said Anderson. “We’re trying to expand our business up and here comes another cap company coming to Florence. I don’t think that’s right. If they can come here. Have them pay the same fees that we pay.”
Miller says people interested in driving for Uber can apply online at Uber.com.

Senior living providers are increasingly using ridesharing services to transport their residents wherever they want to go at the drop of a hat—but if they’re not paying attention, they could hit a bump in the road.
Accidents, injuries to residents, misconduct from drivers and insurance woes are all risks providers need to watch out for when striking agreements with ridesharing companies, according to John Atkinson, a managing partner at risk management firm Willis Towers Watson.
“When you’re the employer, you’re able to evaluate a driver and understand through experiences with residents how that driver does,” Atkinson said. “When you get a third-party company coming in to do the transportation, you don’t have that level of communication and ongoing training.”
When done right, however, ridesharing can be a powerful tool. Brentwood, Tennesee-based Brookdale Senior Living (NYSE: BKD), which first partnered with Lyft in the fall of 2016, uses the service in about 30 of its communities.
Residents at participating communities can hail a ride through the community’s concierge service, meaning they don’t need to have a smartphone or navigate the app themselves.
“While Brookdale manages a fleet of transportation services, Lyft is integral in giving our residents flexibility and independence at a moment’s notice,” Dana Schroering, senior communications specialist at Brookdale, told Senior Housing News.
Chicago-based senior living provider Pathway to Living also uses Lyft as another transport option for some of its residents. Pathway’s Grandbrier community in Prospect Heights, Illinois, started using the service earlier this year.
Overall, Lyft has made a big push to cozy up to senior living providers. The company is currently working with dozens of providers across the country, including Sunshine Retirement Living, Erickson Living and Life Care Services—and hopes to add more over time, according to Gyre Renwick, vice president of Lyft Business.
“Our goal is to supplement senior living providers’ current capabilities with a better alternative and eventually work towards replacing all of their transportation needs over time as our capabilities grow,” Renwick told SHN.
Navigating the risks
One of the first things a provider should do when exploring an agreement with a ridesharing company is learn more about how it does business, Atkinson said. Potential vetting topics include how the company selects drivers and how it conducts background checks.

“Make sure that the transportation network companies also conduct vehicle inspections, criminal background checks, driving record checks and offer in-app photo identification of the driver and a two-way rating system after each completed ride,” Atkinson said.
“The safety standards in place provide a transparent experience and added safety measures for the passenger.”
Insurance is another crucial component of a good deal.
“You should request your organization be named as an additional insured… on the transportation network company’s auto liability policy,” Atkinson said. “Certificate of insurance or evidence that that’s taken place would be a good recommendation.”
Because most ridesharing companies’ drivers won’t help residents in and out of their vehicle, senior living providers should also figure out which of their residents can use the service. Brookdale, for example, recommends that only its independent and assisted living residents use Lyft.

UNDETERRED by the frequent controversy surrounding bikes cluttering public spaces, more dockless bicycle sharing companies are starting to surface on the Australian market.

The GPS tracked bikes aim to offer a cheap alternative to public transport or driving, with bicycles rented at just $1.99 for half an hour, plus refundable membership fees.
While the ride-and-pay model, expansive data set and large interest earned from the    refundable membership fees are all helpful in bike sharing services making money, it appears increasing competition and vandalism are becoming too much for these companies to survive.
Evidence of the failing concept can be seen in China, where too much competition and insufficient demand has seen the development of a bicycle graveyard that is home to thousands of bikes from all of the major operators.

 I was astonished at how China’s bike sharing scheme had ballooned when I returned there in the summer. Now these remarkable @guardian photos show the boom is bust https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/25/chinas-bike-share-graveyard-a-monument-to-industrys-arrogance …
5:37 AM – Nov 25, 2017


 The images come after China’s third highest ranked bike sharing company went bankrupt, sparking questions about the future of the scheme in China and beyond.








Bluegogo reportedly went bankrupt after burning through $A119 million in venture capital churning out bikes in an attempt to keep up with the competition.
However, it appears it wasn’t enough with bike behemoths Ofo and Mobike having $A1.7 billion and $A1.2 billion, respectively.
Bluegogo chief executive Li Gang said he felt some responsibility for the failure of the company.
“As a CEO, I’ve made mistakes,” he said. “I was filled with arrogance.”

However, assistant professor Chen Lin said Bluegogo’s failure represents the bubble collapsing for shared bike services, with the model only viable for those with the deepest pockets.
“The winner-takes-all outcome is what happens to almost all internet companies in China,” he told the Financial Times.
“The size of China’s market means that the benefits of creating a large network are even more important here, and that gives bigger companies an advantage.”
These sentiments were shared by former Bluegogo employees.
“I think in internet sectors there can only be one giant. There’s nothing you can do without funding, as we saw with Uber China and Didi,” the anonymous employee said.
As for the future of bike sharing services in Australia, only time will tell who will survive.

When Zach Rogers went on his lunch break one day last week, instead of unwinding for a few minutes, he hit the streets of Palmyra looking for people needing a ride.
Rogers is one of the first Uber drivers registered in Northern Missouri, the last geographical market of the state for the app-based ride-sharing company to penetrate.
Uber and other ride-sharing companies — notably Lyft — have challenged traditional taxicab companies for viability in the transportation industry increasingly in recent years. Uber drivers utilize their own vehicles, set their own work schedule, and can drive anywhere in their designated area.
With his registration in northern Missouri, Rogers can drive people anywhere in the state of Missouri, including on long-distance trips from Hannibal to St. Louis, Kansas City, or even Branson, Mo. — five hours away.
The business is entirely app-based, with potential riders identifying their destination through the app and the nearest Uber driver summoned to take them there.
Riders create an account and enter payment information. Payment is automatic with the information on file once the ride concludes.
Rogers originally applied to be a driver in Columbia, Mo., but once Uber opened driving to the northern third of the state, he applied to drive based out of Hannibal.
“I downloaded the Uber Driver app, and most of the application process took place there. They ask (optionally) for references for your driving.
After the first part is done, they need your drivers license, insurance information, as well as vehicle registration,” Rogers said. “After confirming the vehicle is able to drive for Uber, they have to put you through a background check.
This took about two weeks to conclude, as they are pretty thorough with the process.”
Uber is fairly new in much of Missouri, with questions regarding ride-sharing regulations were resolved when Gov. Eric Greitens signed House Bill 13 into law in April allowing the businesses to operate in the Show-Me without regulations.
However, the bill requires app-based companies to conduct driver background checks and pay a licensing fee. Uber does not pay local taxes and does not have a business license on file, according to Hannibal city clerk Angel Zerbonia.
While ride-sharing service thrive in cities with a high population density, will it succeed in more rural markets?
Rogers thinks it has a chance.
“Most people do not even realize it is available here yet,” he said. “My wife and I have posted in a Facebook group three or four times advertising the arrival of Uber in the area, and each time there are a large amount of people who are just then finding out about it.”
With more exposure, he predicts business will pick up.
“I think it can be especially useful in our downtown area near the bars,” he said. “Maybe out at the (Mark Twain) casino (in La Grange) could be a good place as well.
It’s just a matter of getting everyone to know it’s out there. I try to stay active until after 2 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, and I see all kinds of taxis driving people around.”

Riders are able to rate their drivers using the app, so a potential rider can know a little bit more about the driver.
“I have had some people use the service though, and I think it went very well. With Uber you often get a level a interaction and fun you wouldn’t get with a taxi driver,” he said.
Without having to abide by a taxicab company’s policies, Rogers can do things like allow the rider to control the music. He also has snacks in his car available for riders.
According to its website, Lyft also operates in Northern Missouri through its Columbia, Mo., market.

Here, we examine the ways in which shared autonomous electric vehicles will change mobility in the US. Upcoming publications will focus on the evolution of powertrain technologies and the impact of technological change on the profit pools of the automotive-based mobility industry.


AT A GLANCE

By 2030, a substantial proportion of people in the largest US cities will have ex-changed their private cars for shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs). This move will usher in the  greatest change in mobility the US has experienced in well over a hundred years. Ultimately, we believe, it will change the world.
All Signs Point to SAEVs
A convergence of technologies—allowing for ride sharing, autonomous vehicles, and electric powertrains—enables the move to SAEVs. These technologies are progressing rapidly, and multiple pilots are underway. And consumers in cities are ready for a transportation alternative that will improve safety, access, and reliability.
Start Your Strategy Engines
Reinventing mobility will upend the status quo. Cities face challenges in urban planning and more, but those that move forward proactively stand to reap benefits. Automakers and suppliers’ long-held business models will be shaken and in some cases toppled. These companies need to take a long hard look at their position and capabilities and figure out how to succeed in a new mobility paradigm. Some companies will reinvent themselves as providers or suppliers of mobility as a service; others will become obsolete. Disruption is here, and decisive action is needed now.

(…)


We estimate that by 2030, a substantial share of the 175 million Americans who live in the nation’s largest cities will turn to SAEVs, cutting transportation costs by nearly 50%, reclaiming time instead of losing hours a day to traffic and putting up with all the expense and hassle of urban automobile ownership. SAEV fleets will account for nearly 25% of all auto passenger miles traveled in the US by 2030. Such a change will have an enormous impact on health, safety, and quality of life in cities: Traffic accidents and fatalities will be reduced by nearly two-thirds. Pollution will be drastically curtailed. Cities can repurpose millions of square feet once used for parking to new green spaces or commercial uses while securing more affordable mobility and accessibility for elderly, disabled, and low-income people.

The automotive industry has always embraced innovation and efficiency, and key players in the field have begun taking steps to use distributed ledgers in a variety of applications. These moves will place blockchain technology at the forefront of one of the world’s most significant business sectors, and revolutionize how people, and goods, are moved.
They also reflect the fact that cryptocurrency, and transfer of value, is but one small element of the blockchain revolution.
Most major automakers are exploring blockchains for a variety of uses, and some have already placed integration of the technology on their development roadmaps. Use cases include securing maintenance and ownership records as well as more advanced applications such as using blockchain to better enable self-driving features. Many are also exploring its use in the manufacturing process.



Volkswagen is perhaps the most ambitious automaker in the blockchain space. The German car giant’s partnership with the Iota Foundation is well-known, and it has made no secret of its plan to integrate Iota into future vehicles.

The first step will be the Connected Car System, scheduled for implementation in 2019, which will use Iota to securely push software updates. Many more features will later be added such as the ability for Volkswagen electric cars to charge themselves automatically, and pay via cryptocurrency.
Volkswagen has also partnered with CarVertical, a startup that has developed an Ethereum token designed to store vehicle information, such as mileage, via blockchain. This step will ensure that such data cannot be altered or lost.
A number of other blockchain-based projects are under development at Volkswagen’s Future Mobility Incubator, a research program that helps innovators from around the world develop tech ideas for transportation.
Porsche is also aggressively pursuing blockchain innovation. It is presently cooperating with XAIN, a research group from London’s University of Oxford and Imperial College to explore a variety of distributed ledger uses for its vehicles.
These include convenience features, such as enabling unlocking from a distance, or opening trunks for package delivery, as well as more substantial applications such as securely recording real-time traffic data.
One of the most advanced use cases for blockchain in automobiles is using the technology to better enable autonomous driving. Many automakers are exploring this possibility.
For example, the Toyota Research Institute is working with a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to use distributed ledgers for self-driving applications as well as ride sharing, and even shared ownership. Other carmakers pursuing similar projects include BMW, Ford, General Motors, and Renault Group.
 

To help create standards across the automotive space and cooperate on blockchain initiatives, several automakers, tech companies and related manufacturers have created the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI). MOBI members represent more than eighty percent of all global  automotive manufacturing, making MOBI one of the largest industrial consortiums ever assembled.
It is developing a range of use cases for blockchain in the transportation industry and is forging relationships with governments, universities, and other players that have a stake in bringing blockchain into transportation.
There is little doubt that blockchain promises to bring tremendous benefits to the automotive industry. This fact is a reflection of how mainstream adoption will be far more significant than the widespread use of cryptocurrency. Although implementation has barely begun, it will soon underpin virtually every aspect of modern life.

The influx of bike-sharing schemes onto the streets and pavements of Singapore has received much positive press for the contributions to a healthier and cleaner nation.
While operators oBike, ofo, Mobike and SG Bike have unleashed tens of thousands of garishly coloured bicycles across the city, regulators have also moved positively to guide the rapid growth of this industry. Unfortunately, defining limits on growth and painting yellow boxes on pavements are not enough.
The idea of bike-sharing is a terrific one: creating convenience for people, and choices other than the use of more polluting private cars and taxis, while making public transportation more accessible and more desirable at a low cost.
It has also proved a great idea for the owners of these companies. Ofo has a valuation exceeding US$2 billion (S$2.7 billion). Its young CEO owner Dai Wei became a billionaire in a span of a few years.
The business model is based on simple mathematics. Calculate the cost of a bicycle purchase, calculate its useful life – inclusive of unwanted disposal or destruction – and factor in a few office and maintenance costs. Now calculate revenue based on per hour or 30-minute pricing and expected average hours of usage per day.
It seems like the simplest of businesses with nothing but benefits for owners and users. But there are costs – hidden costs to the business that economists like to call negative externalities and free-riding (pun intended, but also apt). Avoiding these costs creates value for users, and wealth in the billions for founders such as Mr Dai.

A negative externality occurs when the use of a product or service creates costs for third parties or non-users. In the case of bike-sharing, the negative externalities are clear: Multi-coloured bikes litter the carefully crafted landscapes of Singapore, while pedestrians find themselves having to avoid randomly parked bikes or their distracted riders.

ST ILLUSTRATION : MANNY FRANCISCO

The next problem is the one of free-riding, when an individual or company takes advantage of the provision of a public good without paying for its use.
Bikes are vehicles that use public roads and public spaces for transportation and storage – in other words, parking. Cars and other vehicles do the same. To cover some of the public costs associated with roads, car owners pay registration taxes, insurance to protect against costs associated with accidents, and charges when parking in high-density areas of the city.
Bike rental companies and users pay none of these, yet happily exploit these negative externalities and free-ride on the dime of others.
But before condemning this business model too quickly, since bike-sharing is still a very new phenomenon in Singapore, let’s think of a possible end point if this free-riding continues.
The Netherlands has long been known as one of the most bike-friendly countries in the world. In a country of 16 million people, there are almost 13 million bikes.
Amsterdam Central Station is perhaps one of the largest bike-parking areas in the world. Every day, more than 8,000 bikes compete for fewer than 8,000 bike-parking spaces. This shortfall is not a function of a lack of effort from the government – rather, the Amsterdam city authorities have been striving to accommodate its legions of cyclists.
In the past 20 years, bike usage in Amsterdam has grown by 40 per cent. Public spending in the next few years on infrastructure devoted to bikes is expected to cross well over $100 million by 2020, most of which is devoted to creating bike-parking spaces. Other public funds are used to pull up to 10,000 bikes from canals across the Netherlands each year.
It is well within Singapore’s budget capacity to spend on bike infrastructure. Indeed, it would be a laudable use of public funds to do so, as it supports the shift away from polluting vehicles. But who pockets the Government’s largesse in providing bike infrastructure?
Very clearly, it is both the users of bikes and the companies that provide them. Providing benefits to a country’s populace is reasonable, but providing public benefits to private companies is equivalent to lining shareholders’ pockets with public money.
Private bike companies provide the bikes and they price accordingly, without considering who needs to pay for the roads used, for the parking infrastructure, and for the inconvenience to pedestrians and cars from bikes plying and parking on public thoroughfares. And no compensation goes to anyone in Singapore when the green and carefully cultivated beauty of its public spaces is marred by badly parked multi-coloured bicycles.
Far be it for a business school professor to fetter capitalism, but capitalism unconstrained, operated without appropriate regulation, disproportionately imposes costs on many while creating wealth for very few.
Singapore’s regulators have long deserved their sterling reputation for their sagacity and ability to act quickly and decisively.
Before we reach the stage of Amsterdam here in Singapore, it is important to better regulate this growing industry. Appropriate and quick regulation will protect the growth of the bike-sharing industry, while stemming negative externalities and ensuring users and companies curb their free-riding.

The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) and Via, a technology developer and provider of on-demand shared rides, have partnered to offer on-demand shared rides to certain transit stations.
The project is funded in part by a $1.35 million grant from the Federal Administration (FTA) for advanced technology to help bridge the first/last mile gap.
Using the Via app, passengers can book a seat in a shared, dynamically-routed vehicle to or from three major Metro stations, according to the company. Via’s app will match passengers with others going their way in a vehicle. Via’s fares will also be subsidized by Metro.
Customers with disabilities — including those with service animals, wheelchairs, or other mobility aids or who need additional assistance to board — will be able to request rides that meet their needs, says the company.
Via will collaborate with Metro’s Office of Extraordinary Innovation to expand LA’s mobility menu, improving access to public transportation, and providing an affordable and accessible way to Go Metro.

“Via’s shared ride technology is perfect for connecting more people to public transit,” said Daniel Ramot, co-founder and CEO of Via.
“Metro is committed to offering innovative services to the public, and we are excited to help Metro solve the first and last mile challenge and help millions of new passengers take advantage of other public transportation options.”
“Metro is committed to expanding mobility options in Los Angeles County by leveraging Via’s innovations and expertise in offering dynamic shared rides,” said Joshua Schank, chief of Metro’s Office of Extraordinary Innovation. “Our project with Via demonstrates that there is potential to align public and private sector interests to improve mobility and provide a public benefit through ensuring that rides are affordable, equitable, and accessible for all of our customers.”
“We’re making our systems more inclusive — because access to public transportation is a right, not a privilege,” said Eric Garcetti, Metro chair and mayor of Los Angeles. “Everyone should be able to make a trip on Metro buses and trains, and these funds will help more riders get where they’re going quickly and conveniently.”
The Mobility On-Demand project is expected to begin in summer 2018.

Today electric cars make up just about 1% of the passenger vehicle market.
But 2017 has been a monumental turning point for the future of electric vehicles.
Batteries prices have dramatically dropped over the last five years, and consumers are already responding to these price drops. In 2015 sales grew up by 59% from the year before.

The Bloomberg forecast that plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles will make up 54 percent of new light-duty sales globally by 2040.

The country’s transition to a shared, electric and connected mobility system can save $330 billion (Rs 20 lakh crore) by 2030 on avoided oil imports alone, a report by Ficci-Rocky Mountain Institute said 21 November.

Representational image.

Even under a shared mobility paradigm, over 46,000,000 vehicles (two, three, and four wheelers) could be sold by 2030, it said.
“This annual market size would present an opportunity for Indian companies to become leaders in EV (electric vehicle) technology on a global scale,” it added.
The report said overcoming key barriers to vehicle electrification in the country’s passenger mobility sector presents an enormous challenge for India and also a tremendous economic opportunity.
“India can leapfrog the western mobility paradigm of private-vehicle ownership and create a shared, electric and connected mobility system, saving 876 million metric tons of oil equivalent, worth $330 billion and 1 giga-tonne of carbon-dioxide emissions by 2030,” it said.
It added that the main barriers to EV adoption include price, charging and consumer awareness.
EV charging infrastructure, battery swapping and manufacturing are some of the areas which can help overcome these barriers, the report said.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today termed cab sharing a “good idea” and invited suggestions on how to allow it, keeping in mind the safety of women.
His support for cab sharing which is at present being provided by app-based cab aggregators has come amid the Delhi government firming up the City Taxi Scheme 2017.
“I agree that ride sharing is a good idea. This is being discussed within the govt. Our concern is women safety.
Sharing a ride wid strangers may not be safe for women,” Kejriwal tweeted.
He also invited suggestions on how to allow ride sharing and simultaneously ensure women safety.
However, the opinion on whether to allow cab sharing or ban it is divided in the absence of any enabling law supporting either.
According to sources, Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot is against banning cab ride sharing and a final decision over it is expected to be taken today.
“The file related to the proposed City Taxi Scheme is pending with the minister’s office for his approval. Once the minister takes a decision, the draft will be sent to the Lt Governor and thereafter, it will be made public for general suggestion,” an official said on the condition of anonymity.

Cab aggregators operate with contract carriage permits that allow point-to-point transportation with no stop-overs between the origin and the final destination of a ride.
In contrast, the stage carriage permit, given for public service transport, allows pick and drop at different stops on a route.
The Motor Vehicles Act of 1988, does not allow shared rides by cabs that operate under contract carriage permits. It can be done only after amending the Act.

Electric Vehicles has taken centre-stage post the recent announcement of the Government to make India an all-electric passenger vehicle market by 2030.
Union Minister Nitin Gadkari recently made a bold statement to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, citing “Be under no illusion about the Indian government’s determination to make the switch to alternative vehicle fuels, “I am going to do this, whether you like it or not. And I am not going to ask you. I will bulldoze it”.

Electrical Vehicles: Mirage or Reality
The cornerstone of the government’s plans is a commitment to make India’s electric vehicle mission 2030 a success. This is a very ambitious undertaking. Of the circa 200 million vehicles which currently ply India’s roads, less than one percent is electric.
And this internal combustion engine-powered fleet is growing rapidly, currently at a rate of nearly 50,000 new motor vehicle registrations per day — which includes commercial vehicles, the ubiquitous three-wheelers or auto rickshaws, buses and taxis, as well as private scooters and cars.
“The level of growth means India’s plan to only sell electric cars by 2030, would require nearly eight times the global stock of such vehicles,” according to blogger Elizabeth Mathew, writing on Plug-in India; an excellent and enthusiastic proponent of India’s push for electric vehicles (EVs). By 2040 it is estimated that India could be home to 31 million EVs.
There is no plan for the government to develop nationwide charging infrastructure. Instead, the government hopes that by promoting the uptake of electric vehicles, it will create the ecosystem by which charging networks will become a necessity, and therefore present opportunities for commercial operators, including the power distribution companies (discoms).
Keeping India’s Electric vehicle fleet moving will require a significant growth in the country’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure. India has nearly 56,000 traditional fuel stations compared with 222 community EV charging stations. Developing India’ electric vehicle charging infrastructure is of utmost importance, to see a growth rate in electric vehicles.
Current Scenario in India’s EV Infrastructure
We are already seeing a divergence of business models for operators of charging infrastructure aimed at the users of private EVs.
Free EV charging points
To attract customers to some of its malls, property developer and real estate company DLF offers free EV charging at some locations. Similarly, EV manufacturer Mahindra Reva has an agreement with the Gopalan chain of malls to set-up free charging points at its retail centres.
Regulated rates for charging
In the summer of 2017, Tata Power launched Mumbai’s first commercial EV charging station, with customers paying rates set by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission. Reliance, another private power developer, is also reported to be looking at the EV charging market.

Reassess EV charging network
Discom Maharashtra Power Company is looking to use its substations in prime Mumbai and Pune locations as EV charging station sites. In a sign of the challenges, the commercial market presents high costs led discom Bangalore Electricity Supply Co to reassess plans to set-up a smart grid to provide an EV charging network in the city.
Community charging stations
An organic initiative intended to proliferate charging stations beyond city limits – thus contributing to the ecosystem that will allow EV use in India to flourish. Most businesses are connected to the grid and 15 Amp level 2 sockets are common in India. The idea is for businesses and organisations located between 40-70 km around cities to set-up 15 Amp charging stations.
The intention is to allow urban EV owners to extend the range of their journeys by offering out-of-town charging. There are currently 222 community charging stations, some offering free charging as an incentive to attract visitors – at resorts and malls for instance – others operate on a commercial basis with customers paying to charge their vehicles. The 15 Amp stations offer slower charging times than the 3 – DC systems set-up by discoms, or offered at most city-centre charging stations.
Investments by Large Fleet Operators 
Another area of growth in India’s EV infrastructure is investment in charging stations by operators of large fleets, many of which are already switching to EVs. Typically, such stations are at main hubs such as bus depots or taxi companies’ main offices or ranks. Taxi aggregator Ola, which operates an EV fleet in Nagpur has set-up 50 charging points across four strategic locations in the city.
Battery Swapping
The nascent concept of battery swapping is an area in which India’s EV infrastructure trends differ from those of more affluent nations. The battery is among the most expensive elements of any electric vehicle, with the cost increasing significantly as storage capacity grows. Affordability means that two and three-wheeled vehicles account for 80 percent of India’s domestic vehicle sales.
To ensure electrification of this vital fleet does not make two and three-wheeled vehicles prohibitively expensive, the government is seeking to encourage the sale of vehicles with smaller, and cheaper, batteries; while ensuring users have sufficient range by allowing them to swap low batteries for fully charged ones en-route. The network of battery swapping stations, like those for EV charging stations, is anticipated to develop a number of business models.
India’s approach to the Alternate Vehicle Fuels market
The government is using its own, highly significant procurement power, apart from providing vision, policy framework and financial stimulus to advance India’s use of electric vehicles.
The centre has signaled the intention to buy 10,000 EVs for its fleet. The first phase will be 1,000 EVs for use of government departments in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR).
In tandem with this Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) is planning tenders for nearly 4,000 EV charging stations in the NCR. Established under the Ministry of Power, EESL is a joint venture of NTPC Limited, Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation, and POWERGRID.
Whether operating on a commercial business model, charging a bus fleet, or ministerial cars, EV charging stations and networks demand a reliable power supply. Without this, they will fail. Although Central Electricity Authority data from 2016 showed India to have a power surplus for the first time, load shedding and power outages remain common, with some parts of India having access to power for less than eight hours a day.
As a result, it is anticipated that much EV charging infrastructure, especially that not operated by discoms, will require supplementary or alternative energy sources.
As the government is also keen to see an uptake in renewable energy sources it is widely expected that solar energy– especially roof-top solar will play a significant role in powering charging sites.
As EV evangelist Professor Ashok Jhunjhunwala told delegates at the 2017 Connected Vehicles conference, “Solar panels covering 0.5 percent of Rajasthan can generate power for 330 million EVs … We don’t have oil, sunlight we have.” The ability to generate, manage and store power – from both renewable and grid sources — make microgrids a likely element of much EV charging infrastructure.
Five steps to a successful Electric Vehicles Programme
Those involved in developing India’s EV charging infrastructure face some difficult, and sometimes opposing, considerations: business model – free or revenue generating? User – mass transit or private EV owner? Type – battery swap, community charger or high-speed super-charger? Power source – grid, solar or a microgrid managed hybrid.
Ensuring the right delivery partner is central to success, so here are five things to consider when planning your project:
• Business model: Choose a partner with experience of delivering EV charging programmes for all business models. They will be best placed to understand what is required to meet your specific goals.
• User: Virtually every aspect of mass transit charging infrastructure will differ from that for private EV owners. Be sure your partner has experience in creating both – so can draw upon best practice from a variety of sources.
• Type: Not only will the charging technology differ across types of stations. Planning, permitting, design and construction needs will also vary. You need a partner who can demonstrate experience in every aspect of the project.
• Power source: EV projects stand or fall on the reliability of the power supply. So you need to choose a partner with considerable expertise in both power generation and power supply projects – from both grid and renewable sources – and the proven ability to integrate them into an EV charging station.
• Finally, the best partner will be one with experience in every aspect of an EV charging programmes lifecycle: from concept through to asset management. This will be the partner best able to deliver maximum value from every aspect of your programme.

FARGO — A greenway running along the railroad tracks to the Red River and way out west of town. A car-share service. Tree-lined streets. A day center for homeless people seeking shelter.




These are some of the dozens of items on the wish list that’s found in the downtown master plan that city leaders approved Monday, Dec. 4. Most city commissioners present said they liked a lot of things in the plan though not everything.
Commissioner Tony Grindberg said he had been skeptical at first about the need for such a plan. “In some ways I’ve been proven wrong because this has been a very comprehensive effort that has really brought a lot of engagement from the community.”
The 158-page plan lays out a shared vision for downtown, putting in print many of the things people who care about the district have been talking about, such as more things to do, more parking, more routes for pedestrians and bicyclists, more affordable housing and more greenery.
To get there, the master plan includes a cornucopia of ideas. Here are a few of them:
Greenway loop: This stretched out park would follow the path of both of downtown’s railroad tracks from the river to the trail expected to be built along the path of the Fargo-Moorhead flood diversion for a 14-mile loop. The park would feature trees, shrubs, streams and ponds that form a barrier between people and trains. The greenway would provide a path for bicyclists and pedestrians, rainwater storage to reduce the threat of flooding, and greenery to liven up the urban landscape.
Car shares: Like the bike-share program already present downtown, a car share is a very short-term car rental. The plan calls for the city to invite companies such as car2go, Zipcar and Enterprise to provide such a service downtown. Studies show each car in a car share removes nine to 13 private cars from the road, according to the plan, which could reduce the pressure on downtown parking. Building more parking ramps or parking behind buildings are options as well, but the plan recognizes those things won’t be enough to meet demand. Demand reduction measures include encouraging employers to adopt carpool programs or using a bus to shuttle commuters to and from parking lots outside of downtown, something the city is already doing with the Link bus between downtown Fargo and the Moorhead Center Mall.

Homeless day center: Because of the services aimed at low-income people downtown, many homeless people hang out downtown. But because shelters are only open evenings and soup kitchens are only open at lunch time, the homeless often have nowhere to go in the morning. A day center would provide a place to get out of the cold, store belongings and even do laundry.
Townhouses and duplexes: Two kinds of homes dominate downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods: apartments and single-family homes. The plan says a variety of housing is needed if the area is to continue attracting more residents, especially with millennials aging and increasingly looking to buy homes. To get there and preserve single-family homes, the plan calls for townhouses and duplexes to be allowed in commercial areas at the edge of downtown. These areas include the University Drive corridor and areas between Island Park and Main Avenue.
Alley stores: The plan says more developers should be encouraged to provide alley-facing commercial spaces, something only the Kilbourne Group appears to be doing currently. Downtowners want more stores in the area, but that’s difficult because retail revenue is flat while rents are rising, according to the plan. Because commercial spaces are typically very deep, merchants usually have a hard time using all the space. Alley spaces would allow landlords to further subdivide commercial space and allow more merchants, especially start-ups, to afford being downtown.
Blue-green infrastructure: Downtown is mostly gray now, but the plan envisions more ponds and greenery. They serve to beautify the area, but they also reduce the risk of flooding caused by heavy rainstorms, something city staff has said occurs more frequently than river flooding and from which the city has limited protection. Besides retention ponds, the plan suggests putting water storage basins under the streets and building green roofs, basically rooftop gardens, that can absorb water. These basins can be used to water trees planted along the streets, which would provide shade and reduce the heat-island effect in which heat absorbing pavement makes urban areas hotter in the summer and increases the need for air conditioning.
Bump outs: Sidewalks could be livelier if there were space for more activities, according to the plan. That’s where “bump outs” come into play. These are extensions of existing sidewalks into space that might otherwise be used for parking, such as the ones at the corner of Broadway and Third Avenue North. Businesses can also build temporary bump outs such as the little deck that’s appeared in front of Vinyl Taco. The idea is to use the space for dining, socializing, bike parking and trees. A photo from Holland, Mich., in the plan shows a fireplace and seating on a bump out, suggesting a potential for year-round use.
Bike lanes: There are few dedicated bike lanes on downtown’s narrow streets now, but the plan suggests that there’s enough public interest to provide more. Several street plans show ways this can be done, though often that comes at a cost to on-street parking. Second Avenue North, for example, now features two lanes for cars, parallel parking on one side of the street and diagonal parking on the other. Diagonal parking allows more cars to park but takes more space. The plan, seeking to balance the needs of drivers with bicyclists and pedestrians, would convert that parking to narrow parallel parking to make space for bike lanes.

It’s no secret. When it comes to cars, Portland swipes left.




Our roads are one of the primary indicators of an unwavering population influx.
Streets are increasingly single-lane, and those flashy condos you see hovering over Division or the Pearl nix parking with pride. In turn, car ownership is a dying industry.




Now more than ever, denizens have to choose their wheels–and their minutes behind the wheel–wisely.
A city that bemoans traffic needs more options. Born in Seattle in April 2016 and launched in Portland last September, ReachNow offers a free-floating car share fleet that, unlike its competitors, is tailored specifically to both Portland’s psyche and geography.




ReachNow offers a range of BMWs and MINIs, all of which seat at least four. Most have all wheel drive, and this is the only car share in PDX with electric vehicles.

The automotive industry is in the early phases of what is expected to be rapid and fundamental change. The emergence of four trends, in particular, will lead to massive shifts in the business models of traditional automotive companies and open the door for other players who have, until recently, only been indirectly tied to the industry:

Autonomous driving. As of 2016, only one in 100 vehicles sold were equipped with technology that enabled basic, Level 2 autonomous-driving (AD) features. (Here, we use SAE International’s definitions as laid out in SAE J3016; Level 2 refers to partial automation.) However, 47 percent of consumers surveyed in a 2017 McKinsey survey on mobility say they would feel good if their family members used AD technology.
Connectivity. Internet-connected infotainment systems are the platforms for delivering a growing set of services to drivers. Most OEMs are already equipping their premium vehicles with fully connected systems, but monetization is weak. However, 40 percent of car owners would switch to another brand for better connectivity—a figure that’s twice as high as it was three years ago.
Electrification. Less than 5 percent of vehicles sold in 2016 had some type of electric motor. However, in a recent survey, 77 percent of respondents said the electrification of vehicles will make a material difference in reducing environmental impact, and 23 percent would consider an electric car for their next purchase.
Smart mobility. The range of alternative models for vehicle ownership and usage is diverse and includes car sharing and e-hailing. The fraction of passenger miles traveled using these services today is small, but our customer surveys showed that 67 percent of car owners plan to increase their use of car sharing in the next two years.

Technology is the key to further penetration of all these trends, as well as the developing business models that allow companies to capitalize on them. The industry players—traditional automotive companies and new entrants alike—that identify and secure those technological resources will be best positioned to benefit in the new mobility landscape. Thus, industry players need to think about sourcing underlying technologies rather than acquiring single products or services.
Hunting for technology
New competitors will challenge incumbents by quickly rolling out new business models, as well as by bringing new technologies to the market and capitalizing on them. The big question for all involved will be how to identify which technology capabilities are required for which areas of the new mobility value chain, and how to source them once they’ve been identified.
Sourcing options include, among others, developing new capabilities internally, hiring talent, or acquiring players with certain technological expertise. In many cases, competing successfully will also require cooperation – sometimes even in situations of simultaneous competition. New ecosystems will form along the value chain, as companies with complementary capabilities (for example, software development on one side and deep automotive-embedding capabilities on the other) partner in order to develop and deliver comprehensive offerings.


McKinsey’s Start-up and Investment Landscape Analysis tool reveals areas with the largest investment activity by using big data algorithms and semantic analytics. It leverages inputs from comprehensive private and venture-capital investment databases covering about two million companies. Furthermore, it analyzes developments over time and across geographies, and it identifies implicit technological similarities between organizations. The output can be displayed at the level of single investments or at an aggregated company view. It can also be tailored to include analysis of specific technologies, use cases, subsets of companies, or types of companies.
This information helps to identify trends in the emerging tech-driven mobility landscape and to locate technology capabilities. Of course, it takes into account only the external investment view; it does not cover internal investments, such as R&D expenses.


The first steps in building technological capabilities are gaining an understanding of which technologies are most appropriate and differentiating, given a company’s desired role in the new mobility ecosystem, and then finding out where those capabilities exist. Taking an investment view in that journey can be of tremendous value. Investments are usually a good predictor of the future significance of certain technological assets. We’ve developed an approach that analyzes the landscape to dive deeper (see sidebar, “Start-up and Investment Landscape Analysis: A big data tech-finding tool”).
Understanding where the money is going
Overall, our Start-up and Investment Landscape Analysis (SILA) tool reveals significant investment activities in new mobility technologies—nearly $111 billion in disclosed transactions since 2010 in more than 1,000 companies across ten technology clusters (Exhibit 1). Surprisingly, less than a third of these relate to shared-mobility companies; the rest focus on the trends of automation and connectivity. Out of the $111 billion, more than 60 percent come from large investments with disclosed transaction values greater than $1 billion, and the rest from small investments. However, one can learn much more from these smaller investments because they are related to smaller companies with special capabilities or technology. The large transactions, on the other hand, tend to be industry-shaping moves made on established companies. Understanding small players and start-ups is crucial to efficient technology sourcing.

Exhibit 1
 

To get more granular, we can also break down investments by trend. Of the ten clusters identified, the largest investments were in autonomous solutions and sharing solutions (Exhibit 2). It’s also worth noting that the pace of overall investment is accelerating greatly: between the periods of 2010–13 and 2014–17, the average annual investment across all technologies jumped nearly sixfold, from $4.3 billion per year to $25.3 billion per year. Investments in 2017 to date are as large as the total between 2010 and 2014. While investments in sharing and autonomous solutions account for much of this acceleration, investments in hardware like sensors and semiconductors are rather stable, showing a steady trend of consolidation.

Exhibit 2
 

Interestingly, the median annual investment amount per transaction grew by more than a factor of three from 2010 to today—rising from $4.5 million to $15.8 million. Technology is becoming more expensive, and it is getting more difficult to source it, as many are competing for the same players. OEMs with only a few technology-sourcing activities in the past years now face steep costs if they want to access technology via investments in start-ups and midsize companies.
It is also instructive to look at the links between clusters (shown by physical proximity on the node map). The strong interconnectedness of the ten clusters shows the strong links between underlying technologies, showing their wide-ranging applicability—for example, machine learning that is the underlying technology for autonomous-driving software, as well as voice recognition. This is a clear indicator to structure thinking around technology rather than actual services.
In addition to where investments are happening, our analysis also reveals how they are being made. An analysis of all disclosed investments shows that their structure differs significantly by cluster. Investment in autonomous driving is dominated by a few large deals focused on end-to-end solutions (for example, Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye), with a long tail of smaller investments. In the sensor and semiconductor cluster, consolidation characterizes the investment approach, while in user-interface or experience technologies, numerous smaller, specialized players are active.
Geographically, investments are quite concentrated. The majority of investment activity has targeted companies located in the United States (Exhibit 3). Of those, more than half are in the San Francisco Bay Area alone. China and Israel come next. Investments in European companies are small, with German companies accounting for the largest portion, coming in at just over $1 billion. Funding is relatively limited in Germany, though—60 companies there are active in mobility technologies, a number similar to China, which has investments that are over 20 times higher.

Exhibit 3
 

This means that non-American mobility players likely will require a footprint in the United States, not just to invest in technology but also to stay attuned to trends, as many are already doing.
Mapping changes in mobility players
As digital technology becomes a bigger force in automotive and mobility, the face of the “typical” industry player is also changing. SILA affirms this trend in showing that more than 90 percent of investments in the mobility space were made by players not traditionally seen as automotive companies—mainly technology companies, but also venture capitalists and private-equity players (Exhibit 4).

Exhibit 4
 

These new entrants are clearly committed to staking their claim in the mobility market, and they are leveraging their digital expertise to make it happen. Of the total investments of $111 billion since 2010, $31 billion was invested in 2016 alone. And of this $31 billion, automotive players invested less than $2 billion (about 6 percent). However, the R&D budgets of auto players in 2016 were $77 billion—more than twice as high as the total investments identified, and nearly 40 times higher than investments by auto OEMs. These players need to take action if they want to stay in the race for technology.
Setting a winning pace in the tech race
Our analysis shows that the race for technology is intense and gaining speed, with major external players entering the space. As it gets more crowded and more diverse, the cost of that technology rises—only investments in hardware are not accelerating. This does not necessarily mean that incumbents need to attempt to outspend new entrants. They will, however, need to position themselves relative to tech companies and define their own technology strategy, including securing access to the technologies they’ve identified as potential differentiators.
To do this successfully, companies must move beyond an anecdotal approach and toward a structured method of technology sourcing. In this respect, traditional automotive players may employ strategies such as purchasing or investing in companies, forming partnerships or alliances, or developing new kinds of tier-one relationships (such as close collaboration partnership houses). The sourcing approach should depend on the dynamics of each technology cluster, as well as the individual company’s strategy. Many small players, for instance, develop innovations in the field of user-interface technologies, making an M&A-like approach possible. On the other hand, large technology players dominate the voice-recognition technology space (for example, BMW plans to integrate Amazon’s Alexa technology), making partnership approaches viable.
The first step, however, will be for automotive companies to identify the use cases and technologies that matter to them and that will be differentiating in the long term. By identifying the relevant technological control points along the value chain—say, driving software, connected services, or human–machine interfaces—they can pinpoint required capabilities. With clarity around these decisions, automotive companies can then determine potential sources of such technologies. This path is applicable to suppliers and OEMs alike, as both will need to invest significant resources in all four disruptive automotive trends.

Developments in autonomous driving, connectivity, electrification, and smart mobility are fundamentally changing the mobility sector. Mastering the underlying technologies will it make it possible for companies to extract the value of these trends. By identifying relevant technologies and investment trends in the new mobility landscape, and by cultivating an understanding of the use cases they’d like to develop and the control points they’d like to own, automotive players can then strategize about acquiring the required technology capabilities.

The Sacramento area is on its way to becoming the first city in the nation with an expansive network of shared electric vehicles and charging stations.
Part of Volkswagen’s settlement with the State of California over its diesel emissions cheating scheme, is to promote and advance the use of zero emission vehicles throughout the state.
The automaker will start that project in Sacramento, by investing $44 million in charging stations and an electric vehicle sharing program.
Phil Serna is a Sacramento County Supervisor and also sits on the California Air Resources Board.
He says Sacramento is turning lemons into an incredible lemonade.

“We’re taking the deception of Volkswagen and turning that into an investment plan that will actually, not only benefit the technology of zero emission vehicles but it’s actually going to expand mobility for those that most need it in undeserved communities,” says Serna.
Mark McNabb is the CEO of Electrify America – the arm of Volkswagen that’s running the Green City program.
He’s worked in the auto industry for decades and says this is a transformational moment.
“I think that, you know, when you look at cities like this and you look at other cities in the future, at how are they going to handle mobility, and I think we’re going to experiment with a lot of different mobility – car sharing I think is very interesting, millenials don’t own cars like we do, some of the older folks,” says McNabb.
McNabb says he expects to have the first charging stations in place within six to eight months. He says some of the ones placed along I-5, 80, and Highway 99 will be super chargers, giving drivers up to 20 miles of charge in just one minute.

Although shared mobility is a nascent force on the automotive scene, it generates a lot of buzz. This hype can make it hard to understand what’s actually happening in the sector. To bring greater clarity to the situation, McKinsey surveyed 2,000 shared-mobility consumers across ten US cities: Austin, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, Milwaukee, New York City, Peoria, Richmond, and San Francisco. The effort looked at cities of varying sizes, population levels, and demographic compositions to ensure an adequate representation of North American consumers.
The survey revealed changing attitudes and behavior among mobility customers. It also examined ride-hailing and ride-sharing trends, the effect of recent disruptions on perceptions of shared vehicles, and the importance of car ownership to consumers. In addition, respondents offered a glimpse of their thoughts on the future of mobility in the United States.
The US mobility landscape is beginning to shift
Consumers appear to use taxis and buses significantly less than they did in the recent past, with price and service reliability driving much of this decline. Taxi rides decreased by nearly 10 percent from 2014 to 2016, bus rides by 5 percent in the same period (Exhibit 1).

Exhibit 1
 

 
Several factors affect the mobility experience—and customers list high prices and low comfort levels as key elements of a bad one. Users cited the cost of taxis as a big drawback, and their main complaint about mass-transit options such as buses and trains centered on a lack of comfort. Users also spoke to what makes for a good experience. For taxis, convenience was the key to satisfaction, while for buses it was price. Attitudes toward subway and train rides reflect on-time reliability and safety, respectively.
Ride hailing and ride sharing have grown in importance
Last year, around 15 to 20 percent of North America’s population used ride-hailing services, predominantly concentrated in urban areas. The primary reasons users choose them are ease of use, lower prices than conventional taxis charge, and convenience (Exhibit 2). Consumers base their selection of a ride-hailing service primarily on four factors: the driver’s behavior, price, the condition and cleanliness of the car, and wait times.

Exhibit 2
 

 
When the survey asked consumers what they didn’t like about ride hailing, the most common response—from 33 percent of them—was that it was too expensive during “surge pricing” periods, such as rush hour. This suggests that customers value price over other considerations and will base their transportation choices on this sensitivity. More than a quarter complained about the lack of mobile Internet access or the quality of access, if it was available. As network coverage grows, however, this issue will likely become less of a problem. Consumers said the best way to improve ride-hailing services would be offering more competitive prices. Other suggestions focused on coaching drivers to improve their attitudes and behavior and on reducing wait times.
 
Current ride-hailing customers said their usage will soon rise significantly; nearly a third said it would “increase a lot” over the next two years. Conversely, a sizable proportion of nonusers (38 percent) indicated that they were not interested in ride hailing in the future, and an additional 20 percent expressed only slight interest in it. These findings suggest a need for targeted awareness-building campaigns that take the mystery out of ride hailing while emphasizing its benefits in both convenience and cost.
One key finding: the status conferred by private-car ownership continues to decline. Increasingly, consumers view cars simply as tools for moving from one place to another. For example, given the choice of a free car or free ride-hailing service, higher-income segments preferred free rides over free cars; none of those making $150,000 or more chose the car (Exhibit 3).

Exhibit 3
 

 
Less affluent consumers indicated a higher preference for free cars: among those making $75,000 or less, roughly 70 percent selected them. The bias of affluent consumers toward ride hailing likely signals a greater preference for convenience. However, when consumers were given a survey option to trade in cars for free ride-hailing service, over half expressed no interest.
Ride sharing is similar to ride hailing but more akin to carpooling. A third of users said they expected to increase their use of ride sharing “a lot” over the next two years. Yet more than 60 percent of survey takers expressed either no or very little interest in using ride-sharing services in that time frame. This represents another area where awareness-building initiatives make sense.
Most respondents said they did not use carpooling, because of time constraints (“I am always in a hurry and don’t want to wait”), privacy needs, and safety concerns. Among consumers who carpooled, most—71 percent—did so to save money.
Future mobility choices will be more diverse
There’s a consensus that the use of private cars will decline in the long term, partly as a result of an increase in autonomous “robo-taxis” and the use of public transportation. When the survey asked consumers to compare their current mobility usage with their probable choices 15 years in the future, they saw themselves using private cars 12 percent less. They also expected to choose ride-hailing and ride-sharing services 7 percent more, and to travel by public transportation 4 percent more.

As consumers increasingly embrace shared mobility, the automotive industry and other sectors need to recalibrate their business models and strategic thinking to account for this shifting landscape. McKinsey’s survey reveals an awakening among consumers about the potential expansion of their mobility options. Industry players need to position themselves to capitalize on these emerging mobility disruptions to remain ahead of this rapidly evolving game.

It is exciting to hear that Singapore’s first large-scale electric car-renting service will start in December (“Electric car-sharing services to hit roads in December”; Sept 27).
Successfully implemented, this initiative could bring us one-step closer to our vision of a “car-lite” nation, as outlined in the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint.
However, I foresee two challenges that the operator, BlueSG, needs to overcome to encourage widespread adoption of its service.
The first difficulty would be the competition against ride-sharing platforms such as Grab. Just a few months back, Grab announced that it had raised US$2 billion (S$2.72 billion) from Japan’s SoftBank Group and China’s top ride-hailing firm, Didi Chuxing, and these will go towards improving infrastructure, as well as its payment platform.
At the consumer level, we can expect ride-sharing services to be cheaper and more convenient.
In order to compete and appeal to the market, the service offered by BlueSG must be affordable. To reduce the cost for individual consumers, the company can take the cue from ride-hailing companies to offer a carpooling option.
This strategy fits in well with the one-way mechanism business model, where pick-up location and return location can be different.
The second challenge is related to the charging stations for electric vehicles across the island.
Unlike traditional vehicles which can refuel in minutes, the time taken to charge an electric car ranges from 30 minutes to eight hours, depending on the type of batteries, vehicle models, and charging infrastructure. Imagine renting an electric car, only to discover to your frustration that it is running low on battery.
The plan is for 1,000 BlueSG cars to hit Singapore’s roads by 2020, in addition to 500 charging stations and 2,000 charging points — 400 of them for non-BlueSG users.
In deploying these stations, it will be important to assess the locations of these charging stations, along with the average time the electric cars may travel before the batteries deplete, the queuing and charging times, and the space alloted for other electric private vehicles tapping the same power at each vicinity.

A shared vehicle system could reduce the number of cars in cities to a little as 4 percent of current numbers, new research shows.
Such systems – where cars, possibly autonomous, would cruise around a city and people would call one up using an app on their phone – would dramatically reduce traffic congestion and pollution.
Passengers would sit in the back, sharing the car with others, and do their emails while the vehicle takes them to their destination.
The International Transport Forum research focused on Finnish capital, Helsinki, and arrived at its four percent figure based on its most optimistic scenario involving shared vehicles, like large taxis or minivans, combined with existing public transport on fixed routes.
The forum’s previous research, in 2015, estimated a fleet reduction to 10 percent, based on transport modes in the Portuguese capital, Lisbon.
Both findings are seen as credible by experts in New Zealand, where cars often sit in a garage at home all night and at a carpark at workplaces during the day.
Estimates of actual car usage vary between 5 percent and 15 percent of an average 24-hour period with vehicles sitting idle for the rest of the time, making purchasing a car very expensive in real terms.
It also gives cars a high environmental impact, when their lifetime environmental footprint is taken into account.

Under a shared-vehicle scenario, the real costs of purchasing vehicles would be shared between all who use them.
Car experts think the benefits identified by the forum would vary and be far less significant in rural areas than in big cities but the impact could also be improved with varied working hours so rush hour would be less hectic.
The benefit would be real either way, according to the forum.
“Replacing private car traffic with new shared mobility services in urban areas dramatically reduces the number of cars needed, significantly cuts CO2 emissions and frees large swathes of public land for uses other than parking,” the forum report said.
“And it would not make it more difficult for users to get from door to door.”

While private-hire vehicles in other countries are usually cars owned by the drivers, the ones in Singapore tend to be rented, thus creating a “rental car for hire” market (Drivers seek ‘fairer approach’ in taxation; Sept 20).
We should move away from this “rental car for hire” market to a “private car for hire” market and leverage the car-sharing platform.
Cars bought by rental companies for private-hire use should have a shorter certificate of entitlement validity of eight years. This is to reflect the higher usage of such vehicles and will be in line with the restrictions on taxis.

Ride-hailing app operators should not be operating a car rental business.
Otherwise, they would have a cross-subsidising competitive advantage which is not available to other car rental companies.
If the operators do have a car rental 
business on a sizeable scale, there should be some regulation control, like those for taxi businesses.



There are more than 40,000 private car owners using one of the mobile platforms for social carpooling.



There is, therefore, an acceptance among car owners to have strangers on board their vehicles.
If Singapore endeavours to be a smart nation that embraces technological change, there should be a national movement to have all private cars here on board the car-sharing push.
In doing so, there will be economies of scale and a full exploitation of the technology.
The use of every car will be better optimised and the entire car-sharing platform will be more efficient.
Such optimisation will be useful when the occasional public transport problem surfaces.
The Government, as the largest employer, can lead this charge by allowing civil servants to register as private-hire car drivers.
Perhaps, some restrictions can be imposed, such as allowing only up to two trips on working days, except on Fridays and the eve of public holidays.
Other employers can then take the lead from the civil service.

The age of the shared economy is well and truly under way, what with travellers preferring to stay in Airbnb homes rather than hotels, bicycle-sharing becoming a popular mobility alternative; and private-hire services such as Grab or Uber favoured by many.
If the latest trends are anything to go by, alternatives to car ownership could very well be next. Locally, car ownership has reportedly dropped about 9 per cent since 2013, while the rental car population has more than doubled since then.

While some might point to the increasingly prohibitive cost of car ownership in Singapore as the reason for this, the move towards a shared proposition is also gaining traction.
It seems that the new generation of drivers is averse to big financial commitments, especially when most cars are considered depreciating assets and the rate of succession of new models has escalated to the point where there is always a newer, better model just a few months away. Which is where car sharing comes into the picture.
One car manufacturer that has gotten into car sharing in a big way is Audi, with its own programme dubbed Audi on demand+.
Through an app, the user is able to select from a range of Audi models and reserve the chosen car. Next, the user selects the date and time as well as the nearest collection point to pick up the car. Of course, there are other terms and conditions, but that is basically it.
Although this service is currently only available in Munich, San Francisco, Hong Kong and Beijing, local importer Audi Singapore is reviewing the feasibility of bringing the service here. So too is Audi’s parent company, Volkswagen (VW).
“A direct rental service is something we’re looking into as part of our future plans,” said Ricky Tay, managing director, Volkswagen Group Singapore.
The carmaker currently runs a rental service specially catered for weddings — couples can opt for the iconic Beetle or open-top Beetle Cabriolet, which come in the “Pure White” shade.
In the meantime, VW started a car-sharing initiative with Car Club in January. Car Club, an established operator which has been in the car-sharing business here for 20 years, features 52 Volkswagen cars such as the Polo, Golf, Jetta, Touran and Beetle, all of which are the latest models.
Car Club itself has 250 cars in its fleet, which can be accessed by signing up as a member for a fee. Rentals are charged by the hour or day, and drivers can even take the cars into Malaysia for an extra charge.
Bookings are made through the mobile app or website, and cars can be reserved from up 60 days in advance to even 15 minutes before collection, depending on availability.
Currently, there is only one Car Club station — in the multi-storey carpark next to Bishan’s Junction 8 shopping mall — exclusively dedicated to VW models, although Tay said they are “in discussions with Car Club to create a second dedicated satellite station for Volkswagen, and include more Volkswagen models in their fleet in the near future”.
“With the uncertain economic outlook, we understand that purchasing a vehicle may not be feasible for some people in the near future,” said Tay. “Yet at the same time, these people still require personal mobility solutions, especially those who travel together with their parents and young children.
“By partnering with Car Club, we are able to serve this group of people by providing high-quality, technologically advanced cars for their use as short-term car ownership,” he added.
Car-sharing rentals by the hour hover around S$11, and a day’s rental can set you back by at least S$110 per day, depending on the model you want. And that is not including your membership fees and other charges such as fuel.
However, some people, such as Daniel Tan, say it is still a viable option when the occasion arises. “My family and I usually take public transport,” he said. “But there was one time when we went shopping for furniture and instead of getting the delivery, we decided to rent a car instead.
“It made a difference because we didn’t have to wait for the delivery, we could bring the furniture back there and then. And the difference in the delivery fee was not that great.” Although some may say car-sharing will cannibalise car sales, Volkwagen’s Tay begged to differ.
“We do not feel that this is the case. Car-sharing is, after all, a stop-gap measure as a personal mobility solution — and there is no guarantee of renting an exact model, especially during peak periods such as festive seasons,” he said.
“For those who require the usage of a car on a regular basis, it is a lot more convenient to own one.”
Regardless, as the cost of car ownership increases, car-sharing options such as Car Club could offer the benefit of accessible personal mobility to those who only need a car occasionally, or to those are looking to try before they buy. ADDITIONAL TEXT BY CHRISTOPHER TOH

The first car sharing network using Russian cars will be launched in Moscow in December, the car sharing operator Carousel said in a press release on Thursday.
Car sharing is a model of car rental where people rent cars for short periods of time, often by the hour.




“By using the Carousel mobile application one can rent a brand-new Lada Granta car with an automatic gearbox for only 5 rubles ($0,08) per minute.




The first users will receive an hour of rent as a gift and will be able to ride on merry-go-round for free,” the company’s advertisement says. (In Russian the name of the car sharing service Carousel means “merry-go-round” – TASS).
These cars are equipped with automatic transmission, air bags, air conditioning, seat heaters, audio system, according to the statement.

“Now most car sharing networks use cheap Korean or Chinese cars.
We buy domestic Lada Granta in the Comfort package with an automatic box, air conditioning, electric power steering”, Ivan Serebrennikov, founder of the Carousel service said as quoted by the press service.
Currently, Moscow has five car sharing operators: YouDrive, Delimobile, Anytime, Car5 and BelkaCar. Their total fleet is 2,650 cars.
According to the city authorities, each of these cars makes eight trips daily on average. More than 600,000 people are registered in the system.
The estimated capacity of the Moscow market of car sharing is 10,000-15,000 cars.

Octo Telematics (Octo) subsidiary Omoove, Europe’s leading shared mobility technology provider, has today revealed its new product, Sharemine, the shared mobility platform that lets operators build a carsharing or ridesharing community, usable by individuals and fleet owners.  
Sharemine is a web-based tool, which provides individuals and companies with the ability to create and monitor carsharing and ridesharing communities. It works for parents trip-sharing for the school run and sporting events to friends co-ordinating travel plans to less accessible locations. Sharemine is also of great benefit to owners and operators of vehicle fleets, particularly small and medium enterprises.
The community is fully configurable and the dashboard allows tracking of the number of users and vehicles currently active, as well as drivers, riders, bookings and travel in progress. It also allows rental or ride revenue to be tracked according to rates defined by the community manager. Based on community manager preference, Sharemine allows the inclusion of insurance telematics capabilities based on Octo technology to encourage safer driving and ensure that drivers are benefitting from their good driving behaviours. 
Consumers are faced with rising insurance prices, growing urbanisation and congestion on the roads, as well as increased awareness of environmental issues. This means that they are turning away from private car ownership to solutions that can keep them on the roads, as well as solvent. This is resulting in rapid growth in the carsharing segment. Globally, revenue generated by carsharing and ridesharing is expected to grow at CAGRs of 19.5% and 24.5%[1] respectively. By 2025, revenue is expected to reach USD 9.2 billion from USD 1.5 billion in 2015[2]. In Europe alone, more than 3.9 million people choose to share vehicles or carpool, sharing a fleet of 59,452 vehicles in 26 countries[3]. 
Small- and medium-enterprises, in particular, may not be able to afford bespoke or proprietary technology to receive ongoing updates on their fleets. Sharemine represents an affordable alternative. Using the community platform and telematics systems incorporated into Sharemine allows operators to track their vehicles, as well as monitor usage and wear and tear in order to ensure that maximum return on investment is gained from each asset. 
Edwin Colella, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer of Omoove said: “The roads are becoming increasingly full of private vehicles which are not necessarily justifying their value. For each car which is shared, we can see 10 to 15 traditionally-owned vehicles removed from the roads, potentially taking 5.3 million cars from the global fleet. The benefits of this to consumers are obvious, allowing them to achieve reduced costs and see improved convenience on the roads. Through Sharemine, we’re pleased to be playing a key role in this rapidly developing industry, which is taking on the form of a social movement.” 
Shared mobility also has significant environmental impact as cities will see reduced emissions, traffic congestion and a lesser need for traffic infrastructure such as parking areas and even road maintenance. Frost & Sullivan estimate that, by 2025, more than 85 billion fewer kilometres will be driven as a result of car and ridesharing, resulting in a reduction of 10.5 million tons of Co2. 
Jonathan Hewett, Chief Marketing Officer, Octo Telematics said: “Octo is committed to safer driving, as well as improving each road user’s driving experience. With the cost of insurance, especially in the UK, set to continue rising, it’s important that motorists be provided with options to keep driving. By supporting carsharing initiatives and technology such as this, as well as providing drivers with telematics solutions to combat insurance increases, we are able to support cleaner, safer roads and make sure that motorists are still able to get to their destinations at a reasonable cost.”
The first Community Managers are already being brought onto the platform. Sharemine will be opened to the public in August.

India will leapfrog like it did with the telecom sector, banking and the railways with Shinkansen coming in a few years from now, he said.

The vision behind the experiments Ford Smart Mobility is undertaking?
When you think about the city of tomorrow, the kind of expectations consumers have about what companies need to try out in that world is not limited to just being a vehicle manufacturer. They expect you to be a service innovator so that they have more reasons to buy a vehicle. I think all the work we have been doing through these experiments is learning about that aspiration. How people want to travel, how they want a relationship to evolve over time, what are they prepared to give up in terms of data so that you can be more responsive, how you respond to that cohesively at a city level… It’s a big challenge because with urbanisation, people are coming to cities at an unprecedented pace … if we don’t say we have the same aspiration of providing cities which are thriving ­ that attract growth, jobs, eliminate accidents, make journeys more predictable, dynamic ­ then we are going to create roadblocks to our success.

Ridesharing has the potential to bring a wealth of benefits both to the actors directly involved in the shared trip (e.g., shared travel costs or access to high-occupancy vehicle facilities) and also to the society in general (e.g., reduced traffic congestion and CO2 emissions). However, even though ridesharing is based on a win-win collaboration and modern mobile communication technologies have significantly eased discovering and managing ride matches, the adoption of ridesharing has paradoxically decreased during the last years. In this respect, recent studies have highlighted how privacy concerns and the lack of trust among peers are crucial issues that hamper the success of ridesharing. In this chapter, the authors, Sánchez, Martinez and Domingo-Ferrer, from the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, tackle both of these issues by means of (i) a fully decentralized P2P ridesharing management network that avoids centralized ride-matching agencies (and hence private data compilation by such agencies); and (ii) an also decentralized reputation management protocol that brings trust among peers, even when they have not previously interacted. 
Their proposal rests on co-utility, which ensures that rational (even purely selfish) peers will find no incentives to deviate from the prescribed protocols. They have tested their system by using data gathered from real mobility traces of cabs in the San Francisco Bay area, and according to several metrics that quantify the degree of adoption of ridesharing and the ensuing individual and societal benefits.

The newly emerged traffic mode, car sharing, is helpful to reduce energy consumption and traffic pressure. Low-income people, who have fewer options for transportation and little choice in terms of employment location, need to be paid more attention. In order to evaluate travel efficiency of car sharing system, this paper studied the commuting travel characters of low-income people, including their trip time, trip mode choice, trip length, trip frequency, and route choice each day. Then we put forward the evaluation indexes and studied the efficiency evaluation model of car sharing system and other traffic choices. Considering the characters of various traffic modes, we developed an efficiency index which including the total travel time, distance, and cost. Efficiency evaluation model of car sharing was built using the investigation data of travel mode selection. The results show that car sharing is an efficient traffic mode during peak hours in Beijing. The results are meaningful to guide the operation and management of urban public transport.

EasyOpen: OT (Oberthur Technologies), a leading global provider of embedded security software products and services, and Omoove, a company by Octo Telematics, a European leader in providing innovative technological solutions dedicated to Shared Mobility, they are joining forces to transform user experience and increase security for car sharing services. The two companies developed EasyOpen, a service powered by OT’s Secure IOT Cloud that transforms smartphones into car keys, at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
EasyOpen combines OT’s expertise in secure service enablement for smartphones and wearable devices with Omoove’s multiple years of experience in car sharing platforms and on-board technology.
Until now, the majority of car sharing fleet systems relied on direct communication between components installed in vehicles and a central management system. These purely online systems tended to create latencies for the users, and potentially made the vehicles vulnerable to illicit use. To offer a superior level of reliability and solve latency issues, EasyOpen introduces the use of a smartphone with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to quickly and safely manage access to vehicles enabling users to directly interact with the vehicle using a device they already own, even if their smartphone is out of range of network coverage or runs out of battery. The service can also be extended to any wearable device equipped with an eSE (embedded Secure Element) supporting NFC technology.

Relying on OT’s Secure IOT Cloud, EasyOpen ensures strong authentication of the user’s smartphone and secure provisioning and storage of the digital keys in its eSE from the enrolment to the effective use of the service. In practice, it will provide an extremely simple, intuitive and fast user experience. After initially registering to the service through the EasyOpen application provided by Omoove, users will be able to immediately find vehicles in the area using their smartphone and book the one of their choice. Digital keys will be sent remotely and in a secure way via OT’s Secure IOT Cloud to the user’s device. The user will simply have to place the smartphone close to the windshield to unlock the door. OT’s eSE equipping the NFC receiver installed in the cars will then ensure the secure communication between the user’s device and the car and will also enable the remote management of the access rights at the car level. In case of device loss or theft, the digital key will be disabled remotely to avoid misuse.

The Republic’s first large-scale electric car-sharing service will begin in December with a smaller roll-out than initially planned, with operator BlueSG acknowledging that it was “behind schedule”.
About 80 electric cars and 30 charging stations — offering 120 charging points — will be rolled out progressively from December, BlueSG announced on Wednesday (Sept 27). This is fewer than the 125 vehicles and 250 charging points previously planned to launch by the middle of this year.

Managing director Franck Vitte said streamlining the process for authorisation to build the charging stations — new to the market here — took slightly longer than expected. Various parties, such as the parking agencies and energy company SP Group, also had to be brought together. But he was quick to add: “Things have been streamlined, ironed out with the various parties, and we see a significant acceleration in terms of process.”
The company said groundbreaking work to install the first 30 charging stations will start by the end of this month. Eighteen stations will be rolled out in public housing estates including Tampines, Bishan and Punggol. Ten stations will be situated in the city-centre and its fringes, and the remaining two at one-north and the Science Park.
Drivers will first pair an ez-link card — their mode of identification to book and collect a car — with the service via a charging kiosk. Users without an ez-link card can request a BlueSG card.
BlueSG commercial and network director Jenny Lim said the company was working to possibly integrate other cards with its system after December.
At the charging kiosk, users are required to enter a four-digit personal identification number and confirm they have a valid driver’s licence, among other things. Tapping their ez-link cards near the side-mirror will unlock the car. Users may book their cars in advance via avenues such as BlueSG’s mobile app or call centre, and reserve a parking space at their destination, which will be held for 1.5 hours.
“Even if you (are stuck in a) traffic jam, (there’s) more than enough time … to arrive at your destination,” said Mdm Lim.
The four-seat cars can run for about 200km with air-conditioning after a full charge. The company declined to disclose its rates, saying these will be unveiled several weeks before the December launch.
TODAY previously reported that the service will run on a subscription basis and members could be charged less than S$10 for a 15-minute journey. Pressed yesterday, Mr Vitte said the rates would be “around there”.
Mdm Lim said users can take up either an annual premium plan — which comes with lower per-minute rates — or an ad-hoc one.
A subsidiary of the Bollore Group, which operates the world’s largest fully electric car-sharing programme, BlueSG signed an agreement with the authorities in June last year to operate the service here for a decade.
Under the programme, 1,000 electric cars will be rolled out in Singapore by 2020, on top of 500 charging stations with 2,000 charging points — 400 of them for non-BlueSG users. When rolled out fully, it is set to be the world’s second-biggest electric car-sharing service. Paris-based Autolib’ service, which was launched in 2011, is the world’s largest. Also run by the Bollore Group, it boasts 4,000 electric vehicles and 6,200 charging points.
On Wednesday, BlueSG also officially unveiled its Asia-Pacific headquarters at the Science Park. The focal point of its e-mobility, energy management and system integration business in the region, the hub will house more than 30 employees by the end of this year. The company, which will also set up a global innovation centre here for research and development in mobility and energy management solutions, aims to create about 250 jobs in Singapore by 2021.

In its efforts toward developing self-driving vehicles, ride-sharing company Uber has constructed a purpose-built ‘fake city’ for the testing of its autonomous cars, which already run in San Francisco.
Dubbed Almono, the facility is built on a 11,000 sq ft plot of land comprising a veritable smorgasbord of obstacles including roadways, complicated intersections, fake cars and unpredictable pedestrians.
Uber has plans to further expand the facility by another 13,000 sq ft, which will go towards the company’s efforts in testing their self-driving vehicles’ abilities before they reach service on public roads.
The obstacles put in place are meant to test Uber’s self-driving vehicles far beyond what they may encounter in real-life deployment, Uber said.
“We have obstacles and mannequins that move and can cross the street in front of the car. We have prop vehicles zooming around.
In most situations, we simulate those in such a way that they’re worse than anything you would see out on public roads,” said Uber vehicle operator Rick McKahan.

Behind the computer-intensive operations of autonomous driving, Uber’s human operators are tested here too.
Following written tests, the company’s vehicle operators are also assessed on the Almono testing grounds before they are cleared to monitor the self-driving cars out in the real world.
The ride-sharing company hasn’t revealed its latest list of autonomous vehicles, though it has partnered with Volvo and Ford in earlier autonomous technology developments, while each automaker embarked on their own autonomous tech work.

Is India well positioned to benefit from technological changes globally in electric vehicles, shared mobility, connected devices and autonomous vehicles? Not really, feels Asutosh Padhi, Senior Partner, McKinsey & Company Inc, USA.
India is the world’s sixth largest automobile hub and is expected to take third place by 2030.
But by 2030, the automobile industry as we know it today will have undergone a radical shift. By then, 25-40 per cent of the vehicles will probably be running on electricity. Whereas “China has worked religiously in this area for over 20 years and is a world leader. In India, the regulations are still evolving and infrastructure is physically not in place.”
Even for customers globally it is a lot more positive than in India in terms of products, specifications and choices they have, he says.
Whether electric vehicles, ride sharing or connectivity they are all inter-linked. The propensity of fleet operators to go electric is increasing.
Not just the OEMs but the component suppliers and all stakeholders need to look at their play and core business as the relevance of internal combustion engine decreases.
Customers always benefit from technological disruption but it is a challenge for industries to change. For instance, those making power transmission and the after-market will be impacted unless they prepare to change with the times.
Shivanshu Gupta, Partner, McKinsey & Company, believes, “India is missing in action and is not present in this value chain.”
Look at what happened in semiconductors and cell phones. India may use tonnes of cell phones but those are not made here, he pointed out.
The Indian automobile industry is well aware of developments in these key areas, but even they are not aware of the “pace at which this change is happening”.
The total cost of ownership of a battery powered vehicle was $1000 per kwh in 2010 which has now come down to about $ 200 per kwh and is expected to further go down to $100 per kwh between 2020-2025.
Padhi and Gupta spoke to BusinessLine recently after the launch of the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility (MCFM).
The centre brings together expertise in automotive sector, cities, freight, infrastructure, utilities, and their various points of intersection.
The objective is to provide an “independent and unbiased, fact-based perspective” on the rapid changes to support the industry, Padhi said.

We often hear people ask, “Who will be the winner in the transformation the mobility sector is facing?” As autonomous driving, shared mobility, connectivity, and electrification disrupt the industry, there is uncertainty about who will come out on top: traditional players or new entrants, the hardware or the software guys, Western or Asian companies, product or service companies? In our perspective, however, success in the emerging personal-mobility landscape will depend less on what individual players are doing today and more on the choices they make regarding tomorrow’s strategic direction.
In our first article on the acceleration of the automotive revolution, we offered an integrated perspective on two key questions: What is the speed of change, and what do the new value pools look like? In this one, we present our perspective on the logical third question: What is required to successfully navigate the emerging personal-mobility landscape in an uncertain future?
The previous piece introduced the concept of a new personal-mobility landscape in which players move beyond rigid roles and, instead, may employ more than one business model, engage multiple technologies, and be active across mobility layers as their capacity to deliver value to their customers allows (Exhibit 1).

Exhibit 1
 

In this article, we take a deeper look at this landscape to identify themes related to how industry players might actually accomplish this.
Successfully growing or transitioning into the new mobility industry will require more than simply defining or reorienting a fixed strategy. Strong navigators will learn how to choose based on probabilities. At the same time, they will remain agile and not fixate on a single road forward. As such, mobility players should take four actions, which we will discuss in more detail: define their strategic posture and select differentiating capabilities to build, choose their individual strategic setup, pursue optimal partnerships, and actively manage the transition from traditional to disruptive models.
1. Prioritizing capabilities to realize a healthy strategic posture
The future of the mobility industry is characterized by uncertainty. As such, there will likely be several ways forward due to the impact of regulations, technological disruptions, and divergence of consumer needs, for example—each unfolding at a different pace. Players thus need to think about which developments they consider more probable than others and how well they are positioned to follow those paths toward successful outcomes.
In doing so, identifying relevant technology and business-model competencies that will allow for differentiation is an important step and should be taken early on in order to define a suitable strategic posture. On the technology side, mastering software capabilities or creating advanced skills in electrification may become key areas for successful differentiation. Similarly, in considering where to focus concerning business-model competencies, it could be critical to choose competencies using a customer-centric perspective.
Moreover, trends in the space will also require players to develop a robust organization that enables capabilities around digitization, automation, and innovation, for instance, to the point that they are able to compete along their newly chosen core competencies.
Taking a closer look, we find 25 competencies in the areas of technology and business models, which can be clustered into front-end and back-end competencies, as well as five organizational enablers (Exhibit 2). Companies must master them all to successfully differentiate and serve consumers across all four disruptive trends (autonomous driving, shared mobility, connectivity, and electrification). And most differ from what traditional players have become used to refining for decades, such as a skill set around optimizing the development of internal combustion engines (ICEs).

Exhibit 2
 

 
Beyond building such a multitude of competencies, achieving at least a defensible position in-house for each of the four technology-driven trends would require an established automotive manufacturer to commit to investments totaling more than $70 billion. This conservative estimate is based on the probable number of attractive products a player would need to offer to compete in a given space and the necessary enablers required in bringing those products to market.
Our analysis found that the bulk of the cost of disruption will fall to players supporting traditional automotive business models that need to deploy significant capital to develop technologies while bringing new products and vehicle models to market. As such, building new electric-vehicle (xEV) platforms, converting existing ICE platforms, and rolling out semi- to fully autonomous technology to a sufficient number of models (as a share of the fleet of a typical mass-market OEM) may cost at least $55 billion over the next 15 years.
There is a lower cost to entry for new mobility business models, such as building a shared-mobility service in a specific region or developing a connectivity platform for in-vehicle services and advertising. To compete in just one of these two verticals, a company should be prepared to spend roughly $5 billion to $10 billion in the same time frame.
This is a high level of investment. And, as our estimates represent the likely overall cost of entry, further funds may be necessary to achieve a leading position in any one of the trends, as competitors will probably make similar moves simultaneously.
No single player is apt to “do it all,” so incumbents and new entrants alike will have to define their strategic posture clearly—that is, where they want to shape, follow, wait, or even exit the mobility industry. Defining this stance includes prioritizing core competencies and the areas of the mobility landscape they may occupy, identifying partnerships that will widen their reach, and mapping the path to their envisioned end state as a successful mobility player.
2. Choosing a mobility strategy based on a clear profile of qualifications
To build up the new mobility landscape, all segments in all five layers will have to be fully served (Exhibit 3). Individual players will have an ever-growing number of ways to compile their offers and define their mobility strategy in line with their aspirations.

Exhibit 3
 

Looking at the potential breadth of any actor’s portfolio, we see five strategic archetypes evolving. Each archetype looks quite different in its coverage of the personal-mobility landscape. Even within each of the archetypes, different subtypes can evolve, depending on where players decide to focus and how they fine-tune their approach (Exhibit 4).

Exhibit 4
 

To succeed within each archetype, players must carefully select and master a minimal set of technology and business-model competencies, as we outlined in Exhibit 2. For example, a “pointed niche” player may decide to bet on one trend—say, autonomous-driving technology—and therefore, depending on the planned focus, will need to cover all software-based front-end and back-end technology competencies. This player might need to build advanced machine-learning capabilities, double down on driving software, and create the relevant set of business-model competencies such as the effective processing of front-end offers.
To offer a complete and differentiated portfolio within a selected archetype, a company—such as the autonomous-driving niche player—will need to have a minimum profile of qualifications. Five characteristics should be considered in selecting the most suitable strategic archetype:

financial strength, that is, the minimum available funds and the ability to invest effectively in accordance with the selected strategy over the course of five to ten years
customer access, that is, the level to which one has wide access to the relevant base (for example, serving a broad range of different customers across segments, needs and wants, demographics, and geographies) or deep access to build relevant knowledge and serve effectively (for instance, understanding a specific customer type down to daily routines, individual wants, and needs)
talent access, that is, the opportunity to widely (across a broad range of disciplines) or deeply (through specific knowledge in a selected field) recruit and retain relevant talent—such as software engineers or designers—given the employer’s attractiveness
organizational agility, that is, the ability to quickly adapt significant parts of the organization to a rapidly changing company focus (by adopting structures, processes, or employee skills to new market requirements, for instance)
ecosystem embeddedness, that is, the extent to which one is or can be networked with relevant partners and vendors in a targeted field or the broader mobility landscape

Accordingly, each strategic archetype demands excellence across a unique combination of various competencies as well as specific qualifications (Exhibit 5). Players looking to be successful in a given archetype will need to build their capabilities with respect to their current individual portfolio of skills and assets.

Exhibit 5

Companies that understand their profile and the archetype requirements can quickly grasp when a specific strategy could be met or exceeded, or in which circumstances underdelivering might become a risk. Identifying individual nuances can clarify appropriate archetypes and then help players fine-tune their strategy once a choice has been made.
Imagine, for example, a company that aspires to become the standard provider for holistic autonomous-driving technology kits. The company has the necessary expertise in software, is well networked to also cover required hardware components, and has a strong employer and consumer brand. While this sounds promising for a holistic systems-player strategy, the company is also financially well-equipped and could therefore consider becoming an even broader player in the industry, potentially moving into the domain of a fully integrated mobility player instead of focusing on a single system. It is then up to the company to evaluate its strategic posture and preferred way of moving forward in the new mobility landscape.
3. Forming the right partnerships for managing reach across technologies and business models
Besides gaining clarity on where and how they want to position themselves, players need to think about how they can extend their reach in the mobility landscape and build relevant partnerships for future success. We have identified 13 types of partnerships, each of which offers a specific approach to help manage a player’s reach across technologies and business models, and to create and capture additional value (Exhibit 6).

Exhibit 6
 

Partnerships, by nature, are unlikely to be a fixed construct. They may vary by area of the mobility landscape, as well as by the core competencies they are best suited to cover. For example, dedicated partnerships for setting new standards in the industry may, generally speaking, be well suited to cover technology and business-model topics but should ideally be oriented toward disruptive offers, such as how to think about and handle the deployment of robo-taxis, once available. By contrast, partnerships on synergetic product offers primarily focus on expanding business based on existing technologies and thus can be optimally used for a gradual transition into more disruptive business models.
At the same time, as new partnerships grow more mature, they will probably include more elements of capturing existing value, even if they originally set out with the goal of creating entirely new value pools. Consider a newly established platform for sharing data on autonomous-vehicle behavior: while at the beginning such a partnership may be focused on opening up new opportunities for its contributors, it may shift toward securing the created—and potentially other existing—value pools.
Selecting where to partner, the most suitable type of partnership, and the right structure will not be straightforward as the industry becomes more complex and diverse. Players will presumably face an increasing number of potential partners across all layers of the mobility landscape and from a large set of industries that are all looking to serve the mobility end consumer.
Not surprisingly, we already observe many new offers stemming from rather unconventional partnerships in the mobility space. Take, for instance, competitors collaborating on high-definition maps or new players from different industries such as retail and fashion building on opportunities from fully connected vehicles and car data-enabled services (for more, see sidebar “Example partnership models around Lyft”).

To accelerate autonomous-vehicle (AV) technology, Lyft taps into a broad network of partners. As part of its approach, the company established an open AV platform allowing its partners (automakers GM and Jaguar Land Rover, start-ups Drive.ai and nuTonomy, and Google’s self-driving division Waymo) to test their autonomous fleets on its ride-hailing platform, granting access to its network of riders. Furthermore, Lyft is working with partners like nuTonomy on enhancing the end-to-end passenger experience for autonomous vehicles. Lyft recently announced it would also develop its own autonomous-driving software and hardware components and have its partners integrate this technology into vehicles.
On the business-building side, collaborations are numerous. Most notably, Lyft partners with Chinese Didi and Grab as platform players in separate markets offering its customers a seamless ridesharing experience beyond the United States, in Asia. Several partnerships exist with insurance and travel companies to provide “last-mile transportation” where offerings are synergetic—for instance, from the train station home or to the doctor’s office. Additionally, Lyft partners with fast-food providers and the American Automobile Association (AAA) to boost ridesharing as an alternative to the conventional car-rental business.

As advances in mobility continue, we expect more and rather diverse partnerships to evolve. For example, multiple industry players have already started discussing the need for autonomous-vehicle remote-control centers, which would serve to help navigate highly autonomous cars in unexpected or emergency situations. Such centers could play a crucial role in getting autonomous technology off the ground and achieving an initial, critical level of adoption, for example, through providing consumers and safety authorities with a sense of security, knowing there is a defined fallback mechanism to start with. A variety of stakeholders, including regulators, fleet operators, and AV-system providers, may be interested in controlling these centers in the future.
On a less concrete level, we could include making electric vehicles serve as mobile power banks for businesses and private households, leveraging autonomous vehicles for more attractive storage or even real-estate deals, or basing entire interior-design businesses on equipping purpose-built vehicles of all kinds. However such partnerships are structured, the future is likely to bring interesting collaborations to benefit the industry and end consumers.
4. Actively transitioning from the traditional automotive world to the new mobility landscape
Beyond looking at how to choose the right strategy and partnerships, we also need to acknowledge the automotive revolution as a fundamental transformation of the industry. In our perspective, players should approach it as such—and the rules of transformational change still apply (see sidebar “Key considerations for a successful transformation”).


Thriving in the emerging mobility landscape requires not just fundamental change but also strategic change. Industry players who make five deliberate decisions stand the best chance of a successful transformation that results in sustainable profitability:

Set the right overarching goals, including the right organizational aspirations for the future.
Determine and tackle the technical, managerial, and behavioral gaps between today’s state and the future vision (including a clear plan for capital expenditure and investment).
Develop a portfolio of clear initiatives to grow into new performance spaces, and structure the implementation of initiatives in ways that attract and motivate the right talent.
Design a rollout plan, and account for broad ownership and thoughtful stakeholder management throughout the transition.
Set mechanisms for continuous improvement and innovation, as well as for developing and enabling leaders to keep driving the required changes.



This may sound like any another transformation, but for the automotive revolution, it will be particularly crucial to draw attention to the business-case element of the upcoming transition. Financial decisions will have to be made in light of the need to serve two worlds: the traditional automotive business, which will still make up a sizable portion of the industry by 2030, and the disruptive, technology-driven trends, which will grow to take over the mobility industry. Defining the right balance across when, where, and how to invest in one field or divest from another will be of the utmost importance.
The impact can be immense, and players in the new mobility ecosystem have very different starting positions based on their current roles and competencies. To quantify the potential evolution of profitability and investment, we ran a war-game simulation that modeled the potential decisions of various players hundreds of times and assessed the effect of competitive dynamics on profitability (Exhibit 7). Through this analysis, we identified three core components of decision making that seem to help determine success:

Investment focus. This entails weighing the trade-offs and taking a considered approach on whether to be balanced across exposure to disruptive trends or to focus more on narrow competencies.
Investment timing. The second component involves managing long lead times for technology development and market entry while staggering high-cost investments and deciding whether to front-run industry developments or take a fast-follower approach.
Agile organizations. Major events, such as regulatory decisions or the entrance of one or two large players into a market, can disrupt a company’s long-term investment strategy while reducing market share and creating downward pressure on margins. Agile organizations must first anticipate and second react to this risk, specifically when significant amounts of capital and corporate focus are committed to one space.


Exhibit 7
 

Looking at average performance and top performers across numerous simulations, we also see how fundamental dynamics for different player types inform various strategies:

New mobility and platform players. New mobility players start from a position of tight profits and constrained cash flow, but with organizations that are potentially quite agile. These players could see massive expansion of their current profits, achieving growth of a hundred times or more. However, they must carefully position themselves to respond aggressively to potential new entrants and changing regulation that could dethrone them.
New technology and specialist players. Large technology players and specialized companies focused on bringing one or two disruptive technologies to market have the luxury of timing and targeting their go-to-market strategy while working with numerous players to scale technologies and profits across large volumes. For these players, a variety of approaches proved successful; whether manufacturing lithium-ion batteries, developing connectivity platforms, creating in-vehicle-services ecosystems, or even rolling out a shared-mobility fleet, all generated strong returns in competitive environments. With access to large amounts of capital—giving them the ability to decide when to enter, if at all—the key obstacle these players needed to overcome was the ability to identify sufficient OEM partners and the best business models. In our testing, only 30 percent of the simulated companies were able to both enter the automotive market and generate long-term profits.
Automotive OEMs. Automotive manufacturers faced a more varied path to long-term profits. High levels of fixed capital, long product cycles, and the need to transition to new technologies in the face of an uncertain future mean shareholders of some companies may need to prepare for an intense phase of capital redistribution and pressure on profitability. In our simulations, we still saw various decisions leading to success, but close to half of all simulated strategies resulted in negative or neutral profit growth.
Many large OEMs diversified their bets across a range of powertrain and autonomous systems, keeping core intellectual property and investments in-house and staggering their investments to minimize risk and spread costs. However, in some successful paths, OEMs achieved an even more radical transformation of their businesses, divesting tens of billions of capital from their core ICE business as they shifted large portions of the portfolio to xEVs and advanced autonomous vehicles while rolling out their own mobility platforms.
Smaller OEMs, including emerging-market players and niche-market specialists, were forced to sharpen their focus if they were to succeed. In some instances this meant falling back on producing the core vehicle, while strategically sourcing high-volume disruptive technologies (such as partially autonomous driving systems and hybrid propulsion) to grow their market share at the cost of a substantial profit give-back to the system suppliers. Other OEMs created outsize growth by focusing on one disruptive technology, such as battery electric vehicles or fully autonomous vehicles, building a brand and being first to market at the expense of all other potentially addressable segments.




Our simulations revealed a wide variation in the ability to grow profit across types of players and strategies as the industry goes through a wide-reaching disruption and transformation.
Many of these outcomes themselves were critically sensitive not only to the actions of others and the evolution of overall industry structure but also to exogenous shocks. In the war game, a battery manufacturer could achieve substantial returns by investing in a multibillion-dollar battery-manufacturing facility and supplying to one or two mass-market OEMs. This investment would fail absent the ongoing and increasing regulatory support for xEVs; alternatively, it could generate 30 percent greater returns through improved battery chemistry. Similarly, the success of fully autonomous vehicles represents a paradigm shift for shared-mobility players’ revenues and profits, but technology failure or regulation delaying the rollout could keep that business on a more conservative long-term path and lead to negative returns for players heavily invested in the technology.
The level of uncertainty facing many of these major investments is significant. While our analysis suggests the existence of winning paths, the road to the future is uncharted. But the four key actions we explored here could help players navigate in the emerging mobility landscape. Staying flexible while at the same time learning to operate based on probabilities will continue to increase in importance.

As the pace of technological change in the industry accelerates, we believe the question is no longer whether the disruption will occur. Rather, it’s how quickly and to what extent players will have to reimagine their businesses to serve the mobility consumer of the future. The new landscape will require new technologies, competencies, and partners, while still relying on traditional businesses and products as part of the solution.
The size and potential impact of the automotive revolution requires more than gut feeling to drive the right decisions for a successful mobility strategy. Only a good understanding of the potential outcomes and a data-driven mind-set can enable actors to adjust to the full impact of the disruption on their business. War games, such as the one we conducted, seek not to forecast the future but to simulate a range of possible scenarios and understand how they could affect the profitability of a variety of players. They also allow companies to test their strategies in the face of an uncertain future and enable key decision makers to approach impending changes with an industry-wide perspective.
We hope this article encourages organizations to think about probable futures, decisions, strategic alternatives, the moves of other players, and the importance of a future-oriented vision. The next 15 years will usher in a new mobility landscape, with large shifts in the deployment of capital and the capture of profits. Navigating what’s ahead will require businesses to approach the market with a long-term vision and to clearly communicate with shareholders and partners about the road ahead.

As mentioned in Forbes, rapid battery cost declines, rising commitment from major automakers, strong policy support from state and local governments, and low operational costs (including discounted charging tariffs from utilities) have put electric vehicles (EVs) on track to pass gasoline-powered vehicles.
Given these advantages, global car manufacturers are finally waking up to the EV revolution.
The last couple of months have been very exciting: first Volvo said it would stop making cars powered only by fossil fuels within two years.
Then Jaguar and Land Rover announced similar plans.   .
Mercedes-Benz said it will electrify its entire car lineup by 2022.
By now all traditional automakers have all stepped up their push to go electric….and yerterday Barron´s published this title: “Electric Vehicles: A Trigger For Traditional Automakers’ Collapse?”

Mexico is living a revolution in the use of the private cars: Carrot launched a new service to share private cars, like a sort of Airbnb but in car sharing. According to the company, private cars are not used for almost 90% of their time. Carrot wants to create a platform that can help owners to share their cars with potential users. The system is quite simple: the owner establishes how much he wants to gain for the renting, and the company gets a percentage of the revenue.
In Europe, we have seen companies like Omoove presenting a technology that can help to manage this business idea. Sharemine is a shared mobility platform for micro-small-and medium operators that allows simple creation of car sharing or ridesharing communities.
Sharemine is a web-based tool, which provides individuals and companies with the ability to create and monitor car sharing and ridesharing communities. It works for parents’ trip-sharing for the school run and sporting events to friends co-ordinating travel plans to less accessible locations. Sharemine is also of great benefit to owners and operators of vehicle fleets, particularly small and medium enterprises.
The community is fully configurable and the dashboard allows tracking of the number of users and vehicles currently active, as well as drivers, riders, bookings and travel in progress. It also allows rental or ride revenue to be tracked according to rates defined by the community manager. Based on community manager preference, Sharemine allows the inclusion of insurance telematics capabilities based on Octo technology to encourage safer driving and ensure that drivers are benefitting from their good driving behaviours.

According to Barra, “By working together, we can solve these challenges and deliver safer, better and more sustainable transportation solutions for all of our customers. GM’s vision is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. We are working on the technologies that will create this future, blending global insights with local market expertise as the automotive industry transforms from traditional manufacturing to transportation services.
GM believes the future of personal mobility will be driven by the convergence of electrification, autonomous vehicles, and connectivity and shared mobility services. China is playing a key role in the company’s strategy.”



Bullish on electrification
Electrification is an important element of GM’s global strategy to reduce CO2 emissions, reduce petroleum use and help customers save money. “Our modern-day leadership in electrification is not new,” said Barra. “Our engineers have continually built upon our experience.”
The Chevrolet Bolt EV introduced in the U.S. late last year achieves about 383km of range per charge and has already logged 45 million kilometres on the road. Like the U.S., China is a key market for GM’s electrification solutions. Between 2016 and 2020, GM is rolling out at least 10 new energy vehicles (NEVs) in China. They include the Cadillac CT6 Plug-In, the Buick Velite 5 extended-range electric vehicle and the Baojun E100 electric vehicle, which have all been introduced locally within the past 12 months.
By 2025, nearly all models from GM’s global brands in China – Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet – will offer electrification technology. To support GM’s growing NEV fleet planned for China, its SAIC-GM joint venture is opening a new battery assembly plant in Shanghai this year.
Autonomous driving for safer transportation
For years, automakers committed resources to protecting passengers when crashes happen. GM says self-driving cars can significantly avoid accidents and crashes caused by human behaviour, and eventually lead to safer transportation.
In June, GM became the first automaker to use mass-production methods for autonomous vehicles. One hundred-thirty autonomous test vehicles equipped with GM’s next generation of self-driving technology were produced at Orion Assembly Plant in Michigan and joined the more than 50 autonomous vehicles already deployed in testing fleets in San Francisco; Scottsdale, Arizona; and metro Detroit.
The company is also developing advanced driver assist systems that will form the foundation for self-driving vehicles. GM has been testing and validating Super Cruise hand-free driving assistance technology in the U.S. and China. It will first be rolled out later this year in the U.S. in the Cadillac CT6 and introduced in a future Cadillac product in China.
Connectivity and sharing to relieve congestion
According to Barra, customers do not just appreciate connected vehicles, they demand them. Shared, autonomous vehicles have the potential to greatly reduce congestion in large cities such as Shanghai while still providing on-demand transportation.
GM, which has been engaged in the connectivity space for more than 20 years through OnStar, already has more than a million customers. GM’s goal is to have all of its Cadillac, Buick and Chevrolet models in China connected by 2020.
This is setting the stage for deploying connected vehicle technology to improve safety and relieve congestion by allowing vehicles to communicate with one another and the infrastructure. Vehicle to Everything (V2X) represents one of rthe company’s most promising solutions. GM has been helping lead the development of China’s V2X application layer standard. It is also one of the authors of the China Intelligent and Connected Vehicle Road Map, which provides a guideline for the R&D activities of manufacturers and future policy development by the government.
GM says its investment in China’s leading car-sharing technology provider Yi Wei Xing and a vehicle sharing pilot program with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, which completed in May, are helping GM to better understand how customers in China can use urban mobility vehicles in a real-world setting and a vehicle-sharing arrangement – to turn potential sustainable mobility solutions into reality.
“GM and our joint ventures are committed to providing world-class products for our customers in China, as well as the technical and business expertise to lead in the future of personal mobility.” said Barra. “No single company or organisation has all the answers to the challenges we currently face or expect to face in the future.”
Barra is participating in the International Business Leaders Advisory Council for the Mayor of Shanghai (IBLAC) on September 17. She will share GM’s global perspectives with the Shanghai government as it strives to be a leader in green and intelligent transportation, and achieve its goal of being a global city of excellence.

Car sharing services gain momentum as a potential alternative to various modes of transportation, including privately owned cars. This trend goes hand in hand with a renewed interest in the sharing economy, which has as essential premise that product ownership is of minor relevance. Using an online experiment, this study investigates if individual differences in psychological ownership influence the effects of well-known instrumental car attributes (price, parking convenience, and car type) on people’s intentions to select a shared car. Results confirmed that instrumental attributes generally impact preferences for car sharing services, and that a low psychological ownership may lead to a higher preference for a shared car under specific circumstances. This suggests that not only instrumental car attributes, but also psychological disposition, specifically psychological ownership, of potential customers need to be taken into consideration when developing measures to stimulate car sharing services in society.
1.1. The sharing economy and car sharing service
The sharing economy is an economic arrangement between actors who share underutilized assets – i.e., products that people own but do not frequently use – in the marketplace (Bardhi and Eckhardt, 2012; Cohen and Kietzmann, 2014 ;  Sundararajan, 2016). Information technology has enabled the widespread adoption of sharing economy principles (Martin, 2016) by allowing individuals to communicate, coordinate and build trust with others in a large public arena (Albinsson & Perera, 2012). As a novel and sustainable alternative to traditional consumption models, the sharing economy, like related concepts such as collaborative consumption (Botsman & Rogers, 2010), and market-mediated access-based consumption (Bardhi & Eckhardt, 2012), has been suggested as an appropriate response to the environmental challenges posed by overconsumption and overexploitation of resources (Hamari, Sjöklint, & Ukkonen, 2016). The adoption of sharing economy principles enables people to “leverage [their] lifestyles beyond individual possibilities” (Belk, 2007, p. 134), which in the long term is assumed to result in improved societal welfare (Fraiberger & Sundararajan, 2015).
The recent interest in the sharing economy is visible in domains ranging from tourism (e.g. Airbnb) to consumer goods (e.g. Pley), but also in transportation through the introduction of car sharing services (e.g. Car2Go, Zipcar, and Getaround; cf. Belk, 2014 ;  Bardhi and Eckhardt, 2012). The earliest car sharing program in history was the cooperative Sefage, introduced in Zurich, Switzerland in 1948 ( Shaheen, Sperling, & Wagner, 1999). Other well-known European car sharing initiatives were introduced in the early 1970s, such as Witkar in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and Procotip in Montpellier, France ( Millard-Ball, Murray, Ter Schure, Fox, & Burkhardt, 2005). Yet, only recently, car sharing services have really become popular, with estimated car sharing memberships of 12 million in 2020– a significant increase from 2.3 million that was reported in 2013 (Cohen & Kietzmann, 2014).
Car sharing services hold great promise for sustainability and individual mobility alike. Studies estimate that a single shared car can replace between nine and thirteen private cars (Martin et al., 2010), given that a private car is primarily used for a mere 5% of the time (Ballús-Armet, Shaheen, Clonts, & Weinzimmer, 2014). Reducing – or even to some extent replacing – private car ownership would contribute to the reduction of air pollution, traffic congestion, and the increase of parking spots availability (Efthymiou, Antoniou, & Waddell, 2013). Car sharing services allow for rationalization of unnecessary trips, which contributes towards pollution reduction by as much as 56% (Shaheen & Cohen, 2013). Moreover, car sharing services can complement public transportation, particularly in providing mobility services in those trips which are typically only suited for car driving (De Lorimier & El-Geneidy, 2013), reducing the need to have private cars and increasing the access to mobility to many.
1.2. Attributes of vehicle driving
Prior research has identified three major factors influencing people’s preferences for vehicle use: price, parking convenience, and car type. For starters, transportation research reports that price is an important attribute for car users. Regardless of income level, people generally consider the cost for their choice of taking a car (Gardner & Abraham, 2007). The influence of price on transportation preferences equally applies to car sharing services (cf. Lamberton & Rose, 2012). Duncan (2011) indicates that it is generally cheaper to choose a shared car than to drive a private car. The total costs of driving a private car are high, due to the fixed cost of car purchase and variable costs of fuel, parking and maintenance costs. Car sharing services, in contrast, only charge membership and usage cost for an individual trip, and are in fact so cheap that they are financially within reach of many people who cannot afford a car, such as students and low-income individuals (De Luca & Di Pace, 2015). Most research, however, has focused on the characteristics of car sharing services without considering the possibility of making a trip with a privately owned car. As an exception, De Luca and Di Pace (2015) found that an increase in the price of a car sharing service reduces the willingness to switch from private car to a car sharing service. Price therefore plays a major role in the decision whether someone will select a car sharing service rather than a private car for an intended trip.
It is also well-documented that people are primarily attracted to modes of transportation that are not too far away from them (Brown et al., 2016). In a car driving context, accessibility is typically translated into parking convenience: the more difficult it is to find a parking place the less likely people will take a car for a trip (De Lorimier & El-Geneidy, 2013). Applied to car sharing services, Litman (2000) suggested that to be a viable alternative to a private car, car sharing services must be within walking distance from a user’s location. Some anecdotal evidence exists that car sharing services are more attractive to a potential client, if parking places are included in the service (Kaspi, Raviv, & Tzur, 2014); people do not use a shared car service when the parking location of the shared car is further away (De Luca & Di Pace, 2015). It thus makes sense to predict that parking convenience will play a major role in the decision whether someone will select a car sharing service for an intended trip.
Car manufacturers, such as BMW and Tesla, invest in electric mobility ( Hidrue, Parsons, Kempton, & Gardner, 2011) and several governments currently incentivize the use of EVs in the hope to overcome overdependence on fossil fuel (Cartenì, Cascetta, & de Luca, 2016). In daily practice, however, people often express concerns against electric vehicles – among others regarding the less sustainable nature of their manufacturing process and electricity sources (cf., Hawkins, Singh, Majeau-Bettez, & Strømman, 2013). Contrary to such concerns, some scholars are now exploring the viability and environmental benefits of electric vehicles as an alternative to traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars in car sharing systems (Kim, Ko, & Park, 2015). The evidence on the contribution of electric car type on the willingness to select a car sharing service is mixed. A study by Cartenì et al. (2016) suggests that EV fleets in car sharing services have a positive influence on people’s decision to join the service. Given that some people are attracted to services that signal their ‘green’ identity (Griskevicius et al., 2010), we predict that similar considerations apply to car sharing, such that offering an EV as an alternative to the traditional ICE car type will play an important role in influencing people’s intentions to select a shared car.

Ridesharing with social contacts (i.e., ‘friends’) is substantially more accepted than with strangers. However, limiting ridesharing to friends while rejecting strangers also reduces ride choices and increases detour costs. This work studies, from a theoretical perspective, whether the additional detour costs of limiting shared rides to social network contacts would be prohibitive. It proposes a social network based ridesharing algorithm with heterogeneous detour tolerances for varied social contacts. The theoretical matching rates and detour costs are compared in a simulation for three levels of social connectivity: travelling with direct contacts only, with direct and indirect contacts, or with anyone. The simulation allows for a systematic and comprehensive testing of system behaviour when varying the parameters of social network structure, detour tolerance, and spatial distribution of friendship. Results show that for a clustered friendship – the expected spatial distribution of a social network growing with a ride-sharing network – ridesharing with friends does not cause significantly higher costs. Furthermore, the algorithm prioritising friends can substantially increase the matching of friends. An empirical study justifies the findings.
1. Introduction
The growing amount of cars on the road results in increasing congestion of urban traffic, which then leads to higher fuel consumption, longer average travel time, more environmental pollution, and less patience of people with their daily travel (International Transport Forum, 2013). One known way to reduce the traffic load on the road without harming accessibility is looking for higher occupancy rates per vehicle, i.e., through ridesharing. Trajectory analysis has indicated good chances of ridesharing according to space-time concurrence (Santi et al., 2014). But despite the environmental and economic benefits, there is still a low rate in participation of ridesharing (Amey, 2010; Chaube, Kavanaugh, & Pérez-Quiñones, 2010; Wessels, 2009). The contradiction is partially due to the strong reluctance to share rides with strangers according to some surveys (Chaube et al., 2010; Wessels, 2009). The low willingness for ridesharing with strangers signifies that many of the existing ride opportunities, according to trajectory overlap, are actually inacceptable for a certain person. The preference for travelling with social contacts (a first or second degree socially connected person, hereafter called “friend”) seems to be a good reason to limit ridesharing to friends. Realising this argument, Facebook filed recently a patent called “Event-based ride-sharing” (Richardson, Petrescu, & Finch, 2016), which allows drivers to select users based on his/her social network connections for an online negotiation on carpooling to an event.
However, a ridesharing system limited to friends has yet to address the impact of missing chances of getting a ride. Ridesharing exclusively with friends while declining offers from strangers may lead to fewer opportunities to get a ride within a given space-time budget and to higher detour costs. This study aims to examine the theoretical costs and benefits of ridesharing with friends by systematic and comprehensive variation of parameters in a simulation beyond a particular context. Empirical tests are run as validations. As social networks are gaining attention in travel behaviour research (Arentze & Timmermans, 2008; Hackney & Marchal, 2011), this work helps gain insightful understanding into how spatial structures of social networks affect ridesharing results.

India’s automotive transition will happen from ICE (internal combustion engine) to hybrid vehicles to BEV (battery electric vehicles). This trend will be more visible in two-wheelers, three-wheelers and passenger vehicles while commercial vehicles, tractors and medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCVs) will take longer for the transition, says a survey for ACMA conducted by McKinsey & Co titled “Future of E-mobility.”
The survey was released at the 57th annual session of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA), the apex body of the auto component industry in India, in New Delhi on September 8.
The study reveals that globally, majority of experts believe that the auto industry will be disrupted with trends like shared mobility, autonomous driving, connectivity and electrification in our future vehicles.
These trends will have a major impact on the value chain, resulting in market shift and revenue pools. The role of OEMs and suppliers will fade by 2030, leading to an emergence of new players, gaining a significant share of revenues and profits of the automotive industry. The driving force towards this change in mobility will be collaboration and innovation with auto suppliers.
Vishvajit Sahay, joint secretary, department of heavy industries, Government of India, said, “The auto industry plays an important role in contributing to the country’s GDP where it contributes 7.1% and out of this auto component contributes 2.1% upwards. The Indian automotive industry is poised to change now. We need to view this change as an opening of new opportunities.”
“For this the industry needs to be not only technology-ready, but also capacity-ready. To be able to succeed in doing so we need to acquire & train the workforce while creating new avenues for skill development as well. The government expects the automobile industry to act as the prime contributor to the Make in India movement and is ready to support the industry in every possible manner,” he said
On the front of e-mobility Rattan Kapur, president, ACMA, said, “We at ACMA believe that while the future is electric, the logical progression would be to move from IC-engines to hybrids and then to fully battery based vehicles. This will provide the local industry with the opportunity to develop and best acquire technologies for the future generation of vehicles.”
“A long-term stable technology-agnostic roadmap for the automotive industry driven by a sound regulatory framework is therefore the need of the hour so that the industry can invest for sustainable growth and development, in line with the aspirations of all stakeholders,” he said.
“There is a fundamental need to preserve the environment for our future generations and are committed to it. For the auto component industry this may imply drastic changes for many individual players. Time has come for each of us in the industry to accept this new business environment and gear ourselves to cater to the new demands of the future,” Kapur added.
Commenting on the future of mobility, Abhay Firodia, president SIAM & chairman of Force Motors, said, “Today, we stand facing a massive technological transformation, which is coming our way. This leap towards e-mobility is bound to happen sooner or later, the correct way to do it would be a gradual transition. Policy environment should lead to the betterment of the nation and its customers. These new technologies already exist and are reasonably mature and can be implemented in a matter of few years but the industry needs clarity so that both OEMs and auto component manufacturers could plan for the change accordingly.”
In his keynote address, R C Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, said, “As the vehicle population is increasing, the need to import the crude oil is also increasing. Crude oil being a non-renewable resource is limited in nature, thereby, building a need to shift to a more sustainable and environment friendly alternative. It is in our government’s long-term interest to accept electric mobility as an alternate means of transport and we as an industry need to acknowledge the challenge to make it happen. However, there are a few challenges, which need to be addressed before we embark on the journey of electric mobility for India.”
“Firstly, battery is the main element of electric vehicles and it is the low cost of battery that will determine the sales of the vehicle, and secondly, the charging infrastructure should be available for the convenience of using the vehicle. The government of India is also strategising on an innovative idea of battery swapping which needs to be looked upon. To make this shift, we need to work together with the government and see what impact does the EV policy has on its customers in the future.”
The survey revealed that e-mobility is already shaping the automotive industry around the world and in India. On the dimension of innovation, the best should be extracted out of internal and external partnership sources.
Also, all stakeholders should work together to formulate policies that support indigenous development of technology over import dependence. The need of the hour is sustainability over speed.
In the case of India, four key forces could determine the future e-mobility landscape:

Regulations and incentives: Many countries have promoted e-mobility through a range of incentives, but these alone do not drive EV penetration. A supportive ecosystem that also establishes strict regulations on carbon emissions indirectly prompts the higher adoption of EVs.
 Technology: Improved technology can reduce battery costs, increase efficiency and driving range, making EVs more accessible and attractive to potential customers.

Infrastructure: Easy and affordable access to charging infrastructure – both standard AC charging as well as rapid DC charging – is a key to meet customer needs.
 Customer demand: Creating a pull among customers by creating an economical cost proposition will be crucial in encouraging customers to invest in EVs.

A new study is showing consumers are starting to prefer shared mobility services over owning a car and stopping off at a gas station.
The study by University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, Texas A&M Transportation Institute, and Columbia University, surveyed more than 1,200 people in Austin, Texas. They wanted to find out how their transportation habits changed after ride-hailing giants Uber and Lyft left the city.
Uber and Lyft had pulled out the Austin, Texas, market last year right after their ballot measure failed in a local election. Voters had blocked them from using their own background-check systems to bring in drivers, avoiding the strict guidelines governing the taxi and livery industry.

The university researchers found that 41 percent of the respondents went back to using their own vehicle to fill the void, and only nine percent went out and bought a car for their mobility needs. About 3 percent chose public transit, and 42 percent switched to another smaller local mobility startup serving the market.
There were 12 app-based startups trying to fill the void once Uber and Lyft left the market. Most are gone, but a few are still in business in Austin.
Researchers found that Austin survey respondents who had transitioned to a personal vehicle were 23-times more likely to take more trips than those who had switched to a startup ride-hailing firm. Trips went way down after Uber and Lyft left the city — the average frequency on trips went from 5.65 times per month to 2.01. That took a 68 percent drop.
Researchers in this, and other, studies are finding that ride-hailing, ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft and their competitors around the world as seeing explosive growth. That’s the case in the car-sharing space as well, where companies like Zipcar, Car2Go, and Maven are adding more locations in cities around the world.
This has to do primarily with numerous studies showing that young people are moving into cities, getting their driver’s licenses much later or not at all, and are using alternative transportation modes including bus and rail, ride-hailing, car sharing, and riding their bicycles.
Analysts are making predictions about revolutionary changes spreading across the world over the next 10-to-20 years in autonomous vehicles, shared rides, and rapid train systems such as Hyperloop. These studies predict that new vehicle sales will be dropping dramatically, along with gasoline consumption.
“On-demand, ride-sourcing services have grown tremendously in the last decade and they promise a host of potential public benefits — reduced energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, easing of road congestion, as well as affordability, and accessibility,” said Robert Hampshire, a professor at UMTRI and lead author of the Austin study.
Demand for Uber and Lyft have been strong enough for the state of Texas to override Austin and other cities. In late May, Uber and Lyft relaunched their services in Austin, in response to the state adopting Texas House Bill 100. The new law overrides local ordinances, and creates statewide regulations governing transportation network companies.
Mobility companies are playing a leading role in the future of self-driving vehicles. Analysts predict that consumers will prefer having a self-driving car that they don’t own come pick them up for short trips – instead of having to make car payments, buy gasoline, and find and pay for expensive parking.
Automakers like Ford, General Motors, and Volkswagen, are getting into the game by starting up or acquiring mobility companies and tying it into testing self-driving cars.
General Motors plans to deploy thousands of self-driving Chevrolet Bolt electric cars in test fleets in partnership with Lyft, beginning in 2018. GM took an ownership stake in Lyft last year.
GM’s fairly new car-sharing division, Maven, is seeing its business take off in the past year throughout North America.
The company recently started Maven Gig, a car-sharing service aimed at drivers working for Uber and Lyft, along with those driving for delivery services such as Postmates, GrubHub, and Instacart. Maven Gig started up in Los Angeles and is spreading to Boston, Phoenix, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Detroit.
The service is aimed at the “gig economy,” serving workers who don’t own a vehicle but need to make income driving for one or more of the popular mobility services in their market. They can rent a Chevy Bolt through Maven Gig for $229-a-week. The weekly fee includes insurance, maintenance, and electric vehicle charging.

Self-driving car: Chevy Bolt clone being readied to deliver Level 4 autonomy but only when legislation allows. Andrew Tolve reports.
Ready or not, the world is about to get a mass-produced self-driving car. Cruise Automation and its parent company General Motors have locked in a design that they say they’re prepared to build hundreds of thousands of each year. It’s a dead-ringer for the newest version of the Bolt EV but comes with a third-generation Cruise self-driving platform, along with a suite of sensors that make it capable of Level 4 autonomous driving. Fifty of the cars have already been manufactured at GM’s plant in Orion, Michigan.

There’s a few caveats here. The first is that while the vehicle may be capable of full autonomy it won’t actually be driving public roads en masse without drivers behind the wheel until Cruise and GM deploy the proper software updates and the government gives it the proper regulatory approval – both of which could take years. Also, these vehicles won’t be destined for dealership forecourts; they’ll be integrated into the Cruise Anywhere ride-hailing platform that is currently being piloted with Cruise employees in San Francisco. Cruise says that it plans to begin piloting the platform with the general public soon and has designs on taking it national thereafter.
Lastly, despite Cruise’s claims that this will be the first mass-produced self-driving car on the market, Elon Musk would like to remind you that the Tesla Model 3, in production at the moment, is expected to enter mass production by the end of 2017, is equally decked out with all the sensors and software needed for full autonomy.
In other news, Samsung announced at the Frankfurt Auto Show that it wants in on the race for self-driving cars and it has set aside $300M (£220M) to turbocharge its efforts. The Samsung Automotive Innovation Fund will invest in game-changing technologies for connected cars and autonomous vehicles. Samsung recently secured a license to start piloting self-driving technology in California and South Korea. In March it completed its $8Bn (£5.88Bn) acquisition of Harman, which it also plans to exploit in pursuing connected services for the automotive market.
Also in Frankfurt Hyundai announced that it will launch an electric car sharing programme in metropolitan Amsterdam in early October. The carmaker was silent on much of the programme’s details but says it will consist of 100 Ioniq EVs that can travel 280 km on a single charge.
Mercedes-Benz is switching up how drivers navigate in its updated infotainment system due out next year. The system will include a global addressing system called what3words that divides the world into 3m x 3m squares, each with a unique address made of three dictionary words.  Drivers will thus be able to type or say three words to pinpoint an exact destination anywhere in the world, even if it doesn’t have a street address, and receive turn-by-turn directions.
SEAT will be the first car brand in Europe to integrate Amazon’s Alexa voice service in its vehicles. The Alexa service will allow drivers to manage their personal schedule, find songs and locate points of interest, real-time news or the nearest dealership, to name a few of the capabilities. Alexa will be available in the Leon and Ateca models, and in the Ibiza, Arona and the large SUV in 2018.
Audi has revealed that its new A8 will feature a conversational automotive assistant that listens, understands and responds to drivers.Nuance Communications’ Dragon Drive connected car platform will power the assistant, using a blend of cloud-based speech recognition, natural language understanding and text-to-speech. Drivers will be able to do everything from control their air conditioning to check on weather and POIs to choose songs. The assistant will be integrated into other Audi models in 2018.
IBM announced that it’s partnering with ZF and UBS to bring Car eWallet to market. The solution allows autonomous vehicles to make secure, cashless, on-the-go payments for highway tolls, parking and electric charging without requiring any action from the owner. The platform is built on IBM Blockchain and delivered via IBM Cloud.
On the cyber security front, IBM and Irdeto are partnering to offer carmakers real-time monitoring of their electronic control units. Attempts to modify or reverse engineer software on the ECU will be pinged by Irdeto’s Cloakware Secure Environment solution and sent via telemetry to IBM’s QRadar solution, which will keep carmakers up to speed on the situation in a dashboard format and advise them whether to address the attack with an automated response or a manual intervention.
Tier 1 suppliers Honeywell and Lear are offering a more expansive solution that monitors the entire ecosystem of a connected vehicle, across all of its defined attack surfaces that can provide a point of entry to hackers. The solution will pair Honeywell’s intrusion detection technology software and security operations centres with Lear’s automotive electrical distribution systems and connected gateway expertise.
Finally, TomTom announced a new service aimed at curbing range anxiety. The TomTom EV Service helps EV drivers make informed decisions about when and where to charge their vehicles by providing real-time availability for charging points, as well as other essential information such as opening hours, payment methods and plug types. The TomTom service will launch in Europe this year with expansion to North America in 2018.

The cost to carshare is falling down.
In this study, the researchers Joseph Schwieterman and Alice Bieszczat – from DePaul University, Chicago – explore the changing prices and level of taxation for carsharing in the United States through a review of hourly rates in 80 cities with Zipcar pods, as well as at U.S. locations served by car2go and Maven. The base rate for a one-hour Zipcar carshare between 2011 and 2016 is shown to have fallen from $9.39 to $8.92, a 5.0% drop. In inflation-adjusted terms, this constitutes an 11.2% real reduction. Retail taxes over the period, however, rose from 15.5% to 17.0%, offsetting almost one third of the price reduction. In some cities, taxes on one-hour reservations exceed 30% due to transaction-based fees that apply regardless of the duration of the trip. Interpreted broadly, these results indicate that carsharing is becoming more affordable to urban consumers, while being subject to extensive competition and facing the burden of extensive retail taxes that may hamper efforts to achieve local sustainability goals.
To measure the prices and tax burden facing carsharing, the lowest-priced vehicle available and taxes and fees added by government agencies were recorded at locations throughout the United States. Reservations were made for a compact vehicle, such as a Honda Civic, which are common across fleets. The sample consists of price measurements at a representative pod in 80 cities falling into one of two categories: i) the 40 most populous U.S. cities, all of which have populations of 300,000 or more, in which neighborhood carsharing is available through car2go, Maven, and/or Zipcar, and ii) a stratified sample of 40 smaller cities ranging in population from 4000 to 299,999, all of which are served by Zipcar.
Researchers observed a significant fall in the price of carsharing suggesting that consumers are reaping benefits from the sector’s evolution and expansion. In addition to being more environmentally sustainable than car ownership, carsharing is increasingly becoming more affordable to lower-income consumers. The decline in rates follows a pattern common among industries that start with an experimental business model and gradually benefit from heightened product awareness, growing managerial sophistication, and greater economies of scale. Tax increases, however, have offset almost a third of the price decline, which may negatively affect operating margins.
More highlights are:

The base rate for a one-hour Zipcar carshare between 2011 and 2016 fell from $9.39 to $8.92, a 5.0% drop. In inflation-adjusted terms, this constitutes an 11.2% real reduction.
Retail taxes over the period rose from 15.5% to 17.0%, offsetting almost one third of the price reduction.
In some cities, taxes on one-hour reservations exceed 30% due to transaction-based fees that apply regardless of the duration of the trip.
Carsharing is becoming more affordable to urban consumers, while being subject to extensive competition and facing the burden of retail taxes that are substantially higher than general sales taxes in most cities.
Although the political economy of car rental taxes makes reform difficult, such efforts should be regarded as being potentially important to the achievement of local sustainability goals.

A new strategy for mobility
This is a summary of the article ” 6 research routes to steer transport policy”, by Erik Bruun and Moshe Givoni, – Nature, 2 July 2015, 29 – 31. Eric Bruun is a visiting professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland. Moshe Givoni is head of the Transport Research Unit, Department of Geography and the Human Environment, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.
Society is not balancing the benefits and costs of mobility. While technology lets us travel faster than ever, many cities are gridlocked and slower than ever – Sao Paolo, Brazil, experiences 8 hour traffic jams. There are 1.2 million traffic deaths every year, over 90 percent occurring in developing countries, half of those to people who don’t even own or ride in cars. Deaths, illness and injury through accidents and air pollution are rising.  In rich countries, sedentary lifestyles and obesity are the direct results of our love affair with the car. In poor countries people may walk to work for two hours to avoid a modest bus fare. Transport research is central to 21st century global challenges including energy provision, climate change and health and a new strategy is needed to balance costs and benefits of mobility. Yet the field is stuck in old ways. The language is changing – ‘transport’ has become ‘mobility’ – and sustainability is often mentioned but remains far from the focus. Planners are still hopelessly trying to fight congestion; researchers promote only technological solutions.
New strategy: the following six priorities for mobility research should inform better transport policies.
1) what are the long term impacts of new technologies?
While the excitement associated with a new product, service or tool is often justified, the negative, unintended impacts should also be anticipated. Take the driverless car. Depending upon whom one asks they will be widespread somewhere between 2025 and 2050.  When framed as a technology that will bring more low-cost mobility that saves time and energy, it is almost impossible to disagree. But it is exactly that thinking that brought us the ‘with-driver’ private car and its unsustainable consequences. The car has become the victim of its own success; and the driverless car promises to be even more successful. Getting us out of the driverless car will be even harder.
2) how should transport systems and their impacts be evaluated?
Monetary cost-benefit analysis is an increasingly controversial method for assessing investment and policy decisions. Transport touches so many aspects of the economic and social life, particularly in urban areas, over such a long time that a financial focus alone cannot do the issue justice. Analysis of multiple criteria offers some improvement but it is unrealistic to capture all impacts in one overall score. Who gains and who suffers needs to be accounted for. An extreme example was the building of freeways through US cities in the 1960s that divided poor communities of colour whilst enabling “white flight” to the suburbs. Another example is how future generations lose out under the current system as the discounting of future costs and benefits encourages consumption of non-renewable resources now.
3) How does the structure of cities affect sustainability, living standards and functioning costs?
Studies of urban density, energy consumption and travel statistics show that altering the form of cities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is equally as effective as improving technologies and substituting fuels, yet it receives much less attention.  Energy consumption per capita by private vehicles declines with higher urban density, for instance. Total expenditures (public and private) on passenger transport also decrease when urban density increases. Yet zoning and infrastructure investment decisions remain unscientific. Understanding the drivers of sprawl is of  vital importance for fast growing cities that are swallowing up adjacent farm and wetlands.
4) how can mobility beyond cities be improved?
Transport links beyond cities are important for regional development. The exodus of people lacking opportunities in the countryside, for example, is driving urbanization worldwide and increasing pressures on scarce resources. While urbanization scholars highlight the rapid growth of megacities, smaller cities and villages will continue to exist and should not be ignored.
5) how should transport be improved in developing countries?
Researchers need to assess and suggest ways to establish rapid, cheap and effective mobility systems in poor nations. Elaborate physical redesigns of the transport system and major investments in infrastructure, similar to those rich countries have made, would take years to implement and are unaffordable. But developing countries can profit from developed countries’ planning mistakes and can ‘leapfrog’ to the latest technologies. Information and communications technologies offer many possibilities. In Nairobi, Kenya, in 2013 student bus passengers were issued with smartphones that allowed city planners and researchers to track their routes, count riders and spot congestion. Many Smartphone apps show promise. For example, one that contacts a traffic signal to let a bus through an intersection could aid mobility flow. Private sector investment in such systems is lacking due to lack of buying power by governments. Public sector funding of such applied research should be encouraged. These make ideal joint projects between universities from countries both rich and poor.
6) What governance works for the transport and mobility system?
Services such as Uber — the taxi smartphone app that connects passengers with drivers in dozens of cities worldwide — and variants of car sharing have caught the transport planning sector by surprise; institutions are not sure whether to support or fight these advances. Like any innovation they are a great opportunity but also carry risks. Even with shared cars, it is physically impossible for large cities to meet everyone’s travel needs with what is essentially a variation of single-occupant vehicles. Research is needed to understand the policy implications of rapid changes in transport technologies and systems and how institutions should evolve to accommodate them. Methodologies and tools are needed for devising effective policies, combining them strategically and overcoming implementation barriers such as public and political acceptability. One method that could be expanded is ‘policy packaging’, where related policies are considered and harmonized in stages.
FRESH THINKING and NEW STRATEGY
New strategy should be based on governments support of system-level research that is needed by the public sector yet attracts scant funding from the private sector. The majority of research money for transport currently goes to technological development with commercial potential — such as the driverless car — which already receives private funding. Universities and governments need to realign research incentives to support the interdisciplinary scholarship needed. This includes stable funding and centres that can attract and nurture a variety of talent and cross-border collaboration, especially where there is lack of commercial potential but great promise to society. If not, researchers will remain in narrow specialities in which funding and publishing are safer. Our transport systems, as well as our cities, must be planned for people — not for a particular mode of transport or by a hand­ful of companies with vast lobbying power. Delivering low-carbon mobility for all will take fresh thinking.

A future of Low Carbon Mobility?
 
This is a summary of the article ” The autonomous car—a blessing or a curse for the future of low carbon mobility? An exploration of likely vs. desirable outcomes”, by Nikolas Thomopoulos and Moshe Givoni, – European Journal of Future Research , December 2015,  3-14.
The Low Carbon challenge: the ‘autonomous car’ ignites the imagination, yet the research and debate on this topic largely focus on the ‘autonomous’ and not adequately on the ‘car’ element. Like any new technological development, autonomous transport presents ample opportunities to better our mobility system, but similarly it carries risks and can lead into a future mobility that exacerbates, rather than relieves, current deficiencies of our mobility systems, including its high carbon and high cost characteristics. Researchers Thomopoulos, from The LSE Cities, London School of Economics and Political Science, and Givoni, from the Transport Research Unit, Department of Geography and the Human Environment, Ten Aviv University, have explored where there is a gap between the likely and desirable outcomes when developing the autonomous car and suggested how it could be reduced.
Moving towards low carbon mobility
Our mobility can be described as high-carbon, where carbon serves as a proxy to a wide range of environmental impacts associated with the way we travel and other negative conditions such as obesity and sedentary lifestyle inherited by our reliance and use of the private car. Low carbon mobility, on the other hand, is defined as mobility that results in substantially lower levels of carbon emissions and can be considered as the ultimate goal for transport policy, planning as well as research. Hardly anyone will argue against the need to move towards low carbon mobility, but there is hardly any agreement on the optimal way to achieve it. Givoni suggesteds three generic pathways to reach low carbon mobility:
Currently the Autonomous Vehicle (AV), and most of the research surrounding it, is probably the most outstanding example of Pathway A, where all efforts are focused on technological developments to decouple mobility from emission of Green House Gases (GHG) and air pollutants. In Pathway B, low carbon mobility is achieved by decoupling economic growth from the demand for transport—largely by focusing on localization and on reducing distances travelled (the global element of society will remain—hence glocalization). Since accessibility may be increased either by increasing velocity (i.e., quicker access to destinations) or proximity (i.e., closer location of destination), it is obvious that corresponding decisions can lead to different outcomes. In the US for example it has been found that solely by doubling urban density within metropolitan regions, vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) can be reduced by up to 25 % if employment locations are also concentrated spatially. Therefore, a new lifestyle approach is advocated in Pathway C, which questions the merit of constantly pursuing economic growth. Focusing instead on improving well-being, which means decoupling wellbeing from economic growth, can act as the means to secure low carbon mobility.

The Low Carbon Mobility (LCM) framework corresponds well with the automobile dependence and ‘peak car’ arguments, which promote a paradigm change in transport planning. The ‘peak car’ theory suggests that “trends in car ownership and use in developed economies […] have passed a turning point and are now in long term decline”. Urbanization and socio-demographics will play a key role in the future determining car use as showcased in developed cities which have reached that level, for example London. Focusing on developed countries with available data, only Finland, Israel and The Netherlands experienced small increases (<1 % annually) in the driving license registrations of young people, whereas all other developed countries experienced decreases. Ageing and the role of young adults at an age eligible to acquire a driving license are key factors influencing synchronous trends in France, Germany, the US and the UK, and will continue to do so in the future. Despite it being unclear why the ‘peak car’ phenomenon is observed in developed countries whilst developing countries are projected to increase their car ownership levels, it is certainly clear that AVs have the potential to revert such trends and reintroduce car use for all age groups irrespectively on whether they own a license or not. How the latter trend is managed in the future could alter car traffic forecasts currently based on the ‘predict and provide’ model and have a substantial impact on car use. In trying to explain ‘peak car’, attention seems to focus on lifestyle and attitudinal factors, and this is likely to be critical in aligning the likely and the desirable outcomes of the development of the AV.
Future Scenarios: car sharing, AV, and Low Carbon Mobility
Various scenarios are possible for the future. The ‘peak car’ phenomenon presents a unique opportunity to shape and influence not only future mobility levels (how much we travel) but also how we travel. Hence it can be said with high certainty that AVs will have a decisive effect on future mobility. Other researchers are saying that: “We must bring together technology, systems design methods and business models to supply better mobility at low cost to consumers and to societies”. This is an attractive proposition with which it is almost impossible to disagree. But it is the exact same thinking that brought the mobility benefits of the ‘with-driver’ private car and the high-carbon mobility with it, the one we now try so hard to move away from. If it is hard to get people out of their cars it can be expected to be harder to get people out of their autonomous cars given the higher number of available options to use travel time for work or leisure. Travel time will then be seen as useful time, namely not wasted time decreasing travel utility. If we will choose to go down the road we now try so hard to escape, the AVs will with high certainty be a curse.
At the same time and as noted previously, AVs offer a unique opportunity to de-privatise car use through sharing. This could have a transformative impact on our mobility. Even more so if sharing will be in the form of more than one individual or groups using the car interchangeably (sharing can take place temporally and spatially). Using AVs to boost car sharing has the potential to reduce environmental impacts. Yet, this is often taken as given not considering at all any unintended consequences, especially overlooking the potentially large rebound effect stemming from overcoming the reality of wasting time while in the car (or, put in other words, the potential to use time more productively while in the car) especially when trying to find a parking space. Given that transport is the sector with the highest growth in terms of energy use and that 96 % of all transport uses fossil fuel, fuel resources and green transport are intertwined. Other researchers describe a continuum that runs from car owning on one hand, through car and bike sharing, to public transport on the other—the ultimate and full sharing mobility service. The AV opens up the opportunity for new ‘green’ autonomous public transport.

Car sharing economy: the introduction of car sharing programs.
Several auto manufacturers have recently introduced car sharing programs. Although the structure of most programs is the same, there is no clear dominant strategy for the type of vehicles that should be provided through car sharing. In this paper, published on the Journal of Manufacturing and Service Operations Management researchers Bellos (School of Business, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia), Ferguson (Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina) and Beril Toktay (Scheller College of Business, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia)  consider an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that contemplates car sharing and designs its product line by accounting for the trade-off between driving performance and fuel efficiency under CAFE standards.
The car sharing economy: customers’ options.
Customers have different valuations of driving performance and decide whether to buy, join car sharing or rely on their outside options. Researchers find that the original equipment manufacturer increases the fuel efficiency of the vehicles it provides through car sharing. This higher efficiency enables the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to charge a higher selling price to the higher end of the market, thus increasing its profit. This is especially beneficial to higher-end original equipment manufacturers that face greater cannibalization and can explain why Daimler and BMW have been particularly active in introducing car sharing. Offering car sharing is not always environmentally beneficial. Even when it is, the researchers find that doing so may reduce the original equipment manufacturers Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) level. In such cases, incentive multipliers should be granted for each shared car. Finally, if anticipating aggressive CAFE standards, original equipment manufacturers may introduce car sharing to better absorb the increase in the production cost.
We believe the paper contributes positively to the big discussion about the important of creating programs aimed at reducing the corporate average fuel economy level.

This is a summary of the article “From Parking lot to Paradise”, by Carlo Ratti and Assaf Biderman – Scientific American 317, 54 – 59 (2017). Carlo Ratti is director of the Senseable City Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and founder of the Carlo Ratti Associati design studio. Assaf Biderman is an inventor, associate director of the Senseable City Lab and founder of Superpedestrian, a company focused on developing robotic vehicles for single and double occupancy.
Cars and Cities have a complicated relationship. Today, plagued with swelling road congestion and rising air pollution, we tend to think of the two as increasingly incompatible. But during the 20th century the automobile left one of the most durable marks on city planning. As Swiss-born architect Le Corbusier declared in his seminal 1925 book The City of Tomorrow and Its Planning, “The motor-car . . . has completely overturned all our old ideas of town planning.” Almost 100 years later we are at a similar turning point. First, demand for urban transportation is expected to more than double by 2050, which means that we will need to more than double capacity on the roads just to keep congestion at the (often unacceptable) levels we experience now. Second, thanks to the rapid convergence of information and communication technologies, robotics and artificial intelligence, our mobility systems—cars, buses and other forms of transportation—are undergoing massive transformations. Once again, they stand poised to radically reshape the urban landscape. Self-driving (or autonomous) vehicles are leading the charge. In recent decades cars have shifted from the kinds of mechanical systems Henry Ford might have recognized to veritable computers on wheels. The average car is now equipped with an array of sensors that collect internal and external data to help it run safely and efficiently. Autonomous cars will free up much of the time we spend every day driving, and they will make our roads safer. They are going to be game changers for our cities but in ways that are far from decided.
The Sharing Economy.
On average, cars sit idle 96 percent of the time. That makes them ideal candidates for the sharing economy. The potential to reduce congestion is enormous. A handful of car-sharing systems are already having a major impact on the total number of vehicles in our cities. Scholars have estimated that every shared vehicle removes nine to 13 privately owned cars from the streets. The benefits will grow exponentially as autonomous vehicles, currently available in experimental forms, gain a notable portion of the market, blurring the distinction between private and public modes of transportation. “Your” car could give you a lift to work in the morning and then, rather than sitting in a parking lot, give a lift to someone else in your family or to anyone else in your neighborhood or social media community. As a result, a single vehicle could go from one to 24 hours of use a day. A recent paper by our colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reports that, under such conditions, the mobility demand of a city like Singapore—host to one of the world’s first publicly accessible fleets of self-driving cars—could be met with only 30 percent of its existing vehicles. In addition to vehicle sharing, autonomy could open up a new wave of ride sharing. Already applications such as Via, uberPOOL and Lyft Line allow different people to share the same ride, cutting operating costs and individual fares. Autonomy could boost ride sharing even more because all trips could be managed online. In cities, the potential for ride sharing is significant, based on analyses by our Senseable City Lab at M.I.T. New York City, for example, is eminently shareable. Our lab’s HubCab project gathered data from 170 million taxi trips involving 13,500 Medallion taxis in the city—specifically, the GPS coordinates for all pickup and drop-off points and corresponding times between the two. We then developed a mathematical model to determine the potential effect of ride sharing applied to those journeys. The project introduced the concept of “share-ability networks,” making it possible to optimize the trip-sharing opportunities. Our quantitative results revealed how taxi sharing could reduce the aggregate number of cars by 40 percent with only minimal delays for passengers. Further work showed that places such as San Francisco, Vienna and Singapore could benefit in similar measure. Combine car sharing and ride sharing, and a city might get by with just 20 percent the number of cars now in use, with its residents traveling on-demand. Of course, such reductions are theoretical. In real life, they would depend on how willing people are to share rides and adopt self-driving technology. But any drop in the number of vehicles could lower the costs and energy associated with building and maintaining our mobility infrastructure. Fewer cars might also mean shorter travel times, less congestion and a smaller environmental impact. It is worth noting that such an enticing vision depends on more than just autonomous cars and smart traffic-management systems. It also requires much better market coordination. Today’s car-sharing companies have independent platforms that do not talk to one another. Customers cannot compare options easily, and drivers cannot benefit from aggregated demand. In cities, two approaches could create a similar mobility architecture. The first would be a bottom-up effort in which small players start adopting standards. This is beginning to happen with a collaboration among Lyft, Didi Chuxing in China, Ola in India and GrabTaxi in Southeast Asia. The second effort would be top down, led by a government or a global organization, such as the World Wide Web Consortium. Because transportation services are already heavily regulated in most countries, this would not be too far-fetched. Either approach could create an incredibly powerful and transparent platform for transportation and logistical services.

South Korea’s second-largest automaker Kia Motors Corp. said on Tuesday that it will launch a car sharing service later this week under the new mobility service brand WiBLE. The automaker’s move comes as part of efforts to ride on the bourgeoning car-sharing business and demand in Korea.
According to Kia Motors, the company’s trial car sharing service will be offered to residents living in the second complex of Cheonwang Yeonji Town in Guro, western Seoul. It will place 9 vehicles including Soul electric vehicle, Niro sport utility vehicle, and Carnival minivan within the complex so that residents can rent them at a low price. All they have to do is download the WiBLE application and reserve a car parked outside in the residential area with just few touches on their smartphones.
The automaker said that it has enhanced auto safety by applying cutting-edge safety features such as front collision alert (FCA), backward collision warning (BCW), and land departure warning (LDW) systems. Kia Motors expects its residential car sharing service will provide a convenient riding experience to residents in need of a second car, especially when they go grocery shopping or drive their children to school.
The automaker plans to expand the car sharing service to other large-scale apartment complexes under the WiBLE brand with an aim to offer a convenient travel experience to consumers.

Kia Motors’ mobility service brand WiBLE, which stands for ¡°widely accessible,¡± was unveiled on Tuesday. The brand includes a meaning that its vehicles are widely accessible anywhere and at any time and provide new experience to consumers in terms of mobility.
Kia Motors move to advance into the new car sharing service industry with WiBLE brand comes as the auto industry has seen a significant leap with the application of cutting-edge information technology (IT) such as self-driving and connected service. Vehicles have become more than simply a means of transportation but a living space. The growing trend for a shared service among consumers has also led to an era where cars are not only owned but shared and rented on demand.
IT companies such as Google Inc., Apple Inc., and Uber Technologies Inc. have also jumped on the bandwagon led by finished car manufacturers and are providing diverse mobility-related services. Hyundai Motor Co. also plans to launch its car sharing service ‘Deal Car’ next month with Hyundai Capital Services Inc.

We had the pleasure to listen the recent intervention by Sandra Phillips at the FIA Conference, Toronto.
Sandra Phillips is the founder of movmi, and is a Shared Mobility Architect who has helped start-ups and Fortune500 organizations since 2010 to create the next generation of shared mobility services.
One of the most important detail of the FIA discussion by Sandra, was the “Bermuda triangle of shared mobility”, or rather, the three areas that define a car-sharing operation: physical space, vehicles, members.

The physical space: includes the road and parking spaces, depending on the shared mobility model. Regardless of the option, the users need to find the vehicle in a physical space and wayfinding is key.
The vehicles: on the one hand they need to be connected to the cloud for members to reserve and unlock it through their app. But apart from connecting the cars to the cloud, they have to be well maintained and serviced. The more efficient your infield management is, the better the experience for your members and the more cost effective for your operations.
The members: they all need access to a vehicle on an occasional basis and want to book one, drive one and move to wherever they need to go. But before they even can drive, they need to register for the program.

Shared mobility systems for bicycles and cars have grown in popularity in recent years and have attracted the attention of the operational research community. Researchers Laporte, from the HEC Montréal, Meunier, from the Université Paris Est, and Calvo, from the Université Paris, have investigated several problems arising at the strategic, tactical and operational levels. Their survey paper classifies the relevant literature under five main headings: station location, fleet dimensioning, station inventory, rebalancing incentives, and vehicle repositioning and open the way to several practical and research questions.
In fact, the world of transportation has witnessed a mini-revolution in June 2007 with the launching of the V ́elib’ bicycle sharing system in Paris. Initially 20,000 bicycles were deployed over 1,500 free-access stations. In the first year 200,000 users registered and 26 million bicycles were rented. Since then, the phenomenon has known a considerable growth. While V ́elib’ was not the first bicycle sharing system, it was the first one of any major significance. Public bicycles were first introduced in Amsterdam in 1965, within the so-called white bicycle plan, but most of these earlier systems ended up in failure because of theft and vandalism. Bicycle sharing really took off with the advent of communication and information technologies which allow for automatic billing and monitoring. Today there are currently over 7,000 bicycle sharing systems in the world, involving over 800,000 bicycles.
In parallel, a number of car sharing systems have also been put in place. Again, the first one (Autolib’) was set up in Paris in 2007. Currently the world’s largest car sharing networks totally mora than 2 million of users and almost 25.000 vehicles in several Navigant Consulting predicts that the number of car sharing members will grow over 12 million worldwide by 2020 and will generate in excess of US$ 6 billion in revenue. The growth and expansion of car sharing systems will be fueled by high energy costs, limited and expensive parking, improved technologies and increased demand for personal vehicle access in developing countries.
The central problem faced by shared mobility systems operators is to maintain an adequate number of vehicles in every station. Indeed, too large a number can impede the return of vehicles whereas too small a number may translate into lost demand. Locating stations, choosing the number of vehicles per station, moving vehicles between stations, inciting users to change their destination, are all managerial decisions guided by the need to provide a good quality of service, at both end-stations. Providing effective tools to support these decisions constitutes an important motivation for researchers in this new field, especially for operational researchers. However, shared mobility systems have also attracted the attention of researchers in other areas, such as transport economics, urban planning, sociology, and data mining. Data mining actually plays an important role in determining the values of the parameters in most of the operational research models. The purpose of the researchers was to survey the main operational research issues arising in shared mobility systems as well as the methods that have been proposed to address them. They examined station location, fleet dimensioning, station sizing, rebalancing incentives, and vehicle repositioning. For each of these topics, they provided an overview on the literature and describe one or more solution approaches that seemed important to them.
According to the researchers, some interesting combinatorial questions remain to be investigated. For example, determining the optimal inventory level at each station is an important aspect of the rebalancing problem that has not yet received much attention and should ideally be studied within a theoretical framework. On the methodological side, the design of exact algorithms for the multi-truck rebalancing problem has not yet been investigated and seems rather difficult for instances of reasonable sizes.

Autonomous Mobility has been making increasing inroads across many domains globally. In such a scenario, the traditional fear has been that automation will take away human jobs. But as empirical evidence demonstrated after the Industrial Revolution, while some job categories became redundant, the emergence of technology triggered job creation in other spheres.
Job-loss fears arose when banks were computerising services in India during the late 1980s. Bank unions then struck work. A decade later, it was clear computerisation did not make jobs redundant but actually facilitated faster work for bank employees!
Today, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics has been stoking similar fears of job losses and redundancy globally. The feeling of déjà vu is but natural. There is no doubt, however, that automation boosts productivity. Thereby, employees achieve more in fewer hours with less effort compared to doing the same work manually. Therefore, it’s time people realise that automation increases better safety, general comfort and productivity rather than the other way around. Besides time, money and resources are also saved.
Consider self-driving vehicles. Uber, Tesla, Google, Amazon and Apple, among others, are all working frenetically in ensuring their self-driving vehicles makes it to the market first. Few On-Demand ride hailing companies has started performing live testing on the roads of Pittsburgh and Singapore for a self-driving taxis – which promises a great future by merging two of the most promising mega trends in mobility- Shared Mobility and Autonomous Driving
Select companies in India are also making efforts to introduce technology for contributing towards self-driving vehicles ecosystems. But some analysts are sceptical that India is ready to allow self-driving vehicles on its streets anytime soon. Moreover, in certain quarters the misconception about automation driving job losses is becoming a regular refrain. Yet, India can definitely be ready to welcome autonomous mobility in general and self-driving vehicles in particular, since the NDA Government has been working on all fronts to promote infrastructure development and modernisation.
Indeed, there’s an inexorable trend towards automation worldwide. As per industry estimates, ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) and Industrial Logistics Robotics will comprise a $185 billion market by 2025, rising from $39 billion in 2017. This indicates a CAGR of 21%+. Here, the role of AI is unmistakeable. Benefits include increasing asset utilisation, preserving natural resources, reducing risks, improving efficiencies in time and cost and decreasing pollution levels overall.
For autonomous vehicles in India, good roads and other infrastructure are imperative to make this dream a reality. But other imperatives exist for autonomous vehicles and complete automation in general. Two core prerequisites are driving attitude and habits.
To hasten the pace of automation in automotive and other domains, it’s necessary to realise job losses are not a given as the above examples clarify. Even if job losses occur, these are compensated by employment opportunities elsewhere. As in the case of bank employees, once workers in diverse sectors realise automation can actually benefit them, they would be receptive towards technology in their industries.
The Indian driving conditions are the most challenging ones given there are huge number of edge cases and hence solving a problem here makes it ready for anywhere in the global. Training neural networks for predicting these notorious habits of Indian drivers, who are prone to breaking road safety rules rather than following them is a huge challenge. Drivers in India are known to cut across lanes randomly and break red lights at will. Additionally, trespassers of all kinds could suddenly appear on a supposedly-clear road. After autonomous cars are programmed about unusual behaviour, self-driving vehicles will automatically regulate their speeds even on ‘empty’ roads.
Simultaneously, drivers and pedestrians would need to be educated about autonomous cars and forewarned about avoiding risky road habits practised hitherto before human drivers.
Once current barriers such as lack of infrastructure, bad habits and wrong attitudes are addressed, there is every reason to believe India will be more than ready for self-driving cars and automation across industries.

In this article, originally published on qwekee.com, Nerio Celkonas, founder of qwekee, analyze the profitability of car sharing.
Many are asking me whether car sharing is a lucrative business, and whether it is profitable. After all, automotive industry is about to change in the recent years. It’s starting to irritate us because it takes us out of the comfort zone. This is understandable, nobody likes changes. But let’s not be Nokia, Blackberry or Kodak, and at least try to calculate.
I will briefly remind you that the automotive industry is rapidly evolving in two different directions at the same time – because trends simply tear it apart in different directions, but there is no other way.
One direction is the use of excessive resources or increase of efficiency.

Cars are sold at their full value but only used 5% of the time. Therefore, there are only two logical outcomes.
1.     Car manufacturers offer the on-demand service, i.e. to pay only for 5% – only as much as you use. If you notice, this is already happening (all TOP10 brands have already invested in sharing or rental platforms).
2.     Car owners come together to sharing platforms and groups (collective collaboration) and monetize surplus resources. This is already happening (Getaround, Drivy, Turo).
_____________________________________________________________________
The second direction is the introduction and development of new technologies. This is cost reduction.
1.     Electric cars and infrastructure (10 times cheaper than petrol).
2.     Self-driving or autonomous cars (robocars) (2 times cheaper because there is no need for a driver).
_____________________________________________________________________
As a complete picture, we should see self-driving robocars in the streets in 2020. Thus, the business model is changing today, and for all players. Car rentals, OEM‘s, fuel companies, individual owners, taxis, professional drivers etc.
So if you agree with me that this is not my imagination for 2090, and if you already notice some kind of signs around yourself, it is time to take a calculator and count.
I used the euro currency since it is the midway between the dollar and the pound, and it helps to easily understand the essence without burdening you with too much mathematics.
Car sharing: at first, let’s have some statistics from our experience and customers.
1.     In a city with a population of 500 thousand, 100 sharing cars generate about 1,000 orders per day (it is on the second year of operation, but with changing use, the number is reached more quickly every year), i.e., each car is used on average 10 times by different people every day. When making a business plan, do not forget that these are 18-40-year-old smartphone holders.
2.     On average, one trip takes 20 minutes and its length is an average of 18 km. It is when we determine the price not for a minute but per kilometre, people tend to drive faster ;). It means that one car is used for about 3 hours per day. With growing popularity of the service, this number will only grow.
3.     The average selling price of one-minute is about 0.30 cents (plus the cost of extra minutes without additional service) making it difficult to calculate the number of kilometres per minute, in addition, different distances, and different time affects income. It is safer to set the price per 1 km but then you lose the potential synergies. But I will tell you statistically that the average selling price of 1 km is 0.45 ct (all-inclusive: fuel, insurance, consumables etc., without driver – because you drive yourself).
4.     Thus, the average daily income is 10 trips, 18 km each, per 0.45 ct and we have 81 euro/day. When the car is used only for 3 hours or 20% of the potential time (15 h out of 24 h) still 80% space is left to grow.
So we have income – about 80 euro per day.
Costs are calculated roughly because sometimes they increase regardless of our intentions, and sometimes the “invisible hand” helps us. We assume that the car will serve for 60 months (5 years) and will drive 4,500 km per month (180 km per day for 25 days) or 270,000 during its entire lifetime. Of course, car rental cars are on average used only for 1.5 years but their residual value is higher.
1.     Car depreciation – 12,000 euro minus the residual value of 3,000, and we have 9,000/60 months = 150 euro per month, or 0.03 cents/km or 6 euro per day.
2.     Fuel 1 euro excl. VAT in litres (these are the basic costs, so be careful), the prices range from 0.5 cents/litres USD or 1 euro in Europe excl. taxes, but are different in each country. Divide the electric car energy costs by 10. We assume that the compact car fuel rate in the city is 7 l/100 km. Thus, 180 km/day uses 13 litres or 13 euro per day
3.     Consumables, accidents, insurance, repair etc. is max 2,400 euro per year, or 11 euro per day.
Thus, the cost is 27 euro per day.
Gross daily income is 53 euro per day/car or 1,325 euro per month (25 days) or 79,500 euro in 60 months. If you buy a 15,000 euro car, net profit you can calculate easily.
Now look at your car rental average income or look to you idle parked car and think twice.
The essential thing here is the income per day, for all 25 days, excluding seasons, because unlike in the case of car rental the customers are not tourists but locals and, therefore, not subject to seasonality.
Gross daily income is 53 euro per day/car or 1,325 euro per month (25 days) or 79,500 euro in 60 months. 
If the car is used only for 20 months and drives 90,000 km, the “consumed value” will be lower but 1 km property depreciation cost will change insignificantly. Of course, that “insignificantly” can quickly become very “significant” when you have a fleet of 100 thousand. But these calculations are for beginners to understand the car sharing business economy.
Therefore, business trends are quite clear, electro cars, free floating models in the cities reaching the maximum number of hours per day.
By the way, the same calculation applies for P2P car sharing or collaborative consumption supporters, only the car depreciation price will be lower because of less expensive cars but more expensive operation. Although people usually do not engage in such bookkeeping, which leads to Uber’s business model, when you simply enjoy the daily income because you just need to cover your daily expenses.

It could soon be easier for residents who want to go without a car to get around the city.
The city of Charlotte is planning to launch a two-year car-share pilot program this summer with Boston-based Zipcar.
The pilot program will include 12 designated Zipcar spaces in uptown and South End. The city will provide six on-street spaces, and Zipcar will provide six others off-street.
The pilot program will operate at no cost to the city.

Car-sharing services are becoming more popular these days, with active operations in more than 400 North American cities, according to a city of Charlotte presentation.
Unlike traditional car rental companies, Zipcar lets users take out a car by the hour, making it easier for people to go without a car. It’s also quicker to rent the car on short-term notice.
Through the Zipcar service, potential users go through five steps: create a Zipcar account, reserve a car, unlock it with an issued Zipcard or with the app, drive and return the car to its original spot.
The cost for the average user is approximately $12 an hour plus an annual membership fee. It is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for registered students 18 and up, and for non-students 21 and up. Users have to be pre-approved.
The user is allocated 180 miles of driving a day. The hourly fees pay for gas as well as insurance.
Zipcar provides its service to more than one million members, with over 12,000 vehicles in more than 500 cities and towns worldwide.
The company was founded in 2000 and was bought by Avis Budget Group in 2013 for $500 million.
The founders of Zipcar were inspired by car sharing already in place in Europe. A future where car-sharing members outnumber car owners in major cities is the organization’s ultimate goal.
Studies show, in services implemented in Minneapolis, that car sharing reduces personal vehicle use and increases public transit use as well as walking and biking, according to the city presentation.
A study conducted by the Transportation Research Board and the National Academy of Sciences found that the implementation of one shared car removes approximately 13 cars from the road.
Zipcar already has a small presence in Charlotte with one spot at Element Uptown apartments, one spot at UNC Charlotte and with service at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport. The company also recently launched at Davidson College as well.

During the last few years, carsharing has undergone significant growth, both in Canada and around the world. In this type of service, users share access to a fleet of vehicles, thereby giving them most of the advantages of automobile use, such as its temporal and spatial flexibility, without many of the constraints of ownership. This study analyzes the geographical and socio-economic factors that favour membership of a carsharing service in Québec City. We combined Cervero’s and Kockelman’s 5D model (density, diversity, design, distance to transit, and destination accessibility) with Hägerstrand’s concept of innovation diffusion so as to analyze the evolution of potential car-sharing membership. Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression was used to model the spatial diffusion of the number of car-sharing members in Québec City from 1996 (two years after its inauguration) to 2008 at the local scale, with an annual time step. Results indicate that the carsharing distribution did, indeed, follow Hägerstrand’s innovation diffusion model and that, even though some of the 5D model significantly influenced membership, it was socio-economic factors (education, non-motorization, and family structure) that most greatly affected the membership rate in the service area. The model is used to assess and discuss market coverage potential in Québec City.
Results indicated that carsharing diffusion in Québec City was in keeping with Hägerstrand’s (1967) innovation diffusion model and that, even though urban factors significantly influenced carsharing membership, it was socio-economic factors (education, non-motorization, and family structure) that had the greatest effect on membership in the service area. Moreover, the results provided answers to the following questions:

(1) What is the diffusion potential of this emergent phenomenon?

Carsharing in Québec City, a highly motorized urban area where the automobile’s modal share plainly dominates (74.7% of traveling in the city in 2006), clearly shows that this niche market responded very well to the needs of certain population segments and that there was potential to extend into suburbs insofar as the latter had the necessary public transportation services and good pedestrian accessibility. The results presented in this study make it possible to foresee the likely extension of the service area based on previous development phases (the “inflated” part of the model). This is one of the original features of our work.

(2) Is carsharing development highly dependent on the urban form, restricting diffusion to higher density neighbourhoods with good accessibility to services and workplaces?

The membership potential depended above all on socio-economic factors such as motorization rate (negative effect), mix of transportation modes based on needs (positive), the presence of children (positive), especially in single-parent families (positive), level of education (positive), and income (negative). These results temper observations made by Burkhart and Millard-Ball (2006) about household size (predominance of single persons). Nonetheless, some of the urban form factors were also pertinent. Design, public transportation (distance to transit), and good accessibility to workplaces and stores were conditions that were just as necessary and that could partially compensate for a low residential density. Of all the factors tested, bus accessibility provided the best potential for development, which confirms the complementary nature of carsharing and public transportation. This confirms and tempers the conclusion of Stillwater et al. (2009), by showing that the mean densities of some neighbourhoods likewise entail good potential when certain socioeconomic and environmental factors are brought together.

(3) Since access to car pools implies walking (or riding) to fixed-location parking lots, should we expect a sort of “oil stain” diffusion process on membership because cars are allocated on a proportional basis (e.g. 1 car per 20 members around a pool)?

The main form of growth has been to spread like an oil stain, even though the spatial-temporal diffusion model also had a piggy-back growth pattern, which made it possible to get around nearby obstacles. In Québec City, the main obstacles are the St. Lawrence River, industrial parks, institutional grounds (e.g., the campus of Laval University), and expressways. In our experience, the diffusion radius was at least two kilometres, which could be verified in a few years when the service has spread even more in Québec City, or in Montréal where the service will soon have been there long enough to apply the same model with more members in a bigger surface area.

SOUTHOLD, NY — With the North Fork continuing to emerge as a tourist destination, Southold Town is seeking alternatives to help solve traffic congestion issues and help visitors and residents traverse area roadways more easily. To that end, at Tuesday’s work session, the board discussed two proposals, one, for a ride sharing program (rideshare), and the second, for a Suffolk County regional bike sharing program (bikeshare). Paul Spreer, regional project manager of 511NY Rideshare, conducted a presentation on a ridesharing portal now available on the Southold Town website.
“Once you register you’ll have access to thousands of other users as well. From carpooling and vanpooling to transit and bicycling, no matter where you live, there are alternatives to driving alone. Ridesharing can be a convenient, money saving travel experience. Check out all that we have to offer — ridematching for carpools, resources and information for transit, park and ride, bicycling, walking, and other options,” the site reads.
Spreer, regional project manager of 511NY Rideshare, said the goal of the program, run in conjunction with the New York State Department of Education, is to work with municipalities to reduce single occupancy vehicles around Long Island, something that’s beneficial from an economic and environmental standpoint, with an eye toward improving air quality in the area.
The website, he said, serves as a central location to inform both residents and visitors about their transportation options in town. Those who log in can find quick ride matches to meet their needs, he said. “It’s kind of like a match.com for car poolers,” Spreer said.
Those who sign up can log on and find someone to ride with, making plans to meet and commute together. The MTA is looking for options for SUV lanes, with an eye toward getting more than two people into a car to head to the city or another destination, he said. Success has already been found with larger organizations including hospitals, he said. The entire program is free of charge, Spreer said. “We all live on Long Island and we all know how important having a car is,” Spreer said. “We’re not putting anyone’s feet to the fire,” but anything that can lessen traffic on the roads is a plus, he said. Those who sign up online can fill out a profile including their “likes” for a commute, including whether or not they like loud music or coffee on the drive. The website also features local bus routes. “It’s kind of a one stop shop for people to find out what they need,” he said.
The riideshare might be particularly useful for various North Fork events such as the Strawberry Festival or for visiting popular businesses such as the lavender farm, Spreer said.
He added that a trolley coming to the North Fork is important to embrace from a strategic standpoint. “Under the heading of Captain Obvious, for every full trolley, that takes potentially 40 cars off the road,” he said. And, he added, as of June 29, Suffolk County residents will be able to utilize Uber and Lyft, which can be used to transport individuals as a “last mile solution,” perhaps picking up groups at designated exits on the highway with large vehicles that can be shared by 6 to 8 passengers. Spreer said the town should speak to local merchants and Chambers of Commerce to share the information about the new service; ridesharing is only as strong as the data it offers on the website, he said. Already, the company is working with the Huntington and Patchogue Chambers, he said.
In addition to rideshare, Spreer said the company has been working with Patchogue Village on a parking shuttle program, bringing visitors and up to 500 employees on a busy night to the popular and bustling Main Street. Issues such as gas money and liability would be dealt with by the town, Spreer said. Southold Town Supervisor Scott Russell said a joint meeting with local Chambers of Commerce would be organized to see if they have “buy in” for their own sites.
Not only rideshare: Bike sharing options
Next, Nick Palumbo, executive director of sustainability for Suffolk County Community College, discussed a Suffolk County regional bike share program with the board. “Bike sharing is really growing worldwide,” he said, adding that there are more than 850 systems internationally, and that he’s been working on the idea of a regional bikeshare program across Long Island for six months. One of the reasons the idea has become more popular is because of smart phone technology, he said. Benefits include getting people out of their cars and more active, a boon for public health, stress reduction and weight loss. He said those who are worried about impacts on local bike shops needn’t be; those shops benefit from the program and have even become involved with regional bike sharing. So far, the only bikeshare program on Long Island is in Long Beach; there are others in Albany and Buffalo, Palumbo said. The cost of the system varies depending upon the size of the program, he said. The hope is that Suffolk County would serve as a lead agency, with an umbrella contract that would allow local municipalities to opt in, he said. The county will be issuing a request for proposals for a bikeshare company in the coming weeks, he said. “The region has not been bike friendly but we see that starting to change, and we think a regional bikesharing program would facilitate that change,” Palumbo said. For example, he said, a dedicated bike path has been installed on Route 347, and a new rails to river program just opened in Port Jefferson; a dedicated bike lane could be coming soon to Nichols Road, Palumbo said. The goal is a commuter connection, that would let people use trains and then bike the last mile to hamlet centers, public libraries and other locales. The bikes would also be a good idea in areas where tourism is seasonal, he said. Bikes could be sited at existing bike trails, beaches, schools, health care facilities and train stations, Palumbo said. At Suffolk County Community College’s three campuses, of the 28,000 students, approximately 6,000 don’t have vehicles and rely on other forms of transportation; bikesharing allows them the possibility to rely upon public transportation and not have to own a car, Palumbo said. “We see the county’s role as being important in this effort,” Palumbo said. He added that Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone has shown support for the initiative. The idea could work in Nassau County, too, he said. Palumbo said he’s also presented the plan to the Riverhead and Southampton town boards, as well as various villages, and will soon speak to East Hampton.
Costs of bikesharing
Startup capital for the program is estimated at a cost of $1,600 per bike, which includes technology built in to the bikes, and collection points where bikes will be collected estimated to cost another $450. Funding sources include sponsorships, rider use fees and memberships, and grants, Palumbo said. In Portland, Nike sponsors a successful bike sharing program, he said. Local sponsors could also be sought in Southold, he said. “We think the time is right for Long Island to get on board with this,” Palumbo said. Russell asked about the specifics of the program, such as where sites would be located. Palumbo said a contract would be awarded by the county and towns would have the ability to opt in; town officials would work with vendors in the planning effort to identify locations that would be suitable for bikesharing. It’s up to the vendor to rebalance the system, bringing bikes to a docking site that has none; incentives could be provided to encourage individuals to retrieve a bike and bring it back to the train station, for example, Palumbo said. Councilman Jim Dinizio said most of the town’s train stations are not located near main hamlet hubs and said many roads are not wide enough for bike lanes; he asked how the program would work in that situation. While Long Island doesn’t have many biking trails to date, Palumbo said the new program could create change. “We see this as an opportunity to address that. When you provide bikes, you provide the rationale for creating biking infrastructure. It’s not chicken and egg. We want to do both things simultaneously. Hopefully, having a system across Long Island will make it more viable,” he said.

Mark Fields was replaced as chief executive of Ford by Jim Hackett towards the end of May and if the Michigan-based carmaker is to be believed, this was down to needing to drive forward more decisively with electric vehicles, hybrids and new mobility as a service (MaaS) solutions, such as car-sharing and ride-hailing.

MaaS is a shift away from personally owned modes of transportation and works by combining transport from public and private providers in a unified way to create and manage a trip, which users can pay for with a single account. Users can pay per trip or a monthly fee for a limited distance.
The idea may initially prompt disbelief, but with the rise of PCP acting as an indicator of how unimportant UK consumers find the  traditional concept of ownership, is MaaS really so radical?
An April 2017 online survey of 400 UK and US drivers by Nuance, a US-based voice control technology company, found that 25% would sign up to MaaS. Autonomous vehicles of the future will go hand-in-hand with this type of future transport.

More than half (52%) of respondents said they would still like to own their autonomous vehicle, but may use MaaS, while 14% would like to use an autonomous car through MaaS for most trips, but would still like to own one and use it every now and then.
Before he took over, Hackett was already leading Ford Smart Mobility, a subsidiary formed to design, build, grow and invest in mobility services. Now he is tasked with pushing the Blue Oval as a whole to target alternative ownership solutions and connected motoring innovations.
Ford will open a ‘Smart Mobility Innovation Office’ in London this summer with space for 40 staff.
Steve Hood, chairman and chief executive at Ford-owned retail group TrustFord, has already said dealers are going to have to be “very-open minded” towards car-sharing and pay-to-use business models.
He said: “Customers’ needs and expectations are starting to change. Sooner or later, things are going to change significantly.”
“By the time MaaS takes off in a big way… the market would have to move away from margin schemes and towards a fixed-price-per-model basis” Nigel McMinn, Lookers
Nigel McMinn, Lookers’ managing director, acknowledged it is difficult to say how quickly MaaS will grow, but believes the pace of change in the automotive business model is slow compared with fast moving markets such as digital technology.
McMinn said: “I’m confident we will see the market shifting from a mile off. It’s very rare in automotive to get a CD-to-iTunes or an iTunes-to-Spotify-type switch.
“It took 10 years for PCP to really establish itself. If you look at mobility schemes, they are a fraction of the market. Personal leasing is a step on the road.
“There is nothing to suggest right now that MaaS will be at 2% or even 4% in a year or two. I think it’s going to take another 20 years before we see some real change in the way the model is in the UK.”
Mark Lavery, the chief executive of Cambria Automobiles, does not dismiss MaaS as a potential outcome for the future in the UK, but thinks customers still want to have their own car in the medium term.
He said: “I know companies like Zipcar are disrupting the market and I’m sure MaaS will play a part in the future.
“But if you’re looking at the UK public, specifically outside of major urban locations, I think it’s going to take a very long time to move away from the outright vehicle ownership model.
“Outside of major urban locations, I think it’s going to take a very long time to move away from the outright vehicle ownership model” Mark Lavery, Cambria
“That need to own a vehicle is even more pronounced, I think, when you look at the premium market or for vehicles that fall outside a logical purchasing decision and into the emotional category.”
McMinn said even if his views on how quickly the market will grow are wrong, MaaS will have to compete with PCPs on price to be a success.
He said: “The logical option would mean you would have to offer a subscription model on a much cheaper basis than a PCP. If you look at the monthly cost of an average PCP at £200 a month, that’s £6.45 a day. If you look at something like a Skoda Citigo, which would probably be the sort of A to B motoring model you would go for, it’s around £100 a month, that’s £3.22 a day.
“I’m really struggling to understand how someone can come to the market and offer a solution at a lower entry price than that.”
McMinn said dealers will adapt to changes in the market and MaaS will be one part of a range of offers available to customers.
He said: “When the market does grow, dealers will play a part in supplying and servicing them,  a bit like a fleet deal.
“I think by the time MaaS takes off in a big way, the entire dealer remuneration model would have changed. My speculative prediction is the market would have to move away from margin schemes and towards a fixed-price-per-model basis.”
Lavery is also confident there will be opportunities, as long as businesses are willing to adapt.
He said: “I think autonomous vehicles will add a huge amount of value in metro areas specifically, and dealers have to be a part of that.
“I can imagine city centres with connected traffic and an ‘eye in the sky’-style situation. There could very well be a subscription-style service for autonomous vehicles.
“But as long as there is a need for servicing and supply of those vehicles, there will still be a need for dealers.”
 
Shared ownership in action
Nissan has already launched its Get & Go Micra business in Paris. The digital platform will allow users to meet via social networking, with a profile-matching service to find an ideal car-sharing partner.
The service lets customers part-own a brand new Nissan Micra between two and five people for a year, with insurance and servicing thrown in as part of the package.
Those involved in the scheme agree to an annual mileage limit of 9,320 miles. Sharing the car is managed through a dedicated app, which shows where the car is, allows keyless opening, management of use, booking times and a messaging service for owners.
Carlos Ghosn, Nissan and Renault chairman and chief executive, said: “We are moving toward a future where car usage may be more flexible, social and shared.
“At Nissan, we are pioneering new ways to allow drivers to enjoy the freedom and financial benefits of shared car ownership.”
While the concept is being trialled on a Micra, a low-cost model, it’s easy to imagine the cost of an automated vehicle, which may be expensive before mass market adoption, being more accessible if the price is split between five.
From the dealer’s perspective that potentially takes five buyers out of the market, but in areas such as central London, those five people were unlikely to have bought a car anyway.
Lynk & Co, a new challenger brand from China (it is owned by manufacturer Geely), is launching in the UK with a disruptive ownership model in less than two years’ time.
Its business model is based on three concepts, the first of which is common among Asian car manufacturers – all vehicles will be loaded with kit and the price will compete with volume players. This includes a lifetime’s free connectivity with 4G Wi-Fi and a guaranteed warranty.
The second concept is that all customers will be able to share ownership of the car with their local community. Access to the car will be possible via voice recognition.
The third is that buying, ‘subscribing’ and maintaining the 01 SUV, which  was revealed at the Shanghai Motor Show earlier this year, will be done directly with Lynk. It will be predominantly a digital interaction, with no franchised dealer network partner. However, it is likely to use high-footfall retail locations, echoing companies such as Tesla and Rockar.
A spokesman for Lynk & Co said: “We will be offering new solutions for car usage and access is to be offered to customers. This will range from traditional ownership and leasing to subscription and sharing-membership.”
Lynk is working with Microsoft and Alibaba (the Chinese equivalent of  eBay) to build its digital customer infrastructure with new order, supply, sales and CRM systems.
It also has a partnership with Ericsson to create its vehicles’ car connectivity cloud. Lynk wouldn’t comment on whether it was looking to partner with eBay or Amazon for the UK market, although Amazon is expected to launch a UK car sales trial in 2018 and is already recruiting car sales executives, according to reports.
The ‘Lynk & Co community’ will be able to control ownership of the vehicle with an app. The car can then be shared through the Ericsson digital platform, based upon a member’s service requirements.
The spokesman said: “If you as a customer should want to share your car, you can. If you don’t, then members don’t have to.
“We have conducted very detailed private market research which has led us down this route.
“It is clear that the ways of purchasing and outright owning a car have changed dramatically over the previous 10 years.”

The number of electric cars on the roads around the world rose to 2 million in 2016, following a year of strong growth in 2015, according to the latest edition of the International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook.
The report highlights that cities are taking leadership roles in encouraging electric vehicle (EV) adoption, often because of concerns about air quality, and that major urban centres usually achieve higher EV market shares compared to national averages. A third of global EV sales took place in 14 cities in 2015.
“Cities have a unique role to play in supporting the deployment of charging infrastructure in a way that best adapts to the characteristics of the urban mobility and geography of each city,” Marine Gorner, co-author of the Global EV Outlook 2017, told Cities Today. “Cities are also in the best position to attract and implement innovation, run pilot tests leading to improvements before scale up. More importantly, the urban space offers a lot of advantages for testing and promoting synergies between innovations in different sectors, for example shared mobility and electrification.”
Paris, for instance, has mandated that any electric car is allowed to re-charge at the stations of its car-sharing programme, Autolib. Amsterdam has a unique strategy of offering the installation of charging points on public parking spaces to people who make a request, ensuring that charging infrastructure is installed where it’s actually needed. London for its part encourages EV adoption by waiving its congestion charge.
Four major US cities–Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco and Portland–are leading a partnership of over 30 cities to mass-purchase EVs for their public fleets including police cruisers, street sweepers and trash haulers. The group is currently seeking to purchase over 110,000 EVs, a significant number when compared to the 160,000 total EVs sold in the United States in 2016.
“Cities can complement government support provided in the form of standards, taxation and financial incentive, with measures adapted to the local context and that further enhance the value-proposition of driving electric,” added Gorner. “These measures usually take the form of waivers on access restrictions or congestion charging, access to bus lanes, free/dedicating parking, and can be designed by municipalities in accordance with their own very specific features of geography, density and mobility patterns.”
The electric car market is set to transition from early deployment to mass market adoption over the next decade or so. Between 9 and 20 million electric cars could be deployed by 2020, and between 40 and 70 million by 2025, according to estimates based on recent statements from carmakers.
Still, electric vehicles only made up 0.2 percent of total passenger light-duty vehicles in circulation in 2016. They have a long way to go before reaching numbers capable of making a significant contribution to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. In order to limit temperature increases to below 2°C by the end of the century, the number of electric cars will need to reach 600 million by 2040, according to IEA’s Energy Technology Perspectives.
“To meet GHG emission mitigation goals, the electrification of mobility needs to go hand-in hand with the deep decarbonisation of electricity supply,” said Gorner. “This transition takes place on top of other major changes taking place at lower costs, including the increased reliance on public transport modes and the development of urban environments allowing the reduction of trip distances in metropolitan areas.”

The Mobility Paradox.
Here’s the reality: People keep moving to cities because they offer a wealth of cultural and entertainment options, places to eat, and a variety of ways to connect with others. It’s no surprise people want to move to places that provide fun and exciting things to do.
Half the world’s population lives in cities, a number we believe will top 60 percent in the coming decades. The increasing population means urban areas are struggling with transportation and infrastructure challenges to manage the sheer number of individuals needing to get around every day.
Moreover, when people move to a city, they bring an ecosystem that supports and supplies their needs, including delivery services.
But people moving into cities is not the problem. Despite increasing populations, cities aren’t becoming larger, nor are they necessarily adding roads.
Because the amount of space a city has is finite, adding an influx of single-occupancy cars to an already congested landscape creates more gridlock and frustration, and thus a greater need for transportation alternatives.
Last September, Ford created a City Solutions team to help analyze and solve urban transportation problems. Since then, we have been listening and talking to cities to identify potential solutions that fit into an existing transit infrastructure to move people around more efficiently and comfortably.
Our team is working to accommodate urban development by making cities healthier and improving productivity.
We’re working with cities around the world, listening to the specific issues they face. We’re committed to delivering solutions that make sense for everybody, and part of that includes Chariot — the shuttle service we’re launching in Seattle.
Seattle marks the third market for Chariot. We’re launching there with its enterprise commuter shuttle service, which serves companies wanting to provide transportation solutions to their employees — from last-mile service, to and from Park & Rides and transit hubs, to providing direct service to and from underserved neighborhoods.
The mobility paradox: it’s vital employers and city government work together to start the conversation on transportation options, and our City Solutions team is engaging with companies to facilitate those conversations.
Workers live and play in the city, and as companies increasingly commit to shrinking their commuter footprint, their input is key to making shared commutes more attractive. While some companies already provide a mobility benefit, we see this as a perk to be widely encouraged.
In Seattle, residents have chosen to move away from the solo commute, with ridership on King County’s Metro system growing. In 2016, the system ferried passengers on a record 122 million trips.
Meanwhile, all transit agencies in the county serviced 163 million trips, marking a 17 percent increase since 2010. Despite the transit gains, Seattle is home to the 10th-worst traffic in the country, with residents stuck on the road for nearly 55 hours a year.
Chariot will offer Seattle residents an additional option for commuting to work. Its shuttles can hold significantly more commuters than a typical single-passenger vehicle, with the same physical and carbon footprint, and it’s a fast, reliable and affordable transportation alternative.
Going forward, we’d like to see Chariot become available to a larger population of commuters.
Public transit continues to have an important role in the urban commuting environment.
We see shuttles as a meaningful way of easing the burden on a transportation infrastructure that’s challenged by increased ridership. Shuttle services can help ensure smooth operation of the entire system.
The mobility paradox – the goal of transit is simple: to move people from point A to point B.
Ford is looking to collaborate with local government, transit authorities and other experts to figure out the best way to do that — whether it means operating independently, coordinating directly with public transit or working with companies to offer alternatives.
From ride hailing and ride sharing to increased ridership on subways and buses, we know people want mobility alternatives.
The mobility paradox: at Ford, we see our job as helping to make that happen, while developing a transportation ecosystem that’s as healthy and efficient as possible. It’s important to help make our cities as vibrant and livable as possible as they grow.

Disruptive technologies

(by Paulo Humanes)


 
There is one thing that almost all cities around the world have in common: their streets are congested with cars, causing traffic jams and accidents, polluting the air and taking up an immense amount of the highly contested urban space. More and more local authorities try to tackle the problem by setting up restrictions and banning cars from the city centres.
However, addressing the symptoms alone is no solution; we also have to face up the underlying cause, which is the conventional use of conventional cars. And therefore we need mobility disruptive technologies.
Follow me back to the late 1800s and I will explain why. Horses everywhere: the Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894 was as challenging then as cars are now. Nineteenth-century cities heavily depended on horses for their daily functioning. On the streets of London there were 11,000 carriages and several thousand horse-drawn buses making a total of over 50,000 horses transporting people around the city every day.
All these horses produced huge amounts of manure. Between 15 and 35 pounds per day and animal were littered on the streets, attracting large numbers of flies. Other big cities, such as New York or Paris, faced the same problem with each having around 100,000 horses producing several million pounds of manure every day.
This problem came to a head in 1894 – later known as the ‘Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894’ – when The Times newspaper predicted: ‘In 50 years, every street in London will be buried under nine feet of manure.’ Consequently, horses and their manure were the main topic in 1898 at the world’s first international urban planning conference held in New York, but no solution could be found.
However, as it is said, necessity is the mother of invention, and the invention in this case was that of the car. With Henry Ford coming up with the idea of an assembly line and mass-producing affordable cars, the decline of the horse was only a matter of time. By 1912, this seemingly insurmountable problem had disappeared.
The full benefits of automation will come later on when the infrastructure adapts to the technology of autonomous vehicles
The ‘car crisis of 2016’
‘Well, that was an interesting story, but how is this going to help us ‘free’ the cities from cars?’, you are probably wondering. The horse crisis was solved by accident; the development of the automobile wasn’t on the agenda of politicians or city planners, it was driven by private companies and businessmen. And yet it managed to change and disrupt mobility in a most radical way and the cities had to adapt.
Today, cars instead of horses are congesting our cities. Again, city authorities feel helpless and struggle to find solutions. And just as in 1900, it is private business ideas and initiatives that aspire to turn today’s mobility upside down.
The solution to our ‘horse crisis’ has already been invented, and is only a few steps away from taking over the world. But unlike the car, back in the 1800s, this time the solution will be a triumvirate of three disruptive technologies: shared mobility, autonomous vehicles and electrification. Taken in isolation, they do not seem to be powerful enough to solve the problem, but combined they have the potential to re-shape mobility as we know it.
Shared not owned
For the so called Millennials, the generation born between 1983 and 2000 and thus the car owners and users of the future, the situation is clear: they like the convenience of a car, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be their own.
Weighing the costs and benefits and taking into account the high level of connectivity, more people than ever opt to not own or even drive a car. Consequently, 42 per cent of the Millennials are willing to use car-sharing. Shared mobility services coupled with technology are proven to be a hit in metropolitan areas, cities, and even on university campuses, and are showing the way forward for cities and the automotive industry. As with many disruptive technologies, this is generating some severe issues and friction that is leading them to be illegal in many cities.
It is not hard to understand why. London has seen a meteoric rise in these types of vehicles that, according to many, is starting to erode the gains achieved by the introduction of congestion charging brought to the city, with a growth on private hire vehicles estimated at 20,000 from 2014 – 2015. Of course posing a threat to the livelihood of the London cab drivers that became an icon of the city, has helped the media cause, resulting in much commotion and publicity. Shared mobility could well be part of the solution, however, only when combined with autonomous vehicles it develops its full potential. The automotive industry and mobility service providers race to be the first to present solutions, test their concepts on the roads and win the customers. Only months ago, Uber rushed forward by introducing a fleet of self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, enabling customers to call an autonomous cab.
But this isn’t yet the key technology. The full benefits of automation will come later on when the infrastructure adapts to the technology of autonomous vehicles. The infrastructure in cities is all around the car, with its driver being a human, which is why we have lags at traffic lights, why traffic signs are coloured and shaped in certain ways, and why roads are designed with tolerances for human behaviour. In future, we won’t need to take this into consideration any more.
Imagine no more intersections for vehicles, and pedestrians taking control of the flow of traffic. Vehicles will even not be required to stop, but can vary their speed and accelerations in the city and all the city traffic parameters will be uploaded and controlled in the cloud.
Electrify everything
Electrification of the fleet will also be a part of this jigsaw. Replacing conventional engines with electric motors will just be the beginning. We already see energy and smart grids becoming greener and more efficient every day. Soon roads could become energy generators, charging cars as they drive, making charging stations less necessary and range issues a thing of the past.
This way of transferring energy may also provide cities with a form of traffic management with minimal input required: the charging rate could depend on the amount of kilometers driven, or on the popularity of a street, inducing people to take another route and thus reducing congestion risk.
Benefitting the future
All this technology jointly – and only jointly – will enable cities to be greener and to develop themselves with a focus on users and not on mode. It will be a much more open system, enabling us to develop spaces for people and not for vehicles, as in the past. It is only a matter of time for this transformation to fully take place. If we embrace it and steer it into the right direction, it will benefit us all.
This is why we at PTV Group assess the impacts these technologies will have on cities, working together with teams from the cities themselves, research, academia, startups and the automotive industry. We want to be at the heart of this disruption, developing the tools that address the needs of the city of tomorrow in planning, operating, real-time traffic management and delivering users information.
We want to ensure that the transition is better planned and understood than the one in the late 19th century, that mistakes are minimised and that, through an urban mobility community, we can ultimately deliver an environmentally-friendly, safe and resource-effective world – the three pillars of what moves us at PTV Group.

Mobility Revolution.
Discussions about mobility have traditionally referred to cars, public transit, and cycling or walking, but technological change in the sector is spurring changes that will improve people’s lives, help protect the environment and transform cities, said industry experts at a recent event in Sydney.Speaking at  ‘The Mobility Revolution’, held on 29 May as part of Sydney’s Vivid festival and organised by American automotive giant Ford, business and government leaders shared that technologies like drones and driverless vehicles have the potential to solve some of Australia’s—and the world’s—most difficult problems.





How driverless cars will free cities from congestion




These include traffic congestion, a lack of access to transport for people with disabilities, and how to deliver essential supplies to communities in the wake of disasters such as floods.
Graeme Whickman, president and chief executive officer, Ford Australia and New Zealand, told the 150-strong audience at Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art that in Australia, mobility is already a pressing challenge: It is the world’s second most congested country after New Zealand; and with the country’s population set to soar from 24 million today to more than 40 million by 2060, the problem is set to intensify.
Congestion already results in “avoidable social costs”—that is, losses due to delays, vehicle operating expenses, and vehicle emissions—of about A$16.5 billion (US$12.6 billion) in 2015 according to the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport & Regional Economics (BITRE), and this could increase to A$30 billion by 2030, shared Whickman.
“The automotive solutions that have served us for the last century will not serve us for the next 100 years,” said Whickman. He added that this is why Ford’s sole focus is no longer selling more cars, but rather, providing mobility.
This belief led Ford in late 2015 to pilot an initiative known as “dynamic shuttles“, said Whickman. These are buses that could be summoned by employees using their smartphones, rather than plying fixed routes. One such vehicle has the ability to take between 11 and 25 vehicles off the road, shared Whickman.
The International Transport Forum has produced research that backs these claims. A 2016 study on the potential impacts of shared fleets of driverless vehicles in cities has the potential to take nine out of 10 cars off city streets.
“There is a clear need for mobility solutions that don’t revolve around more vehicles on the road,” said Whickman, adding that such solutions could help address traffic congestion, as well as cut carbon emissions by taking cars off the road.
The company is also investing heavily in developing autonomous, or driverless vehicle technology, said Whickman. The company has plans to have a fully autonomous vehicle in operation by 2021.
This goal is in service of a core belief that “mobility, and the advantages that come with it, are a human right,” Whickman noted.
About one in five Australians has a disability; that’s about 4.2 million people. While not all individuals with disabilities would struggle with mobility, 2011 research from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that 87 per cent of people with disabilities said their impairment restricted their ability to perform communication, mobility, or self-care activities.

Mobility, and the advantages that come with it, are a human right.
Graeme Whickman, president and chief executive officer, Ford Australia and New Zealand

For such individuals, mobility could open up barriers preventing them from providing for themselves and their families, said Whickman. It could also enhance the quality of life for elderly people whose deteriorating vision hampers their ability to drive independently.
Another technology that will change the way individuals move, and how goods and services are delivered, is drones.
Catherine Ball, co-creator of the World Drones Congress, said that “drones are on the cusp of going from games to being serious solutions”.
Whereas the devices have been used for lightweight purposes such as aerial photography and videography or just recreational use, they can have a major impact in many spheres of life, said Ball.
Drones have been used for environmental purposes such as monitoring the health of the Great Barrier Reef; documenting and learning about a newly discovered species of Australian dolphin; and surveying turtle populations along vast stretches of the Australian coastline.
But drones can also have life-saving impacts, said Ball. Applications include transporting blood or even organs to remote rural areas where they are urgently needed—an idea that is already being explored in Africa and India; delivering aid and supplies to disaster-struck areas where road access has been cut off; and even rescuing people from burning buildings.
In the United Arab Emirates, government officials plan to have autonomous taxi drones operational in Dubai by later this year, Ball added.
“Science fiction is becoming reality,” said Ball. While some countries such as Singapore are racing ahead to capitalise on this technology—the city-state is developing unmanned traffic management solutions so that drones can fly around safely—progress towards widespread adoption has been slow in other countries such as Australia.
“It is frustrating,” said Ball, because Australia has been exploring—and legislating for—commercial drone use since the early 2000s. The country is in a strong position to teach the world how to regulate for safe and ethical drone use, but adoption has been limited by challenges such as lukewarm public opinion due to privacy and safety concerns, as well as security issues.
Despite these challenges, change is inevitable, said Ball. “We need to engage people rather than sleepwalk into it, and then realising you don’t like the outcomes,” she stressed. “Early stage engagement with technology and the ecosystem is absolutely fundamental.”

The way that people get around cities is changing dramatically. Technological advances and new transportation services are making it possible for city dwellers to cross town ever more efficiently and safely. These shifts could have profound economic and social effects. McKinsey analysis indicates that in 50 metropolitan areas around the world, home to 500 million people, integrated mobility systems could produce benefits, such as improved safety and reduced pollution, worth up to $600 billion.
Because each city is unique, the transition to integrated mobility will also play out differently, and produce different results, from one city to the next. The pace and extent of change will depend on factors such as population density, household income, public investment, the state of roads and public-transit infrastructure, pollution and congestion levels, and local governance capabilities.
The private sector will exert important influences, too, as companies adjust to new consumer behaviors. Utilities, for example, will need to manage possible increases in electricity demand resulting from the wider use of electric vehicles. Automakers can expect the automotive revenue pool to grow and diversify as the mix of vehicles sold tilts toward electric and autonomous vehicles. The trend toward connected cars will affect technology companies and insurers, causing disruption and creating opportunities in areas such as data analytics.1
With all these forces at work, the transition to integrated mobility will be complicated, even challenging at times. Some cities can get an early start, while others will need to work on developing the right conditions. No matter how ready a city is to move toward advanced mobility models, municipal officials can already begin developing a vision for what integrated mobility ought to look like and how their cities might evolve accordingly. More important, they can consider how to manage the transition so that its benefits are maximized in line with local priorities for improving residents’ quality of life.
To help city leaders structure their thinking, we have created scenarios for how mobility might change in three types of cities: dense cities in developed economies, dense cities in emerging economies, and sprawling metropolitan areas in developed economies. Each scenario accounts for present-day conditions and highlights both opportunities and challenges. In this article, we lay out these visions for the future of mobility, along with ideas about how municipal officials and other urban stakeholders can help their cities navigate toward positive outcomes.
Trends influencing urban mobility
Fast-moving trends are influencing urban-mobility systems around the world. Some trends, like vehicle electrification and the development of autonomous-driving technology, relate directly to mobility. Other, broader trends will also have important implications. The decentralization of energy systems, for example, will make a difference as modes of transportation come to rely more and more on electricity as an energy source. The following trends are likely to have the biggest impact on the development of integrated mobility in cities.
Shared mobility. Ride-hailing services have grown rapidly over the past few years and now compete not only with traditional car-sharing and car-pooling providers but also with public transit and private vehicle ownership. Investments in ride-hailing companies have taken off, too, more than doubling to $11.3 billion in 2015 from $5.3 billion in 2014.
Autonomous driving. Advances in autonomous-driving technology promise to resolve road-safety concerns, reduce the cost of transportation, and expand access to mobility. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) should turn driving time into free time. AVs could also lead to higher overall vehicle mileage, as people take advantage of their convenience by making more trips or even sending AVs to run errands for them.
Vehicle electrification. Global electric-vehicle (EV) sales have risen quickly, from 50,000 in 2011 to nearly 450,000 in 2015. Purchase subsidies, falling battery costs, fuel-economy regulations, and product improvements have contributed to the increase. Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that battery costs will drop below $100 per kilowatt-hour in the next decade. If that happens, EVs should achieve cost competitiveness with conventional vehicles.2
Connectivity and the Internet of Things. The spread of IoT applications into vehicles and infrastructure will generate data with a variety of uses. For city dwellers, software systems can facilitate trip planning and guide AVs based on real-time conditions. Transit authorities could use the same data to analyze the movement of people and vehicles, identify bottlenecks, adjust services, and make long-term transit plans.
Public transit. Cities around the world are expanding and improving their public-transit networks. Adding autonomous features to transit vehicles may reduce operating costs, while new deployment models such as fleets of shared vehicles can make transit more flexible and accessible. Using data from IoT-enabled infrastructure can help planners to add capacity and improve reliability so that mass transit remains competitive with private vehicles and mobility services.
Infrastructure. The United Nations Population Division projects that the world’s urban population will increase by more than two-thirds by 2050.3 Such an influx of people could put more strain on city roads, bridges, and tunnels that are already struggling to keep up with increases in vehicle miles. But infrastructure upgrades that favor public or shared transit and bicycling could reinforce a shift away from car ownership.
Decentralization of energy systems. If the cost of renewable power generation continues to fall, then intermittent distributed generation will produce a notable share of the world’s electricity over the next 15 years. These trends could accelerate EV uptake by making electricity cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable. Residential solar and energy-storage systems let EV owners recharge their vehicles without buying electricity at retail rates. (In some places, it is already less expensive to power a vehicle with electricity than with liquid fuel.) These systems also reduce demand on urban power grids, which helps to lower electricity prices at peak times and to free more capacity for vehicle charging.
Regulation. As advanced mobility services and technologies have penetrated cities, public officials at the city, regional, and national levels have responded by establishing an array of new regulations. These regulations reflect local priorities and stakeholder influences, which have not always favored integrated mobility. National or state-level regulations, such as tax breaks and incentives for EVs, have given a boost to integrated mobility in many cities, but local regulations, such as traffic rules that reserve bus-only lanes on city streets, could be even more consequential. To capture the benefits of integrated mobility, governments may want to consider creating regulations that encourage consumer-friendly developments while also promoting larger public goals, such as clean air and reduced congestion.
Individually, these trends will have a profound influence. As they unfold in tandem, their effects could be reinforced and multiplied (Exhibit 1). For example, AVs would reduce the cost difference between private car ownership and ride hailing, leading to greater use of shared mobility services. This would affect public transit: research shows that the more people use shared transportation, the more likely they are to use public transit. The adoption of both private and shared AVs should also increase mobility consumption, which would favor the adoption of EVs, since they are more economical than conventional cars when vehicle utilization rates are high.

Exhibit 1


How cities can manage the transition to integrated mobility
Broadly speaking, integrated mobility systems could improve the lives of city dwellers in several respects. One is environmental quality. As more urban journeys shift—to EVs, shared mobility services, and public transit—tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and fine airborne particulates in cities should go down. This will help reduce health problems, such as respiratory diseases, heart attacks, and premature births, that are aggravated by local air pollution.
The well-being of citizens should also improve as smarter forms of urban transport prevent traffic accidents. The World Health Organization estimates that 1.25 million people died in road crashes in 2015. But a shift toward AVs would prevent many crashes, and the ensuing traffic slowdowns, by eliminating the human errors that cause the majority of accidents.
Then there is the problem of traffic congestion, which costs more than 1 percent of GDP globally. Congestion could be eased by connected AVs (which can boost the throughput of roads by driving closer together) and sophisticated traffic-management systems, such as dynamic tolling. Other benefits of advanced mobility include expanded access to mobility for citizens who either cannot drive or live far from transport hubs, and the extra free time people will gain from using AVs, shared vehicles, and mass transit more than they do now.

This is not to say that the transition to integrated mobility will have no drawbacks. Shifts in employment, for example, could occur as more AVs and EVs roll out, reducing the need for drivers and mechanics. City officials will also need to make sure that the cost of mobility is equitable, that increases in passenger and vehicle miles resulting from the use of AVs do not worsen pollution, traffic, or safety, and that public transit improves the mobility system as a whole. To maximize the benefits of the mobility transition and prevent changes from imposing significant costs on society, city officials will need to pay attention to several critical topics.

Mass transit. Mass public transit will be essential to preventing congestion as more vehicles take to the road. But if mass transit is infrequent or slow or otherwise unsatisfactory, city residents might switch to low-cost, on-demand shared mobility services, thereby making traffic worse. Governments will need to make sure that mass transit remains a widely appealing alternative to private mobility. Cities might also consider encouraging people to use mass transit by subsidizing trips to and from transit hubs via shared services.
Land use. Changes in the number and mix of city vehicles will have important implications for how land is managed. Consider one relatively mundane land-use issue: parking. Parking space occupies up to 15 percent of public land in sprawling metropolitan areas. Shrinking vehicle fleets should make it possible to repurpose some of that space. But some of it will still need to serve the mobility system. Turning some on-street parking spots into zones where passengers can climb into and out of vehicles might improve the flow of traffic. Cities can also consider managing their future development so that it does not result in inefficient land-use patterns.
Revenue. Disruptive change to mobility systems could alter the tax bases of many cities. In the Seamless Mobility or Clean and Shared scenarios, extensive adoption of EVs could reduce revenues from fuel taxes by 20 to 65 percent unless taxation systems are reconfigured. On the other hand, connectivity and the Internet of Things could be used to levy and collect new taxes for the use of infrastructure on a per-mile basis or for time spent driving in heavily traveled districts.
Infrastructure. On average, new roads become congested within seven years. Building more roads may not be enough to accommodate the increases in passenger and vehicle miles that we have projected. Cities will need some mechanisms to lessen demand on roads, such as dynamic pricing. They can also apply new measures to increase capacity. Just as some areas now reserve lanes for low-emissions or high-occupancy vehicles, cities could set aside AV-only lanes so AVs can travel at higher speeds than they might in lanes where they would be surrounded by human-driven vehicles.

Envisioning the future(s) of urban mobility: Three scenarios
To help officials and planners anticipate the future of mobility, we have developed three scenarios. Each one is linked to a particular type of city, defined by levels of economic development, household income, and population density. By looking at today’s conditions and modeling how mobility trends could play out in each scenario, we can offer city planners some ideas about which trends might advance more quickly than others, and what the effects those trends could have on safety, traffic, and the environment. Our analysis suggests that the Seamless Mobility scenario for dense, developed cities would produce the most societal benefits, and that the Clean and Shared scenario for dense, developing cities and the Private Autonomy scenario for high-income, low-density cities would also have significant benefits (Exhibit 2).

Exhibit 2


Dense, developing cities
Densely settled cities in developing countries face a serious mobility squeeze. Congestion is severe, partly because roads and other forms of transport infrastructure are inadequate and in disrepair, and partly because traffic patterns are complex. Heavy air pollution takes a toll on the health of urban residents. And rapid population growth creates more demand for mobility by the day.
This set of conditions favors the emergence of what we call a Clean and Shared model for urban mobility, characterized by the following shifts:

More infrastructure improvements. The most valuable upgrades will be those that make it easier for people to get around using modes of transportation, such as shared mobility services and mass transit, that do not worsen traffic congestion, air pollution, or other pressing problems. Without better infrastructure, though, the benefits of integrated mobility could be curtailed.
The expansion of cost-effective forms of transport. High-capacity public transport and shared mobility services will probably do the most to satisfy rising demand for mobility. We estimate that by 2030, shared light vehicles could account for a third of vehicle-miles traveled in an average-size city.
Little uptake of AVs. Public and shared mobility services will likely favor vehicles driven by people, because labor costs are low, sustaining employment remains a priority for policy makers, and AVs might be stymied by bad roads and heavy traffic.
A shift toward EVs. This would be enabled by advances in decentralized renewable-power generation (for example, rooftop solar) and motivated by concerns about air pollution. We project that approximately 40 percent of vehicles in developing, dense cities will be electric by 2030. These developments could create challenges for utilities, however, given the aging power grids in many dense, developing cities.

Some 15 developing, dense cities, including Delhi, Istanbul, and Mumbai, appear well-positioned to make early transitions to integrated mobility, based on their population sizes, above-average GDP per capita, record of implementing public projects effectively, and urgent pollution and congestion problems.
According to our forecasts, these cities stand to gain a lot from mobility advances. We estimate that a developing, dense city of average size could realize $600 million in annual societal benefits by 2030. From 2015 to 2030, these benefits would add up to between $3 billion and $4 billion, or $2,200 to $2,800 per resident. Nearly four-fifths of these benefits will result from improvements in safety (Exhibit 3).

Exhibit 3


High-income, low-density cities
In the sprawling, suburban-style municipalities of Europe and North America, residents rely mainly on private cars to get around. They also spend considerable amounts of time on the road. Places like these are conducive to a Private Autonomy model, in which private cars still dominate the mobility mix but new technologies enable different uses. The main features of the Private Autonomy model are as follows:

Extensive uptake of AVs. Most of these will be EVs. This shift would eliminate much of the work of driving, giving drivers more free time. It could also reduce traffic congestion, particularly if cities use infrastructure, such as dedicated AV lanes, to boost AVs’ efficiency. On the other hand, as AVs make it more pleasant to travel by car, they could increase the demand for mobility and even encourage more low-density development.
More shared mobility. These services (along with private AVs) could mobilize the elderly, the young, and other groups that cannot drive. They could also spare low-income groups the expense of owning cars. Greater access to mobility, along with the spread of AVs as described above, could cause a 25 percent increase in passenger miles by 2030, according to our forecasts.
Higher-impact public transit. Efficient, flexible, and affordable mass transit, especially along major commuting arteries, will be needed to reduce traffic congestion—but will also face competition from private mobility services. Cities can explore ways of enhancing public transit so that it remains an appealing alternative to private transportation and meets the mobility needs of people who depend on it.

As we see it, the Private Autonomy model is likely to catch on first in developed suburban cities with high per capita GDP, openness to new technologies, and a successful record of implementing public projects. Such places include Houston, the Ruhr area of Germany, and Sydney.
We estimate that a high-income, low-density metropolitan area of average size could realize $500 million in annual societal benefits by 2030—enough to boost its GDP by 0.9 percent. From 2015 to 2030, the benefits would amount to $2 billion to $3 billion for the city and $1,800 to $3,300 per resident (Exhibit 4).

Exhibit 4


About half of those benefits would come from improvements in passenger and pedestrian safety. Most of the remaining benefits would come from the avoided cost of congestion, assuming that connected AVs are widely used and cities attempt to maximize the efficiency of AVs. But environmental benefits would be small because of an overall rise in vehicle miles.
Dense, developed cities
Good-quality mass transit is the mainstay of urban mobility in high-income, densely settled cities. Some residents supplement their use of public transit with privately owned cars or shared vehicles. E-hailing services have also expanded quickly in these cities. The fact that advanced mobility services have won acceptance in dense, developed cities suggests that AVs and newer forms of shared mobility, such as peer-to-peer car sharing, will also blend in well. The result would be what we term the Seamless Mobility model: a flexible, highly responsive system that moves residents quickly from place to place, sometimes by switching among modes of transport. The signature elements of this model are as follows:

A shared fleet of public AVs. This fleet could provide many residents with affordable mobility. Using EVs is likely to be most economical. We expect people to travel up to 30 percent more, leading to an overall increase in vehicle miles. This could cause more traffic congestion unless the right planning measures are taken. However, the high utilization of shared AVs should reduce fleet sizes.
Integrated mobility platforms. These will allow cities to gather data from connected vehicles and infrastructure about prices, schedules, and real-time conditions. Cities could use the data to make smarter improvements and give riders the ability to plan and pay for trips, even using multiple providers.
Enhanced public transit. Mass-transit rail systems, walking, and cycling will still offer unrivaled speed and capacity for many journeys. New technologies will enable improvements, such as live updates on the arrival times of buses and trains. And a public AV fleet could offer a more convenient, lower-cost means of transport than buses running along fixed routes. Such changes may be needed to ensure that public transit remains viable.
Catalytic urban planning. Planners can alter the urban landscape to enhance mobility. This might involve instituting congestion pricing to prevent traffic slowdowns or demarcating low-emissions zones to speed the uptake of EVs, among other possible changes. If the number of vehicles in Seamless Mobility cities goes down, as we expect it to, and AVs can be directed to park outside city centers, this would reduce the need for parking space and free valuable land area for other uses.

Fifteen dense, developed metropolitan areas have the high-quality public-transit systems, infrastructure-investment capacity, and expertise with public projects that should help them advance toward a Seamless Mobility system before other cities. These pioneer cities include London, Shanghai, and Singapore.
We estimate that Seamless Mobility would yield the greatest social benefits of any integrated model: up to $2.5 billion per year by 2030 in an average city, enough to boost its GDP by as much as 3.9 percent. From 2015 to 2030, the cumulative benefit would be $30 billion to $45 billion, or $6,000 to $7,400 per resident (Exhibit 5). Most of the benefit will come from reduced congestion—provided that cities install infrastructure to let AVs and mass-transit vehicles operate efficiently. Safety and emissions will likely improve on a per-mile basis, but overall increases in mileage will mean that the absolute gains in safety and emissions will remain relatively modest, at just 15 percent of total benefits.

Exhibit 5



Advances in mobility are already affecting the transportation systems of major cities around the world, though not uniformly. Ride-hailing services, for example, have seen much faster growth than car sharing or EVs. Cities are mostly dealing with these trends in isolation. But cities can gain advantages by looking at the future of mobility in a comprehensive, integrated way that anticipates the dependencies and reinforcing effects among trends. This helps them understand the potential pace and impact of change, analyze trade-offs, and lay out helpful policy prescriptions. Cities that do this well stand a better chance of shaping the future of mobility in a way that balances benefits with potential adverse effects, and thereby improves the lives of their residents.

Vehicle sharing is one of the possible answers to the increasing demand of sustainable way of transport. However, the traditional management models of sharing services are not flexible enough to be a real answer to current and future mobility needs. Green Move, an ongoing project financed by Regione Lombardia that involves eight different research centers of Politecnico di Milano, has the objective to design and test a vehicle-sharing system, with different categories of electric vehicles. The service will have the following characteristics: multi-ownership, allowing single users, private companies, and associations to join the service both using vehicles provided by the service itself and sharing their personal electric car or fleet, this represents an application of a peer2peer approach in the field of sustainable mobility; the Green e-Box, a device that will be the bridge between user, vehicle and control center, potentially compatible with any vehicle; key-less-mobility, meaning that personal smartphones will be the accesskey to the Green Move fleet, avoiding the use of smart-cards or physical keys. The design of a full scale service for the city of Milano will be carried out by a multi-criteria assessment of a wide number of possible alternative options in order to identify the most feasible and effective one. Indicators will be identified to measure the performance on relevant dimensions (i.e. economic and financial sustainability, social benefits, environmental effects). A trial to test the operating modes and the service efficiency will be carried out with electric vehicles and docking stations in a specific area of Milan, establishing a connection with the present traditional electric car sharing service owned by the Region. The performance of the service in term of accessibility and usability will be measured with a specific monitoring system. The paper aims to give a general overview of the project and a focus on the methodology in use for the full scale service design.

New Delhi: The number of electric cars on the roads around the world rose to 2 million in 2016, following a year of strong growth in 2015, according to the latest edition of the International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook.
China remained the largest market in 2016, accounting for more than 40% of the electric cars sold in the world. With more than 200 million electric two-wheelers and more than 300,000 electric buses, China is by far the global leader in the electrification of transport. China, the US and Europe made up the three main markets, totalling over 90% of all EVs sold around the world.
In Norway, electric cars had a 29% market share last year, the highest globally, followed by the Netherlands with 6.4%, and Sweden with 3.4%. The electric car market is set to transition from early deployment to mass market adoption over the next decade or so, says the Global EV Outlook.
Between 9 and 20 million electric cars could be deployed by 2020, and between 40 and 70 million by 2025, according to estimates based on recent statement from carmakers.
Still, electric vehicles only made up 0.2% of total passenger light-duty vehicles in circulation in 2016. They have a long way to go before reaching numbers capable of making a significant contribution to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.
In order to limit temperature increases to below 2°C by the end of the century, the number of electric cars will need to reach 600 million by 2040, according to IEA’s Energy Technology Perspectives. Strong policy support will be necessary to keep EVs on track.
Cities are taking leadership roles in encouraging EV adoption, often because of concerns about air quality. Major urban centres often achieve higher EV market shares compared to national averages. A third of global EV sales took place in 14 cities in 2015.
Paris, for instance, has mandated that any electric car is allowed to re-charge at the re-charge stations of its car-sharing program, called Autolib.
Amsterdam has a strategy of offering the installation of charging points on public parking spaces to people who make a request, ensuring that charging infrastructure is installed where it’s actually needed. London for its part encourages EV adoption by waiving its congestion charge.
The analysis shows that fleet procurement is an important means of encouraging early EV uptake. Fleet operators, both public and private, can contribute significantly to the deployment of EVs, first from demand signals that they send to the market, and second thanks to their broader role as amplifiers in promoting and facilitating the uptake of EVs by their staff and customers.
Clear and ambitious policy support is vital to keep the growth of EVs on track. Despite impressive improvements in costs and energy density over the past decade, battery packs are still expensive, driving up retail prices. Financial incentives for EV adoption and taxes on fossil fuels will continue to be important in the current phase of EV technology deployment to initiate and reinforce a positive feedback loop that, through increasing sales, production scale-ups and technology learning, will further support cost reductions for batteries and other components.

Many studies show that carsharing reduces transportation costs for a large segment of the population. Carsharing also reduces the number of private vehicles on the road because carshare members do not purchase their own cars. However, the traditional carsharing business model is difficult to scale geographically to neighborhoods with lower population densities because the operator must bear the upfront fixed cost of purchasing or leasing the vehicles in the fleet. In contrast to traditional carsharing, peer-to-peer (P2P) carsharing allows car owners to convert their personal vehicles into shared cars that can be rented to other drivers on a short-term basis. This model helps to improve the situation in which most privately owned vehicles sit idle more than 90% of the day. P2P carsharing alleviates upfront costs and thus is more economically consistent with lower-density neighborhoods than is traditional carsharing. As a result, P2P carsharing provides greater potential for car  accessibility than traditional carsharing does. Several new service companies are dedicated to P2P carsharing. A methodology was developed to assess the market feasibility of P2P carsharing. The methodology was applied to develop a case study of P2P carsharing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The market for P2P carsharing was found to be economically viable. However, uncertain and fragmented public policy and car insurance regimes threatened the growth and investment in P2P carsharing.
The paper explores the feasibility of a scalable form of carsharing, called peer-to-peer (P2P) carsharing. P2P carsharing allows car owners to convert their personal vehicles into share cars that can be rented to other drivers on a short-term basis. As of 2007, more than 237 million private vehicles were owned and operated in the United States. This business model helps to alleviate the situation in which most privately owned vehicles sit idle over 90% of the day. The utilization requirements are greatly reduced, and much of the risk of geographic expansion is removed with P2P carsharing.
CONCLUSION
Given the increasing costs of private car ownership and the increasing worldwide focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions attributable to transportation, development of both supply-side and demand-side innovations are required. One such demand-side innovation is mainstream adoption of carsharing. An established stream of literature has documented the many benefits of carsharing to individuals and the planet. However, current business models of traditional carsharing providers hinder their scalability to areas with less dense populations.
P2P carsharing aims to provide a scalable form of carsharing, with the potential to address both the high costs of private vehicle ownership and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The paper develops a methodology to assess the feasibility of P2P carsharing in a given area and the economic incentives to market participants.

Next time you get stuck in a traffic jam, have a look around at your commuters stuck behind the wheel. Chances are, most of them will have something in common: They are suffering alone.
Congestion happens when our roads can’t cope with the volume of cars using them. For decades, our default response has been to invest billions in new lanes and more roads. But witness the gridlock in our major cities. We can’t build roads fast enough, and even if we could, there wouldn’t be enough land to do so.
Getting India moving again will take a concerted effort, by individuals, corporates and the Government. It requires sustained investment in public transit, progressive regulations and a behavioural change in the way people commute. And the starting point for us would be to look at how we use millions of private cars on the road today.
Personal car ownership remains an aspiration for many. But it comes with heavy costs that we all must shoulder: traffic jams that leech India’s productivity and the pollution that increasingly shrouds many of our finest cities.
Cars that cost us lakhs of rupees, sit idle 96 percent of the time. That’s right: cars are used just four percent of the day and they are one of the most expensive possessions a family owns. That’s just the start of the waste. People spend hours each week sitting behind the wheel of a car. And the congestion caused by all that individual car use is costing India billions a year in lost productivity.
As people around the globe celebrate World Environment Day, let’s consider how we can better share those cars. Because by getting more people into fewer cars, or carpooling, we can contribute to a sustainable mobility future.
Of course, carpooling is not a new idea. People in India and elsewhere have for decades been carpooling – whether it is the Jitney or our very own shared rickshaws. But thanks to modern technology, we now have a way to use all cars on the road for public good—and at no extra cost to the taxpayer.
Today, apps like Uber can instantly match passengers headed in the same direction at the same time. We call this service uberPOOL, and it’s a model that’s proven to work in some of the world’s largest cities. Over 20% of commuters globally are today choosing to share their ride.
In India, uberPOOL is currently available in New Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata and Pune, has helped save 3.45 million litres of fuel, 73.4 million kms travelled, curbing 8.1 million kgs of CO2 emissions in India.
We now have the technology to make our cities more livable and less congested. But reducing our dependence on cars will require a cultural shift as much as a technological one. For decades, cars have been a status symbol. But attitudes are starting to change. Today, we are seeing many families give up on their second cars, and many others using UberPOOL to save costs. Interestingly, we are seeing many women commuters use UberMOTO as their preferred first/ last mile connectivity transportation.
As India considers ways to cut congestion, it should investigate laws that would encourage ride-sharing. We don’t have to wait five or 10 years to create the cities of the future. With progressive regulations and the technology already in our pockets, we can build mobility alternatives for smart cities of today.
So next time you are stuck in traffic at National Highway 8 (NH8) in Delhi, NCR or Outer Ring Road (ORR) in Bangalore, looking at fellow motorists travelling alone, imagine a world of shared mobility. We can start reclaiming our time today with the cars already on the road and technology already in our pockets. We just need to pool together.

Reshaping Mobility: digitization continues to plough its way through whole industries, changing such old worlds as retail and finance in ways big and small. In the world of mobility and transport, a number of forces are driving massive shifts in the expectations and the needs of those who run or use our transportation systems: commuters, shippers, and many more.
We’re only just starting to see the outlines and contours of the big changes underway. The shifts now taking shape are being propelled by advances in technology, shifting socioeconomic factors, and public policy.
More than a million people die each year on the world’s roads. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, there were more than 5 million crashes and 32,000 fatalities on U.S. roads in 2014.
With more than a billion cars on roads worldwide, the near-term goals for connected mobility solutions must include enabling both transport system operators and users to make more informed decisions that reduce travel delays. Congestion causes 5.5 billion hours of travel delay each year, and urban congestion in the U.S. alone costs over $100 billion annually. Drivers in the UK’s top 10 congested cities waste more than 55 hours a year in traffic.
Reshaping Mobility. The forces now creating massive change in transportation are many, but a few of the most important are worth discussing here:
Technology is increasing connectivity.
As consumers of information, we have personal electronics and navigation systems, and most of the time we probably have more information about the current status of traffic than the experts in the traffic management centers. Without better visibility, they can’t serve our needs very well. Networks (whether wired or wireless) built to support rail, other mass transit, and some public safety operations, have typically been built around proprietary solutions. Many of them were put in place decades ago, which means that we now must deal with aging and disparate networks that are growing prohibitively expensive to operate and manage. Fragmented communications among multiple networks creates gaps in connectivity which, in turn, introduce public safety risks for passengers, first responders, and citizens. It’s widely accepted that improved communications between mass transit, emergency response vehicles, and the existing traffic management infrastructure helps to optimize the routing of vehicles, further reducing potential delays.
Socioeconomic forces and urbanization are driving the need for more efficient transportation systems.
Today, we have more people living in cities than in rural areas, which increases traffic and congestion. An aging population forces us to consider mobility issues in terms of elderly access to healthcare and daily services. Global supply chains have disrupted traffic patterns in many countries; as countries go from insourcing to outsourcing and then go from outsourcing to insourcing again, supply chains are continually, dynamically being rerouted. This causes major new influxes of trucking and logistics companies to handle the freight associated with those changes, along with increased traffic congestion.
Passengers are demanding constant Wi-Fi connections to their devices while in transit.
Transportation operators have to do more with less; they need to attract more riders, keep their operating costs down, and potentially rely on new business models. As technology evolves, so must public safety and public security policies. Technology capabilities that were not available just a couple of years ago now require us to have public safety and public security officials upgrade their requirements to meet the opportunities created by emerging technologies.
Lack of interoperability isolates regional systems.
Disparities between regional transportation systems create headaches for travelers and any others who depend on modern transport systems. This is particularly problematic on a continent like Europe, where one can easily drive from country to country, and thereby experience the problems resulting from the deployment of disparate technologies, all lacking interoperability. This causes supply chain disruptions, and it reduces efficiency in logistics. Operating vehicles more efficiently means keeping them in motion, and driving them at maximum performance. Vehicles should not be sitting in congested city traffic, burning fossil fuels.
In order to ensure a smooth transition into an uncertain future any, the leaders of transportation and public safety organizations now believe that it’s become mission-critical to augment their existing radio and limited data networks with video and real-time data solutions. That’s the one of the best ways for first responders and operators to have the contextual awareness they need in a variety of incidents, including life-threatening situations, as well as daily operations.
All of the elements that constitute the world of transport and travel are being transformed  by the Internet of Things revolution — powered by digitization.  Reshaping mobility: Route planning; finding one’s way while in transit; traveling via mass transit, or on foot; collecting fares or tolls; congestion and road pricing; traffic management; video surveillance; choosing amongst different transportation options during any given trip; reducing trips through telecommuting—all of these are evolving at dizzying speed.
Many of the emerging innovations now effecting transportation are giving individuals greater choices as they seek to move around cities.  Anthony Foxx, the Obama administration’s Secretary of Transportation, put it this way: “The key word for transportation in the 21st century is ‘choice’ ”. Reshaping Mobility: travelers vary widely in age, amounts of disposable income for travel, abilities to move, degrees of independence, and destinations. How to move a 2 year-old is not the same as how to move a 28 year-old, nor a 38 year-old travelling with children. Adopting a truly new approach to transportation requires providing a much wider variety of choices.
Two of our most innovative leaders, one in transport and one in tech, have laid out the challenge in simple terms:

“Now is the time for us to look at vehicles the same way we look at smart phones, laptops and tablets; as pieces of a much bigger, richer network.”
 – Bill Ford, Executive Chairman, Ford Motor Company


“If transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology, then the day after tomorrow I would be able to get in a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.”
– W. Daniel Hillis, renowned inventor and engineer: Thinking Machines, Disney, Applied Minds, MIT

The advanced research team at the Gartner Group’s global headquarters had this conclusion to share: “Similar to the way telephones have evolved into smartphones, over the next 10 years automobiles will rapidly become ‘connected vehicles’ that access, consume, and create information and share it with drivers, passengers, public infrastructure, and machines including other cars.”
Reshaping Mobility: a true evolution in our thinking is only possible when we come to see vehicles, roadways, trains, stations, airports and shipping ports not simply as modes of transportation. They are nodes in a connected network just like our smartphones, laptops, and tablets. What happens when people, devices, processes and the underlying transportation infrastructure, as a whole, become more interconnected? One outcome is that the systems in place will enable more intelligent communication and decision-making. This evolution toward more holistic and data driven transportation systems can create greater safety, mobility and efficiency inside existing transportation systems.

The problem of CO2 Emissions.


In September 2013, over 40 Dutch organisations, including local governments, employers, unions, nature and environment organisations and financial institutes, entered into an Energy Agreement on sustainable growth (SER, 2013). The base of the agreement is formed by widely shared agreements on energy saving, clean technology and climate policy. Implementation of the agreed measures are to result in an affordable and clean energy supply, and will boost employment and opportunities for the Netherlands on the market for clean technology. The mobility and transport sector has a key role in the agreement. For 2020, the sector aims for a sizeable energy saving that, in addition to other measures, is to be achieved by the introduction of 100,000 very low-emission vehicles for car sharing. Whether and to what degree the introduction of this number of car-sharing vehicles in practice will contribute to energy and climate targets is unknown. The only comprehensive Dutch study into the environmental and mobility impact of car sharing is fairly dated (Meijkamp, 1998). Today, we know that that study’s estimation of the impact of car sharing was based on overly optimistic assumptions on technological developments. Moreover, the environmental impact of changes in car ownership was not taken into account, and the study was based on the behaviour of a limited group of early adopters, possibly with deviating behaviour; car sharing in those days was still in its infancy. However, even current car sharers do not represent the average Dutch person. Usually, they live in cities and, compared to the average, are higher educated, do not own their own car, and are single or have a young family. The reasons most often mentioned for car sharing appear to be the costs and hassle of car ownership. PBL has studied the impact of car sharing on mobility and the environment for the Dutch situation.


The main conclusions of the study are the following ones:


– There is over 30% less car ownership among car sharers than before they began car sharing. The ‘traditional’ car sharers, in particular, often indicated that they had since disposed of a privately owned car. The shared car mostly replaces a second or third car.
– Car sharers drive around 15% to 20% fewer car kilometres than before they started car sharing. This is mostly due to the fact that people who have disposed of a car now drive considerably less. The journeys that are now being made by shared car, before were made predominately by train or by using a borrowed or rented car.
– Car sharers emit between 175 and 265 fewer kilograms of CO2 per person, per year, due to their reduced car ownership. This is between 8% and 13% of the CO2 emissions related to car ownership and car use. About half of this reduction can be ascribed to less car use; the other half to the lower degree of car ownership.

In March 2014, there were around 10,000 shared cars on the Dutch roads. Scaling up to 100,000 shared cars would therefore mean a tenfold increase in the current number. If the number of people per shared car would remain the same, this would equal around 10% of all motorists becoming car sharers. This, in turn, would lead to a 0.2 to 0.3 Mt reduction in CO2 emissions. Around half of this reduction can be counted towards the reduction target in the Energy Agreement.It is therefore likely that scaling up car sharing, as is the Energy Agreement’s intention, will contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gases.

Increasing Ridesharing (Abstract)
One of the main obstacles that has challenged peer-to-peer (P2P) ridesharing systems in operating as stand-alone systems is reaching a critical mass of participants. Toward this goal, we propose what we call the P2P ride exchange mechanism to increase matching rate and customer retention in a ridesharing system. This mechanism gives riders the opportunity to purchase other riders’ itineraries while it provides suitable alternative rides to the sellers, thus increasing the service rate in a ridesharing system. The proposed mechanism aims to maximize expected user surplus, is robust towards selfish user manipulation, and has very low information requirements. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate what type of ridesharing systems can benefit the most from P2P ride exchange. Furthermore, we study the impact of customer flexibility on the rate of exchange. If implemented properly, P2P ride exchange can effectively increase the number of served riders and enhance customer loyalty by engaging customers in the ride-matching process.


1. Introduction
Peer-to-peer (P2P) dynamic ridesharing is a shared mobility alternative in which peer drivers and riders (passengers) share the space in the drivers’ personal vehicles. The term “P2P” implies that drivers are not hired by companies to transport passengers, but are rather using their personal vehicles to carry out their personal tasks, which makes them peers to riders. The term ’dynamic’ highlights the fact that customers can join the system at any point in time and do not have to book their trips in advance.
P2P ridesharing manages to eliminate vehicles from roads by getting people who are traveling in the same direction in the same vehicle. P2P ridesharing benefits drivers, riders, non-users, the transportation infrastructure, and the environment. Drivers receive monetary compensation for the service they provide while following their own daily schedules, and riders are charged less than other transportation alternatives, such as taxis. By reducing the number of traveling vehicles and hence congestion levels, the benefits of P2P ridesharing are extended to the entire community as well as the environment.
Contrary to traditional service businesses where servers belong to the business and their number is proportional to the demand for service, in P2P ridesharing servers are also customers. Therefore, it is important for the system operator to attract the right proportion of riders and drivers. Another feature of P2P ridesharing systems is that drivers typically have specific locations where they start and end their trips, and tight travel time windows to carry out their trips. This limits the level of spatiotemporal coverage of the network by each driver. Therefore, in order to serve a higher number of riders, a ridesharing system needs to increase the spatiotemporal coverage of the network by increasing the number of drivers. To motivate, attract and retain a high number of drivers, a high number of riders is necessary. Therefore, the number of customers in a P2P ridesharing system should pass a certain critical mass with a specific proportion of drivers to riders, in order for the system to be able to operate independently and without a need for outsourcing supply.
A ride-matching algorithm is the engine of a P2P ridesharing system, determining how drivers and riders should be paired. Except for very simple and non-efficient ridesharing systems (which we will discuss later), the ride-matching problems are computationally hard to solve. A good ride-matching method is one that can provide the highest number of matches in an attempt to engage the highest number of customers and bypass the critical mass of participants.
Customer experience is another factor that plays a role in the success of a P2P ridesharing system, especially during the initial phases of implementing the system. A customer (rider or driver) may give the system a chance by attempting to use the system a few times, but if he/she is not matched, there is a possibility that such a customer would never return to the system. Therefore, it is essential for a P2P ridesharing system to involve and retain as many customers as possible.
Customers in many transportation systems are served on a first-come, first-served (FCFS) or a similarly pre-ordered basis. For P2P ridesharing, in which customer retention is especially important, considering riders on an FCFS basis is an inefficient use of the very limited available resources (drivers). The FCFS rule, however, is the natural order of serving riders in a dynamic system, where riders announce their trips not long before departure. In addition, dropping the FCFS principle may lead to high solution times for the resulting matching problem, and is therefore not an appropriate implementation strategy for a dynamic real-time system.
In this paper, we introduce what we call P2P ride exchange, a mechanism to improve the number of matches in an FCFS-based system. In a system where P2P ride exchange is implemented, riders will still be considered for service on an FCFS basis. Upon joining the system, a rider will be offered the best available itinerary, according to certain criteria which we will discuss later. However, if no match exists, the rider will be given the chance to buy a previously-matched rider’s itinerary under specific circumstances. Purchasing an itinerary from a previously-matched rider is in fact reversing the FCFS rule. This exchange of rides is accompanied with an exchange of money through the system. Since the objective of the system from implementing the exchange mechanism is to increase the total number of matched riders, only riders for whom an alternative itinerary is available will receive a proposal to sell their current itineraries.
There are, admittedly, considerable regulatory obstacles to overcome for such P2P exchange or trade schemes to be used in transportation systems. The legal battles faced by ridesourcing firms are now well-known. Transportation supply being considered a public good, any breaking of the traditional FCFS operational paradigms also could face objections based on socio-political arguments of inequity across users. While important, such topics are considered beyond the scope of this paper that focuses only on showing the performance potential of the proposed scheme.

Abstract


Electric vehicles (EVs) are energy efficient and often presented as a zero-emission transport mode to achieve long-term decarbonization visions in the transport sector. The implementation of a sustainable transportation environment through EV utilization, however, requires the addressing of certain cost and environmental concerns such as limited driving range and battery-charging issues before its full potential can be realized. Nevertheless, a specific type of use of EVs, namely in taxi services, may elicit positive public opinion, as it promises a commitment toward sustainability in urban life. In light of this, this study proposes an integrated approach that combines EV operation with a conceptual design for shared-ride taxi services. As some productivity loss may be naturally expected due to the time spent in charging, it is important to look at whether such performance loss from the passenger and system standpoints can be offset with ingenuity in operational design. In this study, an EV taxi charge-replenishing scheme that can be coupled with a real-time taxi-dispatch algorithm is designed. Sustainable Urban Mobility: the proposed EV charging schemes for taxi services are studied via simulations and the effects of the limited driving range and battery-charging details are examined from a system performance viewpoint. The simulation study also reveals illustrative results on the impact of the EV taxi fleet’s operation on the charging system. Next, a real-time shared-taxi operation scheme that allows ride sharing with other passengers is proposed to maximize the operational efficiency. The simulation results suggest that the shared-taxi concept can be a viable option to improve on the limitations caused by EV operation. In addition, the importance of projected charging demands and queue delays at different charging locations are also addressed. Some limitations and a future research agenda are also discussed.




1. Introduction – Sustainable Urban Mobility
The transport sector is responsible for about a third of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the USA and a fifth of worldwide GHG emissions (Buehler & Pucher, 2011 Buehler, R., & Pucher, J. (2011). Sustainable transport in Freiburg: Lessons from Germany’s environmental capital. International Journal of Sustainable Transportation, 5, 43–70. Retrieved from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15568311003650531[Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar]; Ogden & Anderson, 2011 Ogden, J., & Anderson, L. (2011). Sustainable transportation energy pathways: A research summary for decision makers. Davis, CA: Regents of the University of California. [Google Scholar]). Naturally, reducing carbon-based vehicle emissions and GHG has been a critical issue because of their serious impact on the environment and human health in many urban areas. Two major approaches to address this have emerged in sustainable transportation research: (1) developing energy-efficient technologies and (2) adopting efficient transportation operations. As part of the energy strategy, auto manufacturers are producing alternative-fuel vehicles (AFV) such as hybrid vehicles (HV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), electric vehicles (EV), and fuel-cell vehicles (FCV) that have zero or significantly reduced vehicle emissions. There is growing interest in EVs because they are considered to be zero-emission vehicles (ZEV) as they use no internal combustion engines (ICE) and are powered by electric motors from battery packs without any local CO and NOx emissions. Nevertheless, other concerns limit EV utilization. These include higher prices of vehicles and cost of the charging infrastructure, shorter driving ranges compared to the range of gasoline vehicles, and the lost productivity when vehicles are idle while battery charging. Even if EVs are not yet considered to be ready to replace ICE vehicles on a large scale, they can certainly be considered as a viable option for many fleet applications that envisage the use of energy-efficient vehicles and require fewer resources to operate than even personal automobiles (Barth & Todd, 2001 Barth, M., & Todd, M. (2001). User behavior evaluation of an intelligent shared electric vehicle system. In Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 1760, 145–152.[CrossRef], [Google Scholar]; Green Car Reports, 2010 Green Car Reports. (2010).

As examples of cities focusing on EV use as a sustainable option, the City of New York has set a goal of having one third of the city’s taxis electric by 2020 (Flegenheimer, 2013 Flegenheimer, M. (2013, April 21). Electic-taxi experiment asks if city’s cabbies can spare the time to plug in. The New York Times. Retrieved from http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/nyregion/electric-taxi-experiment-to-begin-in-new-york.html?_r=2& [Google Scholar]) and the Seoul Metropolitan Government in Korea has unveiled its Electric Vehicle Delivery Plan for Seoul, which has set 72,000 EV and hybrid taxicabs as the green car provision target in the near future (Energy Smart Communities Initiative, 2011 Energy Smart Communities Initiative. (2011). Electric vehicle delivery plan for Seoul. Retrieved from http://esci-ksp.org/?project=electric-vehicle-delivery-plan-for-seoul [Google Scholar]). It is true that such electric taxi programs will be a great opportunity to improve sustainable air quality and energy consumption. However, the deployment of commercial EV fleets can raise concerns related to the complexity of the taxi industry and charging infrastructures. According to a recent study on the EV taxi pilot program by the Taxi and Limousine Commission in New York City (2013 Flegenheimer, M. (2013, April 21). Electic-taxi experiment asks if city’s cabbies can spare the time to plug in. The New York Times. Retrieved from http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/nyregion/electric-taxi-experiment-to-begin-in-new-york.html?_r=2& [Google Scholar]), taxi drivers will require 45 to 90 min of charging during their daily service time, which is a critical loss in such commercial vehicle operations. Not being able to operate during charging breaks causes obvious revenue loss. Moreover, the shortage of vehicles at peak service times can decrease service quality because of the lower service acceptance rate. In the New York City pilot program, drivers are given certain privileges to turn down passengers based on their destinations to relieve concerns about the battery losing charge in the midst of their trips, and this causes a further loss of revenue. Clearly, the success of EV taxis requires efficient operations as well as fuel-efficient vehicles. Alternatives such as the e-hailing system suggested by the study (New York City, 2013) can help increase system efficiency through a reduction of cruising time, but such options might not be addressing the operations from a fundamental perspective. These potential issues motivate the authors to study potential EV taxi operation with a ride-sharing scheme.
As the traditional transportation system designs may render these limitations of EVs prohibitive, it becomes important to consider if newer paradigms of shared-ride operation can help offset it. The reasons to consider taxis with such shared-ride operations are as follows. First, taxi is certainly the most popular on-demand dial-a-ride system in many urban areas of the world. Second, typically short taxi trips within smaller areas are particularly suitable when EV driving range is an issue. Finally, due to substantial driving without passengers and fewer average number of riders than even private vehicles, taxis are more polluting than private autos (on a per-trip-distance basis), and thus replacing them with EVs is attractive. It is indeed easier, however, to improve this using better ride sharing, unlike with private auto use. Despite the cost of initial investment, utilizing EVs for taxi may prove to be an ideal application in terms of reducing emissions and fuel costs as shown in the 1-year EV taxi pilot program in China (New York Daily News, 2011).
In general, employing real-time ride sharing can be a great option to maximize the conventional taxi and paratransit operations. Such a concept dynamically utilizes the empty seats by assigning passengers on demand, which is quite different from the early version of carpooling projects that were not feasible for real-time response due to the lack of advanced information technologies. For instance, newer designs of sustainable demand-responsive transit (DRT) have been introduced in recent years because the provision of traditional public transport services for medium or lower demands has always been criticized for its operational inefficiency (Dial, 1995 Dial, R. B. (1995). Autonomous dial-a-ride transit introductory overview. Transportation Research, 3C (5), 261–275.[CrossRef], [Google Scholar]; Cortés & Jayakrishnan, 2002 Cortés, C. E., & Jayakrishnan, R. (2002). Design and operational concepts of high-coverage point-to-point transit system. In Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 1783, 178–187.[CrossRef], [Google Scholar]; Quadrifoglio, 2007). At the same time there are also commercial enterprises proving that newer concepts for smaller vehicles, such as private cars and taxicabs, can indeed be introduced. For instance, Zimride and Carma are services recently initiated in the United States in the private sector, which facilitate ride sharing in private cars by simply matching drivers and riders in real time for passenger travel in urban areas. These services utilize vehicles operated by regular car owners and not commercial drivers. Similarly, real-time shared-taxi operations can also potentially show efficiency improvements.
Shared-taxi service can be characterized as an on-demand ride-share service operated by an online dispatch center such that the system is capable of taking service requests from individual customers in real time and establishing service vehicle schedules. Even though taxi sharing is prohibited by law in many cities in the United States, these services are being initiated in many countries. In China, the Beijing government recently allowed taxi sharing because of the shortage of taxicabs during rush hours. In Taiwan and Japan, shared-taxi services are conducted or have been initiated to link passengers dynamically (Tao, 2007 Tao, C. C. (2007).

SAE International Journal of Alternative Powertrains, 1, 27–33.[CrossRef], [Google Scholar]) conducted a survey study that collected data on the charging behavior of 2,903 private EV owners (e.g., Nissan LEAF and Chevrolet Volt) in the United States. They analyzed the EV charging patterns and locations and showed that the state of charge (SOC) of the battery at the start of charging events of private EV drivers was mostly distributed between 20% and 80%. Li and Zhang (2012 Li, G., & Zhang, X.-P. (2012). Modeling of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle charging demand in probabilistic power flow calculations. IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 3, 492–499.[CrossRef], [Web of Science ®]
, [Google Scholar]) proposed a methodology of modeling the overall charging demand of PHEVs for a local residential community. The study assumed various key factors that determine the charging behavior and carried out Monte Carlo simulations. The location selection model for EV charging stations by Giménez-Gaydou et al. (2015) used a gradual maximal covering model based on daily charging needs, charging coverage, and adoption potential. They used socioeconomic characteristics and drivers’ activity patterns for charging demand estimation. Ghamami et al. (2016 Ghamami, M., Nie, Y., & Zockaie, A. (2016). Planning charging infrastructure for plug-in electric vehicles in city centers. International Journal of Sustainable Transportation, 10, 343–353.[Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar]) considered existing parking lots in city centers as candidate locations for PHEV charging by assuming that the charging demands can be estimated by office buildings near the city parking lots.
Commercial EV fleet operations have a set of unique characteristics that are not sufficiently addressed by the studies in the literature. For instance, the cost of recharging time for fleet vehicles is quite different from what is incurred by private drivers who can recharge when they return home for the night. Additional costs are involved to set up the charging infrastructure, such as EV charging locations for the fleet and allocating optimal number of chargers. The main factors in determining how often and where vehicles will need to charge cannot be simply estimated on the basis of vehicle mile traveled (VMT) by the EV fleet. Instead, exploring EV charging profiles in spatial and temporal scopes will be required to find out optimal strategies for EV fleet operations and allocating charging resources. There has not been much focus on how the EV fleet characteristics influence the charging behavior, thereby impacting the operational performance of the fleet and the charging infrastructure. Furthermore, there has been no consideration of flexible transportation solutions that may be particularly applicable for larger use of EVs than the limited fleet contexts discussed so far.
Investigating EV charging patterns in conjunction with shared-ride systems requires simulation modeling and analysis due to its complexity and nonlinear system performance. A recent simulation study conducted by Jung and Jayakrishnan (2012 Jung, J., & Jayakrishnan, R. (2012). High-coverage point-to-point transit: Electric vehicle operations. In Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 2287, 44–53.[CrossRef], [Google Scholar]) is an example of larger scale EV fleet application for DRT. The study assumed an innovative transportation alternative (Cortés & Jayakrishnan, 2002 Cortés, C. E., & Jayakrishnan, R. (2002). Design and operational concepts of high-coverage point-to-point transit system. In Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 1783, 178–187.[CrossRef], [Google Scholar]) called high coverage point-to-point transit (HCPPT), which involves a sufficient number of deployed small vehicles for point-to-point passenger travel services with associated hub terminals for passenger transfers. However, this study mainly focused on the HCPPT-style design for EV operation rather than on investigating the general impact of vehicle charging. In this study, we describe an approach to simulate EV fleet charging profiles that employ an EV taxi-charging scheme and investigate the impact of the scheme on the system-level performance of taxi services. The main objectives of this article are to model a case of a large fleet of vehicles providing shared rides in a real-time demand-responsive manner and to discuss the specific issues that may affect the feasibility of the implementation of EV fleets for such taxi services. This article makes the following contributions:


We develop a detailed simulation framework that can efficiently incorporate an EV-charging scheme with a real-time taxi-dispatch algorithm. The charging scheme includes the aspects necessary to model the expected inefficiency of EVs and identify charging demand characteristics.


A series of simulation runs is performed with a fleet of 600 EV taxicabs on a network in Seoul, South Korea, that spans 605 km2 (233 mi2) and has 22 candidate refueling locations. The simulations focus on investigating the effects of the limited driving ranges, battery replenishing times, and initial states of battery on passenger delivery and peak charging demand.


We suggest a shared-taxi strategy that improves the productivity loss that can be caused by an EV charging break. By introducing various levels of shared-taxi operation parameters, it achieves better performance in passenger delivery despite the critical limitations of EV fleets such as short driving ranges and regular charging breaks.


Finally, our simulation study examines vehicle queue delays when the number of chargers is limited at each location. The simulation results provide specific insights into queue lengths, which can be the foundation for an optimal charger allocation model.


In the next section, we propose an EV-charging scheme for taxi service. Then, detailed simulation assumptions and scenarios are introduced in the subsequent section. Finally, we discuss the simulation results in terms of recharging demands, system performance, quality of service, and queue delay.

Fast Company writes that the plans are predicted to lead to significant savings on things like fuels, as India looks towards changes in motoring activities, as well as building cities which revolve around their inhabitants, rather than cars.
And these new proposals could potentially cut projected vehicle growth from 170 million cars to just 77 million in 2030, as well as net over $60 billion savings on fuel costs in the same year. Only 18 people in 1000 currently own their own car in India, the rest simply haven’t been able to afford it. But as the nation’s economy continues to grow it is predicted that this will change dramatically and that has prompted the government to act.

Indian cities already experience high levels of congestion and pollution, despite car ownership currently being relatively low. In fact, 10 Indian cities are in the WHO’s list of the 20 most-polluted on the planet. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s 2016 report, Circular economy in India: Rethinking growth for long-term prosperity, found that a circular economy development path for mobility and vehicle manufacturing could create additional annual benefits of ₹31 lakh crore (US$ 482 billion) in 2050, compared with business as usual.
The legislators in India are looking to capitalise on the fact that so few people own a car. It will be much easier to initiate a trend of electric cars in a population where cars are so infrequent, because fewer existing vehicles will need to be replaced. Car-sharing is already on the rise, and there are opportunities to couple that with better public transport and bicycle infrastructure. India have an advantage over many countries in that they are changing before their industries have become too big to make it a possibility.

 Four cycling enthusiasts are set to launch a new bike-sharing mobile application, challenging the ­status of Gobee.bike – the city’s first and only service – by ­promising cheaper charges and designated parking spaces. To test the popularity of the new biking trend, which has taken the mainland by storm, the new ­players launched a crowd-funding campaign on online platform Kickstarter last week. One of the founders, Bryan Au Chi-tong, said the team would start talking to district councillors in the next few weeks, and promised a better parking system with a new technology provided by one of the biggest mainland bike-sharing operators.








Au, 55, a veteran rider who worked in Guangzhou for more than a decade, said he was “disappointed” by negative media reports when Gobee.bike launched its services in April, especially with the complaints over the haphazard parking of bicycles.



District councillors over the past month received reports of many bikes left randomly in ­public car park spaces. Au said the problem could be easily solved with a new technology called “virtual parking space” used by many mainland operators, which requires riders to return bikes to designated parking zones.
If the bikes are not detected by signals in the spaces, the charging metre will not stop.
The practice could avoid disruptions caused by randomly parked bikes in public areas, and also facilitate better management by operators and regulators.
Chinese bike-sharing start-up says it’s now worth more than US$2 billion
Au claimed that a bike-sharing operator in Guangzhou with 300,000 users had agreed to sell the parking technology to his start-up group.
Au said he had earlier spoken to Gobee’s founder, Raphael Cohen, about a potential technological cooperation, but his offer had been declined.
This prompted Au and three of his local cycling friends to start their own brand.
He aims to distribute 20,000 shared bikes in the city – on par with Gobee’s goal – if the crowd-funding results show “great interest” from Hongkongers.
The campaign’s target is to raise HK$3.8 million from 38,000 backers – each contributing HK$100.
But Au said the partners would go ahead with their own savings even if they failed to reach the mark.
“Money is not a problem. The most important thing is whether Hong Kong people support bike-sharing,” he said, adding that the crowd-funding bid served more as a market test.
He estimated HK$3 million would be enough to support rolling out the service in five districts, each with 50 to 100 bikes.
Au said he also planned to charge only HK$1 per hour to ­encourage Hongkongers to use bikes for their daily commutes. Gobee bike charges HK$5 per half hour.
“We don’t expect to earn a lot of money charging HK$1 per hour,” Au said. He said their goal was to turn Hong Kong into a more bike-friendly city.

Consumer adoption of peer-to-peer and ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft points toward a generational sea change in how consumers and businesses view transportation. These changing behaviors are combining with rising urbanization, pervasive high-speed mobile broadband, and rapid technological leaps in computing power and data center capacity to enable these new business models to drive and accelerate the development and use of autonomous mobility solutions.
Ironically, carmakers have turned to offering these same car-sharing and ad hoc use applications to drive up utilization rates. The global nature and scale of this change has major implications for the adoption and use of autonomous “Mobility-as-a-Service” among consumers and businesses alike. “Being driven” by intelligent, pilotless vehicles will represent the essential nature of future transportation.
Strategy Analytics expects that, as we move toward SAE level five vehicle autonomy, these mega trends will combine and enable Mobility-as-a-Service to open the door to an emerging new market that we refer to as the “Passenger Economy.” This Passenger Economy represents the value of the products and services derived from the use of fully autonomous, pilotless vehicles, including the indirect savings in both time and resources generated by the use of pilotless vehicles.
Intel, seeking to enable the computing and connectivity technologies that will drive this market, has engaged Strategy Analytics as a partner in the preparation of this report to validate the hypothesis that this Passenger Economy is on the horizon and that it holds massive economic potential. In assessing this opportunity, Strategy Analytics and Intel aim to start a conversation that explores the catalysts for change, frames the value or economic opportunity, and begins to build use cases that can enable business decision-makers to explore and develop actionable change strategies.
Passenger Economy opportunity
The Passenger Economy represents a US$7 trillion global opportunity in 2050. The Passenger Economy will stimulate value creation from the adoption of Mobility-as-a-Service and other new mobility services as well as emerging new applications and services as well as from savings in time and money associated with vehicle use and from the resulting freedom of movement.
Our research finds that autonomous driving technology will enable a new Passenger Economy worth US$7 trillion in 2050. It will drive change across a range of industries, displacing vehicle ownership with Mobility-as-aService, and defining a new landscape of concierge and ride-hailing services, as well as pilotless vehicle options for businesses in industries like package delivery and long-haul transportation.
Consumer use of a range of Mobility-as-a-Service offerings will account for US$3.7 trillion, nearly 55 percent of all revenues. The evolution and mass adoption of Mobility-as-a-Service by consumers is central to the emergence of the Passenger Economy. Consumers will continue to forgo ownership as they seek out economical, self-directed personal mobility. The range of Mobility-as-a-Service offerings will explode as autonomously operated vehicles become ubiquitous and personalized services emerge.
Business use of Mobility-as-a-Service will generate US$3 trillion in revenues, roughly 43 percent of total revenues. Industries like transportation and freight delivery and sales and service fleets will utilize pilotless vehicle technology to reshape their fundamental businesses and to leverage new opportunities.
New emerging applications and services will account for US$203 billion of revenues. These revenues will be generated from the use of a range of new use cases for pilotless vehicles in industries like hotel and hospitality, restaurant and dining, tourism and entertainment, healthcare, and service delivery of all kinds.
In terms of the other economic and social impacts of the Passenger Economy Strategy Analytics expects that conservatively, 585,000 lives can be saved due to pilotless vehicles in the era of the Passenger Economy from 2035 to 2045. This is nearly as many people that live in the city of Dusseldorf, and would fill the Melbourne Cricket Grounds nearly six times over.
Pilotless vehicles will free more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world.  Reductions in public safety costs related to traffic accidents will amount to more than US$234 billion over the Passenger Economy era from 2035-2045.
Pilotless vehicles will converge
The onset of autonomous pilotless vehicles will converge with a number of important changes in consumer behavior that will combine to underpin the emerging Passenger Economy. We are seeing today the first green shoots of these growing shifts in consumer behavior. These changes are the leading edge of this opportunity and will be driven by several market forces we see emerging today.
Mobile “Connectedness”: Mobile connectivity has reached nearly every consumer demographic and geographic nexus on the planet and continues to be found in an expanding number and variety of connected devices, automobiles and machines.
By 2050, nearly two-thirds of the global population will live in urban environments . A key factor driving this trend is the desire to be closer to work and leisure. As population density rises in cities, so too will the cost of living. People will flock to suburbs further from the city center to compensate, driving commute times higher and outstripping the ability of public transport infrastructure to fully meet consumer mobility needs.
Vehicle-Sharing and the Rise of Transportation Networks – Mobility-as-a-Service: Ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Lyft are pursuing pilotless fleets with the ultimate goal of obviating the need for drivers and converting what is currently a taxi alternative into, in essence, a public transportation network of shared vehicles comprising a range of vehicle types. The transportation environment will be increasingly dominated by Uber, Lyft, Zipcar and a host of other ride-hailing and car-sharing services that are already driving down owned-vehicle usage in some metropolitan areas. The global nature and scale of this change has major implications for the long-run potential for the Passenger Economy.
Mobility-as-a-Service represents the value that will be created by the shift in transportation expenditures by consumers and business from vehicle ownership, taxi use, rental car use and public transport to the use of thirdparty transportation services based on autonomous vehicles. Mobility-as-a-Service solutions will represent the essential nature of future transportation and open the door to the passenger economy of the future.
Traffic congestion, pollution and safety are significant issues for every city in the world. Congestion is bad in emerging and mature markets alike. City governments in Nairobi, Kenya; Delhi, India; Istanbul, Turkey; and São Paulo, Brazil report that congestion is costing residents and businesses in each city millions of dollars per day in productivity. The World Bank estimates that over 1.3 million people die in traffic accidents each year. Over 90 percent of those deaths are in emerging markets.
To combat this, local, state and federal governments have their collective thumbs on the scale influencing transportation decision-making through the increased application of tolling and road-use charging and restricting cars from driving on particular streets and neighborhoods either for specified time periods or completely.
Major metropolitan areas including Stockholm, London, Singapore, Paris and Hamburg are restricting areas from vehicle traffic, taxing private vehicle owners for driving into the city center, or otherwise discouraging or forbidding the use of vehicles within city limits.
The pressures of mounting traffic congestion and the correlated emissions will drive regulators to include pilotless vehicles as a part of their larger public transportation networks of trains, trams, subways, busses or automated vehicles.
In the future, public officials and city planners will treat transportation in the same manner as they treat real estate – allocating transportation resources for commercial and personal applications varying by type and time of day and dynamically allocating those resources to suit varying requirements. Some cities may choose to own the vehicle networks not unlike existing public transportation.
Valuing the Passenger Economy
The Passenger Economy represents a global US$7 trillion opportunity in 2050. Autonomous driving (AD) technology will enable a new global Passenger Economy worth US$7 trillion annually in 2050.This economy enabled by autonomous vehicles will drive change across a range of industries, displacing vehicle ownership with Mobility-as-a-Service offerings and defining a new landscape of concierge and taxi services, as well as pilotless vehicle services for businesses in industries like package delivery and long-haul transportation.
In general, consumer and business use of Mobility-as-a-Service propositions are expected to deliver the greatest value since they involve shifts away from vehicle ownership. This is the direct effect of autonomous vehicles converting drivers to passengers. Businesses will be a significant driver of autonomous vehicle sales in the early commercial stages of pilotless vehicle sales.
Consumer use of Mobility-as-a-Service offerings will account for nearly 55 percent of these revenues, or US$3.7 trillion. The evolution and mass adoption of Mobility-as-a-Service by consumers is central to the emergence of the Passenger Economy. This is the disruption of the one-to-one coupling of car ownership and personal mobility. Consumers will continue to forgo ownership as they seek out economical, self-directed personal mobility. The range of Mobility-as-a-Service offerings will explode as autonomously operated vehicles become ubiquitous and instantaneously personalized services emerge. Peer-topeer and networked ride-sharing models of today will be largely displaced by mobility service providers offering mobility for uses ranging from work-related applications or simply enabling movement around urban or suburban areas.
Mobility-as-a-Service
Business use of Mobility-as-a-Service will generate US$3 trillion in revenues in industries like transportation and freight delivery, sales and service fleets, and a range of medium- and heavy-duty applications in industrial, mining and agriculture, and other production-centric and consumer goods industries. The adoption and use of Mobility-as-a-Service within the transportation industry will be a strong driver of autonomous vehicle and truck sales in the early years of the Passenger Economy.
Businesses will make use of light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks for transportation, delivery, sales and service fleets, and other business class transport vehicles within Mobility-as-a-Service models and other new mobility services. In the transportation market, the impact of these services will be global as it will relieve long-haul driver shortages around the world. Developed markets will drive the early adoption of these services, accounting for two-thirds of these revenues initially.
US$200 billion in revenues will be generated from rising consumer use of new, innovative applications and services that will emerge as pilotless vehicle services expand and evolve. As commercialization gains steam in 2040-2050, consumers will generate an increasingly large share of value in the Passenger Economy from their adoption and use of innovative new applications and uses cases in a range of service businesses ranging from dining to medical to entertainment.
They may involve shifts in business models to more usage based service revenues or to location based services where the service comes to the passenger rather than the passenger going to a specific vendor location. This is already emerging today in the decline of shopping malls as “destinations.”
When we assess the impact of the Passenger Economy on a regional basis, it is our view that developed markets will account for nearly three-quarters of these revenues in the early commercialization stages of pilotless vehicles. In emerging markets, vehicle ownership trends and a lack of infrastructure will throttle early adoption, but regulators’ long-term needs to combat congestion, pollution and safety issues in densely populated cities in this region will also fuel growth.
As the market ramps in 2050, emerging markets come to account for larger share of the total. Our estimated allocation of the global US$7 trillion in revenues in 2050 by region is provided below.
It is important to remember that the use of pilotless vehicles requires a significant paradigm shift on the part of consumers in terms of their perceptions of safety and reliability of the vehicles themselves. The use of pilotless vehicles will also require a major change in consumer views toward vehicle ownership (which are already underway) and a significant change of behaviors toward wider use of Mobility-as-a-Service offerings.
The technology to deliver fully autonomous vehicles is developing rapidly but is still a number of years away. And the regulatory and potential infrastructure changes required will happen over the next several generations instead of the next few years.
As these forces collide and evolve over time, they combine to create a “long tail” of services adoption as the early sales of level five pilotless vehicles ramps through 2035. The early opportunity is still significant as momentum builds for early service offerings in the 2030 to 2035 time period, when we estimate the cumulative revenues for the period can reach toward US$800 billion.

New Delhi: Delhi based shared mobility platform Revv, has launched a new initative called SWITCH which will allow users subscribe to a curated fleet of cars, by-the-month or by-the-year. Revv claims that this is the first ever, multi-brand car subscription platform in Asia, and is essentially an attempt to re-imagine the 100-year old practice of car ownership.
Revv raised its Series A round of funding in November 2016 from Edelweiss Private Equity, and since then, have added Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Jaipur and Vishakapatnam to their geographical footprint.
Speaking at the launch, co-founders of Revv said, “Mainstream adoption of shared mobility will increasingly depend upon an ecosystem of services coming together, which collectively cater to the full set of needs of a person who wants to adopt a lifestyle based on shared mobility v/s traditional car ownership. While some use-cases have been increasingly well-served by cabs and hourly self-drive rentals, there is a clear gap in services tailored towards longer term mobility.”
“For users with fast-changing lifestyles, or for users with tactical requirements (say, for a few months), buying or leasing a car is impractical, because of the long-term commitments and hassles involved in purchase, maintenance and resale. Switch aims to change that and fill this gap.”
Revv says that it is a subscription service, available by-the-month or by-the-year. This is an attempt to make accessing a car much more convenient and hassle-free..
“He can switch between car models as frequently as every month, e.g. using a hatchback for day-to-day usage, while switching to a nice SUV for vacations. He can even maintain his subscription across cities. The upfront expense will also be much lower than buying a car because of no down-payment.” the statement added
“Sharing a subscription is more practical than sharing one’s own car, and we see strong potential in that. For the Phase 2 of this, we will develop an app to help a user share his car with friends/neighbours when not in use, to substantially reduce his monthly expenses.”
The fleet will include a wide range of models, including MUVs, SUVs, cross-overs, sedans and hatchbacks.
Having nearly tripled its fleet and geographical presence in the last five months, Revv now intends to expand its product portfolio to address needs and use cases of shared mobility that are not being addressed by any other available products.

Abstract
Corporate carsharing – Schedule Optimization: Sharing electric vehicles among companies and users can increase efficiency of corporate car fleets. Due to charging times and limited ranges, high quality scheduling is necessary to achieve a high degree of utilization and in turn economic efficiency. Schedule optimization can help improving a schedule regarding utilization and cost, but does not take into account possible future bookings. If a schedule is fragmented, no future bookings can fit in. In this work, we introduce a measurement for the fragmentation of schedules and use it to minimize fragmentation and in turn maximize future booking potential. We evaluate the approach using synthetic and real-life trials, showing that fragmentation reduction can lead to increased utilization in electric vehicle fleets.
Introduction
Corporate carsharing: even though electric vehicles (EVs) have been available for some time, recent developments like the rising costs of fossil fuels, technological progress in vehicle technology and availability of regenerative energy make the economic use of EVs in company car fleets more and more feasible. The market potential is noticeable, estimated at about 1 million EVs until 2020 just for Germany and in particular for company car fleets at 30% of newly bought cars. The drawbacks of EVs, such as the high fixed cost for vehicles and charging infrastructures, have to be overcome by employing high utilization. The Shared E-Fleet project researches the economic operation of shared car fleets, making it possible even for small and medium enterprises, which could not economically operate a fleet on their own. Charging times and limited range are special challenges in the context of using EVs for corporate car sharing, which need to be taken into consideration when scheduling vehicles and business trips. When operating at capacity, the consequences of minor disruptions like delays or lost battery level can affect the future schedule, as trips might not be started on time or without sufficient charge to reach the destination. To reach high utilization of car fleets while minimizing cost or ecological impact and compensating these disruptions, continuous optimization of the schedule is used. While regular optimization techniques can be used to optimize a fleet schedule, e.g., regarding minimization of emissions, possible future states are not taken into account. These include the potential for future bookings, for which suitable timeslots in the schedule need to be available. If the schedule is fragmented, i.e., trips are distributed uniformly among vehicles, there may be no timeslot for a future booking, even though in aggregate, enough unused time on vehicles is available. In this work, we describe a rating method for vehicle schedules based on a fragmentation criterion and use it to provide optimized schedules with minimum fragmentation, thus ensuring maximum opportunities for future bookings. The contribution of this work is as follows: We introduce a fragmentation ratio, a measurement for the fragmentation of schedules and show how it is used as part of a closed loop optimization system.

Mahindra Electric, the manufacture of electric vehicles (EV) and a part of Mahindra Group, has laid out a growth plan for its electric vehicles business by unveiling a comprehensive technology and product roadmap, leading to the next generation of electric vehicles, which the company internally refers to as EV 2.0.
 
With increasing concerns over clean air, urban congestion and rising fuel import bills, electric mobility is set to become mainstream. The Government of India recognises this fact and is actively pursuing rapid adoption of electric vehicles, for private as well as public – shared mobility.
 
Recognising this fact, Mahindra Electric now offers a range of EVs, suitable for personal as well as shared and last mile connectivity. At the same time, the company is investing in next generation EV technology solutions which will deliver longer range, higher speeds and the next generation of connected car technologies.



 
Further, Mahindra is actively engaging with the ecosystem stakeholders, both private and public to drive faster adoption of electric vehicles. This includes setting up of charging infrastructure and fleet operations, delivering mobility as service. The connected car solution that is already rolled out will serve as the building block for smart mobility in the smart cities, which are currently under development.
 
“The time has now arrived for EVs to become mainstream and Mahindra has the right technology and products for India. We will actively engage with the Government, both at the centre and the state, municipal bodies and other private players for setting up a robust EV ecosystem. We are also ramping up our investments towards developing the next generation of EV technologies and products that will cater to the smart cities of tomorrow,” said Dr Pawan Goenka, managing director, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd & chairman, Mahindra Electric.













 
According to Mahesh Babu, CEO, Mahindra Electric, the company’s focus goes beyond just developing electric vehicles as it strives towards investing in next generation technology solutions and globally competitive products, to drive faster adoption of electric vehicles. “With EV 2.0 we have laid out a clear roadmap for electric mobility in India, at par with our global counterparts and are future ready to set out for the next phase of our EV journey,” he added.
 
EV 2.0 will see the company make investments to ramp up manufacturing and charging infrastructure and to develop new, high-end electric powertrains, motor controllers, systems integration and battery technology.
 
Mahindra has been the pioneer of electric vehicle technology in India with its products embodying Mahindra’s vision of the ‘Future of Mobility’ which includes the framework of green, connected, convenient and cost effective vehicle technology. The company made its first serious bet on electric vehicles when it acquired the Bengaluru based Reva Electric Car Company in 2010.
 
Earlier this year, Mahindra Electric adopted a more aggressive stance in electric mobility when it moved from being an electric vehicle manufacturer to a provider of next generation mobility solutions. In line with this, the company also underwent a change in nomenclature to Mahindra Electric Mobility Limited.
 
Today, there are over 2,700 electric vehicles on road from the Mahindra stable, which have clocked more than 40 million km.

Shared-use Mobility: today, we start we a new series of article on shared-use mobility. In the following articles, we will analyze each of the transportation services that are shared among users. Today, we analyze the meaning of shared-use mobility, the present situation and some speculations about future technologies.
Shared-use mobility is a term used to describe transportation services that are shared among users, including public transit; taxis and limos; bikesharing; carsharing (round-trip, one-way, and personal vehicle sharing); ridesharing (car-pooling, van-pooling); ridesourcing/ride-splitting; scooter sharing; shuttle services; neighborhood jitneys; and commercial delivery vehicles providing flexible goods movement.
Shared-use mobility sits within the broader phenomenon that has been termed the ‘Sharing Economy’, in which widespread usage of emerging information and communications technology (ICT), particularly smartphones, enables new forms of market interactions that can enable both new services and improved efficiency in asset utilization. Rather than individual physical items being purchased, owned, controlled, maintained and used solely by their owner, in shared-mobility systems the physical assets (bicycles, automobiles, small aircraft, etc.) are accessed sequentially by multiple users on a pay-per-use basis. This implies higher utilization rates of assets with relatively high fixed costs; in the case of automobiles the classical high fixed cost/low marginal cost paradigm of private car ownership is reversed.
Whereas shared-mobility was a niche market a decade ago, today the phenomenon has entered the mainstream, with a broad array of major automakers investing in shared-mobility services.
In fact, the UN reported in 2015 (UN World Population prospects) that migration patterns and population growth have created an equal split between inhabitants of cities and rural areas for the first time in human history. 
This general trend will continue for the next several decades and will produce a very urbanized world. The continued use of personal transportation model is simply unsustainable given the combination of energy inefficiency, environmental consequences of fossil-fuel usage, potential disruptions to fuel supplies, urban sprawl created by automobile reliance, and congestion caused by inadequate alternative modes of transport. What people need is to radically rethink the problem by examining not only the automobile itself, but also how it is used in cities (where most are currently living), including: 1. size and weight, 2. range and speed, 3. gasoline versus electric, 4. driver-controlled versus autonomous driving, and 5. private versus shared ownership.
Shared-use mobility services are probably the best solution to alleviate the problem. In fact, shared-use mobility services can: reduce traffic congestion, mitigate various forms of pollution, reduce fossil fuel consumption, and improve efficiency of transportation means. This is the reason why technology is advancing quickly and will advance more and more in the future.
Many shared-use vehicles service providers today include some degree of advanced technologies (online reservations, vehicle tracking, smart card access) in their operations. Currently, there is a developing need for interoperability among shared-use vehicle service providers (e.g., smart card access among carsharing organizations) and transit operators (e.g., transit fare collection via smart cards). Interoperability will likely result in higher customer satisfaction and use, leading to greater market penetration. Similarly, some standardization will likely unfold for overall operational techniques (online reservations and insurance policies), customer interactions, and to some degree vehicle interfaces. Because shared-use vehicle systems are still a relatively new mobility concept, an industrywide standardization approach is still premature. Nevertheless, there are attempts to identify many of the important issues that will play a significant role in the interoperability discussions among shared-use vehicle providers and the development of industry standards in the future. There are key elements in intelligent shared-use vehicle system operations and trade-offs encountered during the pioneering stage of shared-use vehicle system developments.

The meaning of Corporate Car Sharing is simple and straightforward: placing a dedicated fleet of vehicles at company premises for the shared use among its employees.
Corporate Car Sharing allows the Companies to optimize their fleet management and significantly reduce fleet-related costs over the long term. It also allows to offer to their employees an attractive mobility solution. Thus, employees are always mobile even if they don’t have a company car, and they don’t have to use rental cars or public transportation for business trips. In this way your employees can save not only on costs but also on time.
If you’re a company that needs to make your employees travel in a safe, efficient and sustainable way, you can choose an innovative technology solution.
Benefits are both for the company and for employees by generating real savings and by giving each participant the freedom to choose a car that suits its general and specific mobility needs.
From the company standpoint, a Corporate Car Sharing Solution can:

Reduce the Total Cost of Mobility and the use of extra-fleet vehicles (taxi, car rental…) so that all vehicles are always deployed with maximum rotation;
Optimize the use of the company parking;
Save in time and resources with Advanced Vehicle Management with customizable rules, detailed analytic information, easy reporting and costs center allocation;
Generate new income by assigning cars to employees while off-work or share them with other parties (car hirers, other…);
Represent, sponsor and support the technologies company solutions to promote innovation, not only to the clients but also towards the employees to build brand belonging and Corporate Social Responsibility awareness;
Increase Corporate Social Responsibility for a sustainable shared travel to decrease car renting burdens, reduce carbon footprint, increase talent recruitment and retention rates.

For the benefit of employees, a Corporate Car sharing Solution will:

Generate time saving while maximizing efficiency;
Have an additional chance of use for personal purposes.

At a corporate level, the company can have the freedom to share its vehicles to employees for professional or private use as well.
The employees can book the car for professional use when they have client visits or are visiting the office from another location or they can book the car for personal use during the weekends or outside working hours for leisure activities. Furthermore, employees can choose to share their own vehicle to other colleagues, either for professional use or even for private use.
Corporate Car Sharing is introducing a whole new kind of business mobility and many companies over the world have already chosen to adopt this solution to save the cost for their employees’ car and taxi work travel.

India could save up to Rs 3.9 lakh crore ($60 billion) in 2030, if the country switches to greener mobility solutions such as public transport, electric vehicles and car-pooling, according to a report by government think tank NITI Aayog.
“India’s current mobility system reflects many of the underlying properties of the emerging mobility paradigm. India could leapfrog the conventional mobility model and achieve a shared, electric and connected mobility future by capitalising on these existing conditions and building on foundational government programmes and policies,” the report “India leaps ahead: Transformative mobility solutions for all” released on Friday said.
The report is based on a workshop convened by NITI Aayog and a US-based think tank Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) in February when 75 executives from public and private sectors discussed ways to decongest the present public mobility by designing a sustainable model for the next 15 years.
It said India could save 64% energy in 2030 by shifting to shared electric mobility. The subsequent drop in petrol and diesel consumption would be 156 million tonnes of oil equivalent (MTOE) or 1.8 tera watt-hour energy — enough to power 1,796.3 million homes in the country.

Also, by pursuing a future powered by electric mobility, carbon dioxide emissions would drop by 37% in 2030, the report said. It also suggested ways of reducing carbon footprint by measures such as limiting registrations of petrol and diesel vehicles by incorporating a lottery system; a system prevalent in China.
Power minister Piyush Goyal had already announced in April to have an all-electric car fleet in India by 2030. “The idea is that by 2030, not a single petrol or diesel car should be sold in the country,” he had said.
 But the idea of electric vehicles never picked up pace in India, mostly driven by lack of favourable policy and recharging infrastructure, and scepticism about how long would an electric vehicle go on one charge.
Inadequate public transportation facilities in major cities has also prompted more and more private vehicles sales in the country. In FY2017, roughly 17.7million bikes and scooters were sold in India, making it the largest two-wheeler market on the planet. That’s over 48,000 vehicles per day.
With cities growing faster than the infrastructural development, more traffic congestion and subsequent pollution has called for urgent measures like car pooling as mentioned in the Niti Aayog – RMI report.
UberPOOL, a ride-sharing service introduced in 2015 by cab-aggregator Uber in Bengaluru, saved over 32 million vehicle-kilometres, 15 lakh litre of fuel and reduced 35 lakh kg CO2 emissions, the report highlights. The service is now available in major cities across .
The study further recommends policy changes such as “mobility-oriented development” of towns and cities by focussed local civic bodies, introduction of zero-emission vehicle credits to incentivise electric and hybrid-energy mobility, setting up a grid for ubiquitous and affordable EV charging, and encourage makers of battery cell technology and electric mobility ancillary industries.

Car share company Liftshare has won £25,000 of funding to explore initiatives to end rural and social isolation.


The Norfolk-based firm was awarded the funding by innovation company Nesta through their ShareLab Fund project.
The project finances businesses to grow evidence and understanding of how collaborative digital platforms can deliver social impact.
Now Liftshare will work with local community transport (CT) providers throughout Norfolk on their ‘HappyCT’ project.
It aims to find ways to improve on-demand transport options for people suffering from social and rural isolation – and promote available services to potential users.
Last November, Nesta research revealed an untapped market for platforms with a social purpose.
It found that nearly 45 million British adults are not aware of how sharing economy technologies can help them access social support services, or support community causes.
This inspired the company to launch the ShareLab fund. Liftshare is one of eight companies to receive funding for their project.
The HappyCT project will be headed up by Liftshare’s Head of Growth, Paul Gosnell, who is now undertaking the initial research phase.
Mr Gosnell said: “Community Transport is a huge industry but relatively unknown to the people it can help most – the people cut off from society due to lack of or poor transport options.
“Combining support, awareness, and data with technology can help connect people and CT operators which is something myself and Liftshare are passionate about doing.
“Using technology to solve real problems. I encourage all interested parties to get in touch with me to share their ideas and opinions!”
Nesta Innovation Lab executive director Helen Goulden said: “The ideas funded through ShareLab show that the collaborative economy has many practical applications beyond just finding a place to stay or getting a cab ride.
“We see great potential in these innovations to help alleviate some of the pressure on local governments, addressing the real needs of people, families and communities.”

The car has long symbolised and facilitated personal liberation.
But now, congestion, connectivity and climate concerns are denting the popularity of the four-wheeled freedom machine. Frustratingly slow-moving traffic and increasing access restrictions are contributing to drivers rethinking their usage, particularly in urban environments.
In Singapore, São Paulo, London and Los Angeles drivers are exploring faster or more convenient alternatives, sometimes even giving up on cars completely. Pessimists would say it is a daunting scenario for auto brands and one that is compelling the most progressive players in the market to rethink their role in the world.
The reality is more complex and we should not forget pleasurable driving moments that enhance the emotional attachment many drivers still have with their car. To secure a role in the mobility landscape of tomorrow, auto brands need to coexist within the increasingly fluid connectivity and sharing environment. They must seize the moment to position themselves as a strong link in the transportation chain. And they should remember the importance of understanding consumer needs to ensure that the final product appeals strongly to the target audience.
Changing scenario
The most visionary are already doing it, by exploring smarter ways to stay relevant at crucial moments. One way is by partnering with other mobility players to offer innovative car sharing services. We have also seen others investing in e-hailing and P2P car-sharing such as GM with Lyft, Toyota with Uber and Mercedes Benz’s acquisition of Flightcar. Ford has gone a step further and created a separate entity — Ford Smart Mobility — designed to develop mobility services and invest in promising mobility-related ventures, collaborating with start-ups and tech companies.
Working together seems to be an expedient strategy right now, and not just with car-centric partners. Auto brands, public transport networks and technology innovators need to collaborate, integrate and evolve. Consumers tell us that seamless interconnectivity between all these mobility choices is critical.
The best mobility solutions are those, which address needs at the precise moment they are required.
That means having almost instant access to a variety of transportation modes that will efficiently take them from A to B in the most effective and most responsible way. That mindset means virtually every journey is unique, with an almost infinite number of permutations.
Smart mobility
Car brands need to factor themselves into as many of these journey choices as possible leveraging the possibilities of mobility service apps like the FordPass or Daimler’s Moovel. Just as the smartphone integrated lots of services and made them instantly available at our fingertips, smart mobility should focus its revolution through intelligent integration.
People are increasingly using multiple modes of transport, depending on the purpose and destination, so the road ahead for mobility cannot be mapped out by one industry alone.
The environment in which auto manufacturers, airlines, rail networks and public transport providers operate will be shaped by one another, as well as by policymakers, town planners, environmental campaigners and NGOs.
No view of the future can be complete unless it incorporates insights from each of these groups. New business models will be required that encourage partnerships, foster joined up thinking and create opportunities for innovative collaboration. This has already happened to some extent with OEM car-sharing initiatives, but it’s only the tip of the iceberg.
Sustainable success is about delivering the fastest, shortest, most affordable route, and at the same time offering a smooth, seamless and comfortable journey. Privately-owned cars tend to tick the ‘comfort’ box better as maintenance of shared cars can be an issue.
To remain relevant in managing seamless functionality, auto brands must work out how to be a credible option at the crucial moment journey choices are made. This means the smarter conversation is about usage, while still leveraging the brand assets that make people love and own a symbol of freedom. Integration, not domination is the most intelligent strategy, at the moment at least.

For BYD, it is not the first attempt at tapping the EV opportunity in India. The Chinese OEM had introduced the country’s first electric bus for passenger service in 2014, through the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC). It had also tied up with Singapore-based entrepreneur Bhupendra Kumar Modi promoted Smart Group to set up manufacturing electric vehicles in India.
The electric mobility project in Nagpur, the home constituency of Union Minister Nitin Gadkari and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, will see an investment of over Rs 50 crore by Ola. The company will also work on training and educating driver partners on maintenance and use of in-car technology along with its OEM partners.
Speaking at the launch of the pilot project,  chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said, “The state of Maharashtra is geared towards driving positive change for collective improvement of the society we live in, and we welcome and encourage such initiatives. We are extremely proud of the commitment corporations like Ola, Mahindra and others are working towards building sustainable transportation for all. In support of this initiative, we have waived off VAT, road tax, and registration for all electric vehicles in the state, and we look forward to building Maharashtra as a model state for others to emulate in the future.”
Union minister of Road Transport, Highways and Shipping, Nitin Gadkari, who was also present at the launch said, “There is an urgent need to re-think and revisit transport infrastructure and fuel dependency, not just in India, but globally. Large scale adoption of electric vehicles can bring the monumental change that we urgently need, and in this endeavour, we launched the 100% EV nation by 2030 mission. It is heartening to see Indian companies such as Ola and Mahindra taking Government’s vision forward and in building a strong ecosystem for sustainable mobility. I look forward to working with them to make the 2030 vision a reality.” The Union Minister also shared that the government is in talks with Japan’s Softbank, a key stakeholder in Ola, to support the electric mobility drive in India. “We are engaged in initial talks with SoftBank for loans at low interest rate for a green project. We want to introduce two lakh electric buses for public transport,” said Gadkari, as reported by PTI.
“India has the need as well as the potential to set a global example on electric adoption to power its mobility needs. We look forward to working with the government and the various industry partners in building the electric vehicle ecosystem grounds up for India. We believe that Electric Mobility in a multi-modal format, will be key towards realizing our mission of building mobility for a billion Indians,” said Bhavish Aggarwal, co-founder & CEO, Ola.
M&M, currently the only Indian elect car maker, has recently raised its stake in the electric mobility industry with some aggressive plans. Mahindra Electric, the company’s EV arm, has set a target of reducing manufacturing cost of its EVs (excluding battery pack) by 20-25 percent to make EVs affordable for customers and the business viable for the company by 2020. Speaking at the launch of the project in Nagpur, Dr. Pawan Goenka, MD, Mahindra & Mahindra said, “This pilot will pave the wave for wider adoption of electric vehicles. I am confident that India will make a paradigm shift in lifestyles – towards smart mobility and smart cities that are driven by progressive Government policies.”
Sulajja Firodia Motwani, founder & CEO, Kinetic Green Energy & Power Solutions, which manufactures e-rickshaws with lithium-ion batteries said, “These e-rickshaws will play a key part in providing seamless e-mobility at Nagpur, especially for last mile connectivity and for affordable short distance travel.”
NITI Aayog, the government’s policy think-tank is betting on an all-electric car fleet in India by 2030. This pilot project initiated in Nagpur, will not only help the government and OEMs to understand the market but will also give citizens a first-hand experience of EVs and promote its usage.

Abstract
The increasing number of vehicles and drivers have led to a marked increase in travel time expenditure (TTE), congestion, demand for fossil fuels, and adverse environmental impacts. Improving energy efficiency in the transportation sector, public awareness of the behavior of the people vis-à-vis energy efficiency, implementing policies that encourage other modes of transportation (e.g., public transit, ride-sharing, bicycles, and walking, etc.) that decrease vehicle dependency are some effective approaches that mitigate the aforementioned negative effects, which will lead to significant reductions in the total energy consumption. This article investigates the effect of governmental policies on vehicle dependency reduction and the decrease of Travel Time Expenditure by vehicle owners, and propose a novel method to calculate the current and future Travle Time Expendituress by individuals. The effect of demographic variables and the region on vehicle dependency and Travel Time expenditure for students of three of the most populated universities in Malaysia (University of Malaya, University Putra Malaysia, and University Technology Malaysia) were investigated as well. The peoples’ expectations from individual modes of transportation such as cycling and walking were also analyzed. The results showed that all demographic factors, except nationality, affect the levels of vehicle ownership, while income levels and nationality affects Travel Time Expenditure by personal vehicles. The results show that the average Travel Time Expenditure can be reduced by 89% if the recommended infrastructure (e.g., increase bus routes, train routes, train services, frequencies of buses and train, and facilities for cyclists, etc.) is provided. These outcomes can assist policy makers to efficiently manage transportation budgets, and would also help people decrease vehicle usage, which will subsequently decrease their corresponding Travel Time Expenditure and fuel consumption.

Overview of bicycle-sharing schemes
Also called “Public-Use Bicycles” (PUBs), “Bicycle Transit, “Bikesharing” or “Smart Bikes”, bicycle-sharing schems comprise short-term urban bicycle rental schemes that enable bicycles to be picked up at any self-serve bicycle station and returned to any other bicycle station, which makes bicycle-sharing ideal for point-to-point trips. The principle of bicycle-sharing is simple: individuals use bicycle on as “as-needed” basis without the cost and responsibilites of bicycle owership.
Over the past ten years, bicycle-sharing schemes have developed from bein interesting experiments in urban mobility to mainstream public transport options in cities as large and complex as Paris and London. Ten years ago, there were five schemes operating in five countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and Portugal) with a total fleet of 4,000 bicycles. Today there are an estimated 375 bicycles sharing schemes operating in 33 countries in almost every region of the world using around 236,000 bicycles. As can be seen from Figure 1 and 2, the rate of growth in bicycle-sharing schemes and fleets has been very rapid since 2008 and has probably outstripped growth in every other form of urban transport.

 

Opportunities
The rapid growth in bicycle-sharing schemes over the past two years outside of Europe, and especially in South East Asia and Latin America, is an indicator of the attractiveness of such systems and their adaptability to different situations. Opportunities for success are clearly evident but from experience with past and current bicycle-sharing schemes, these opportunities will depend on several key factors like bicycles Re-distribution, Ciclyng infrastructure, Maintenance, Network Configuration, Bicycles, Docking Stations, Safety and Security, Weather and Topography, Public Attitudes to Ciclyng, System Accessibility, and System Availability.

The editor of Shared Mobility met with Mr. Edwin Maria Colella, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer at Omoove. Omoove has been in the Sharing Mobility Market since 2001 and it offers a full suite of products to meet the needs of the most important national and international Car Sharing service providers. From 2016 Omoove is part of OCTO Telematics, the world’s leading insurance telematics provider, to reinforce its technology leadership and create the only Mobility company with a triple integrated play (insurance Telematics, Fleet Management and Car Sharing) with a unique Mobility As A Service platform in the world.
Shared Mobility:
How can Omoove’s technology enable Car Share Operators (CSOs) to achieve greater operational efficiency?
Edwin Colella:
Omoove solution offers a unique integrated solution for fleet management, car sharing, corporate car sharing and ride sharing operators. Our platform is multimodal, multiuser, multivehicle, and multiengine. In fact, it is Multimodal and Multiuser as it supports all car sharing modalities, including “Station Based”, both “one-way” and “round trip”, and “Free Floating” type service models. This is also available for both public car sharing and corporate car sharing. It is Multivehicle and Multiengine because our on-board devices are ready to be (and currently are) installed on dozens of different types of vehicles (cars, scooters and bicycles), with different engines (combustion, electric and hybrid); they are not invasive and provide for full retrieval of all service relevant data at the end of each vehicle use. The platform dedicated to Car Sharing Operators includes several management consoles for the Operators Teams and Front-End functions for end users: web apps, mobile apps and smart watches apps.
Shared Mobility:
In the wider auto industry, more and more connected services in vehicles are relying on the customer’s smartphone as the hub. Are you seeing a shift away from embedded hardware-heavy, car on-board computer solutions in favor of more hardware-light, smartphone-based access solutions?
Edwin Colella:
This shift is happening as a result of a number of reasons, including the need for simple and reliable solutions that have been requested by the Car Sharing operators. We are innovating on both sides of the user-to vehicle interactions. Our on board devices are much simpler and easier to install than ever, and we can easily integrate third party devices (including OEM factory installed hardware). On the users experience side, Omoove offers an innovative and multidevice Mobile User Experience for both Android and iOS operating systems. Moreover, Omoove, in partnership with OT, launched the “easyOpen” solution at MWC2017. This introduces the use of a smartphone with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to quickly and safely manage access to vehicles. It enables users to directly interact with the vehicle using their smart device, even if their smartphone is out of range of network coverage or runs out of battery. The service can also be extended to any wearable device equipped with an SE (embedded Secure Element) supporting NFC technology.
 
Shared Mobility:
How long will it be before CSOs will be offering personalization features (like preferred seating position, music, messages etc.) as soon as the customer steps into the vehicle) as soon as the customer steps into the vehicles?
 
Edwin Colella:
This is an important trend in the innovation path to enrich consumer experience and differentiate Car Sharing from other mobility services. Frost & Sullivan have analysed data to understand driver behavior and offer personalization features. These features include: Wireless induction EV charging, Rapid EV charging, Automated parking, Semi-autonomous driving, V2V technology to provide increased safety, and Calendar-synchronized personal mobility services. All of these technologies will play a pivotal role in improving the experience offered by vehicle-sharing operators. From a pure solution and technology point of view, we already have the tools to analyse driver behavior and offer a more personalized experience to the end users. These innovations will become more and more prevalent from Q1 2018 onwards.

Shared Mobility:
eCarsharing (using electric vehicles) presents special challenges due to the unpredictability of the state of charge of individual vehicles. Can Omoove’s technology support operators to handle this and help ensure consistent availability of EVs in a shared fleet?
Edwin Colella:
Omoove solutions are currently installed on dozens of different types of electric vehicles. We are also cooperating with national electricity corporation to integrate EV charging stations in key cities will enhance opportunities for CSOs and enable electric vehicle charging solution providers to launch new carsharing operations. Our analytics predictive tools is capable to reduce or eliminate the problem of range deficit in EVs, increasing usage and adoption of EV carsharing.
Shared Mobility:
Carsharing technology is yet to penetrate the emerging markets, where only about 20% of the CSOs have taken up to the technology. Do you see this changing any time soon?
Edwin Colella:
Latest carsharing market research shows that the global carsharing market is expected to grow at a CAGR (2015–2025) of 16.4% from 7.9 million to 36.37 million members by 2025 and more than 427,129 vehicles by 2025. One-way is expected to reach 20.88 million members by 2025, accounting for 57% of the total market. This growth includes emerging markets and will be probably driven by both regulatory changes and new entrepreneurs looking wintering in the shared mobility sector with new and innovative market proposal for consumers and corporations.
Shared Mobility:
What is the thing that excites you most about the carsharing business right now?
Edwin Colella:
The economist Professor Rifkin says that the sharing economy is the future of society. To fully embrace the sharing economy, we will require a new business model also in the mobility sector. Personally, I believe that a new group of visionary entrepreneurs will be attracted by this market and challenges. This will give us the opportunity to pursue our innovative proposition and offer them the right solutions to realize their business models. This is what drives me every day and, being part of this mobility revolution is the most exciting challenge!

Vietnam is making the leap from ride-hailing to ride-sharing now that Uber Technologies Inc’s top regional rival has rolled out GrabShare for carpool services in Ho Chi Minh City.
Grab made the announcement on Tuesday in Vietnam’s commercial hub, saying the company’s research showed people would be willing to give up their cars if every hailed ride arrives within three minutes of calling.
Grab bills itself as Vietnam’s first commercial carpool service, though a couple of young Vietnamese already launched a company known as PinBike for so-called motorbike pooling.

“The benefits return to you, each and every one of you, because you spend less time in traffic jams,” Jeremy Lim, head of Grab Vietnam, said in a dramatic press conference announcing the new service.
To underscore his promised ride-share revolution, Lim emerged from a bright green Grab car inside the conference hall. After he alighted, a singer crooned a ditty about making new carpool friends, while attendees snapped selfies behind a cardboard cutout of a bright green Grab vehicle.
Grab will charge customers in Ho Chi Minh City 30% less if they carpool instead of hailing rides individually. The company said incomes for drivers in the region have risen on average 15% in countries that already have GrabShare, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
(Grab and Uber face a crackdown in Thailand on charges their drivers aren’t properly registered or insured.)

Uber and Grab both boast their services reduce traffic by removing idle taxis looking for customers from the road. But Vietnamese are already asking questions whether the ride-hailing apps worsen traffic congestion by attracting more drivers seeking higher wages.
One news report quoted a police chief saying car registrations spiked 30% year-on-year in Ho Chi Minh City during the first three quarters of 2016. The official said many of those new cars are now being used as ride-hailing taxis. With Uber and Grab offering competitive discounts, people who used to travel by motorbike can now afford to hail a four-wheel ride.
Traffic is a “headache,” said National Traffic Safety Committee deputy chair Khuat Viet Hung, who was invited to speak at Grab’s press conference. He said he hopes the Singapore-based company can help authorities ease the gridlock, as well as better manage public transit and tourist travel.
“Grab works closely with the government and with the local government,” Hung said. Since entering Vietnam in 2014, Grab representatives have met with public officials regularly to discuss how to regulate and tax the country’s emerging new sharing economy.

Land of the iconic motorbike, Vietnam is fighting clogged streets by building metro train systems and pedestrian-only promenades to encourage walking. At the same time, Vietnam expects a flood of new cars when the Association of Southeast Asian Nations removes vehicle tariffs among its ten members in 2018. That will allow more locals to buy cars, sales of which already jumped 32% year on year in 2016.
While the transportation sector is in transition, Uber and Grab have been locked in a fierce head-to-head contest, as well as wider competition from traditional taxi competitors like Mai Linh and Vinasun, to be king of Vietnam’s roads. By one estimate, taxis have lost 10% of their previous annual revenues since the introduction of tech-driven foreign challengers.
With a population of 92 million and a fast-growing economy, Vietnam is one of the few places where Uber configured its app for motorbikes as well as cars.
Grab has followed suit, with its motorbike-driving contractors scooting around town with bright green branded helmets, jackets, ponchos and masks. The company has also tried to push customers into putting funds into GrabPay accounts, an e-wallet system to pay not only for rides but also goods from third-party businesses.

As in other regional markets, Grab and Uber have faced opposition in Vietnam from those who allege they pay lower taxes and are less regulated than traditional taxi companies. There have also been reports of contract drivers scamming or endangering passengers. In August, an Uber driver in Ho Chi Minh City reportedly drove a customer into an empty alley and swiped her phone and funds.
The adoption of carpooling poses an additional security element, critics say, especially in a country that doesn’t have a tradition of hitch-hiking or carpooling as in the United States. Nguyen Thi Thuy Phuong, Grab’s Vietnam director of information and markets, has tried to assuage those concerns through a 24-hour hotline to field customer complaints about other customers.
Grab’s carpool option will pilot in Ho Chi Minh City, with a beta test to follow in the capital of Hanoi. “It’s going to be a virtuous cycle,” Lim said with the requisite idealism of a technology start-up pursuing a new market. “The more we use GrabShare, the better it is for society in general.”

As Alaska’s legislative session ends, some perplexing in-house political gamesmanship has kept a popular bipartisan measure from making it to the House floor. It’s a shame, because freedom-loving Alaska now remains one of just a handful of states that still doesn’t allow ridesharing services such as Uber and Lyft to operate within its boundaries.
Senate Bill 14 has passed the full House and needs only a vote of the Senate to move it along to the governor’s office. But according to news reports, the House has bottled up the legislation in the Rules Committee, which rarely meets. The measure reportedly is being used as leverage by legislators fighting a contentious budget battle.
The Alaska Journal of Commerce reports that, instead of letting S.B. 14 get to the House floor and then presumably to the governor for his signature, “the House is effectively starting the legislative process anew by advancing its own version of Uber legislation.”
That’s bad for Alaskans, given the obvious benefits of allowing these services to operate. The bill wisely clarifies that these drivers are independent contractors, thus restricting various efforts to mandate the payment of myriad employee benefits and thereby keeping this a cost-effective option. It also would prevent Alaska cities from imposing their own onerous local restrictions on these services. The bill requires background checks for these TNC drivers, but it’s still overall a good step forward that’s backed by ridesharing companies.
Although Alaska political observers expect that a ridesharing bill will eventually get to the floor at some point this year or next, it’s mistake to delay the ability of these companies to offer not only jobs, but rides to people who need a convenient – or safe – way to get home.
The Economist recently reported on a new study suggesting that “the arrival of Uber to New York City may have helped reduce alcohol-related traffic accidents by 25-35 percent.” According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, Alaska has one of the nation’s highest rates of excessive drinking. Uber and Lyft aren’t a panacea for such a significant social problem, but they could make the streets of Anchorage, Juneau and Fairbanks a bit safer.
With a week to go before the session’s end and a budget crisis looming, legislators might have other things on their mind. But the budget problem will eventually get fixed. Alaska residents who want to use ridesharing services shouldn’t be held hostage to that process.

The increasing popularity of shared mobility will slow global vehicle sales but not reverse them. Although there likely will be fewer new vehicles on the road because of sharing, car sales in developing countries will outpace shared mobility’s impact over the next 15 years. Still, through 2030, roughly a third of the expected increase in vehicle sales from urbanization and macroeconomic growth likely will not happen because of shared mobility (Exhibit 1). Nonetheless, the shared-mobility story isn’t all bad for the industry, especially if automakers, suppliers, and the other mobility players take steps now to position themselves for it.

Exhibit 1



Vehicle sales will outpace the impact of shared mobility primarily because of strong expected growth in Asia and the high replacement frequency of shared vehicles due to their high utilization. Research also suggests that shared mobility will only partially replace car ownership. A 2017 McKinsey survey reveals that 67 percent of all US respondents prefer driving their own cars over using ride-hailing apps, and 63 percent aren’t interested in trading their vehicles for shared-mobility rides—even if they’re free.
While the shared-mobility industry remains embryonic, its new players are already over-taking some much larger automakers with respect to market valuations, suggesting strong investor support.
Sizing the shared-mobility market
In three core regions—China, Europe, and the United States—the shared-mobility market was nearly $54 billion in 2016, and it should continue to experience impressive annual growth rates in the future. Under the most positive scenario, which involves strong customer demand for self-driving taxis or shuttles (so-called robo-taxis or shuttles), in low-density locations and in cities that take steps to enable them, the market could see 28 percent annual growth from 2015 to 2030. Even the least aggressive scenario points to steady growth based on convenience and economics; it projects 15 percent annual expansion, even if customers do not readily adopt robo-taxis and cities do not support them.
Currently, China and the United States are the two largest markets for shared mobility, at $24 billion and $23 billion, respectively. Both markets are dominated by e-hailing players, which hold market shares that exceed 80 percent in each country. Europe’s market, on the other hand, is much smaller, at just under $6 billion, and leans toward car sharing with a more fragmented landscape (cities regulate sharing individually, and the business is more asset intensive).
One insight that’s already apparent from the industry is the lack of a one-size-fits-all mobility model. That means participants need to conduct market segmentations at the city level. Berlin, for example, runs on convenient car sharing, with multiple players and limited e-hailing opportunities because of taxi-related regulation. Meanwhile, Beijing, a mid-income, densely populated city, has a shared-mobility market of more than $700 million. Focused mainly on a strong e-hailing platform, Beijing is a winner-takes-most market where one company controls nearly the entire market.
McKinsey’s 2017 consumer survey indicates shared mobility should see further growth (Exhibit 2). Of those currently using nontaxi ride-hailing services, 63 percent expect to increase their usage “a lot” in the next two years, and even more (67 percent) say they will do the same concerning car sharing.

Exhibit 2



While those who use shared mobility clearly expect to use it much more in the future, it still only accounts for a small fraction of total vehicle miles traveled. In fact, today, shared mobility makes up about one percentage point of the 30 percent of annual vehicle miles traveled that it could currently address. Limitations include the lack of availability of these solutions in rural settings, and sharing tends not to favor frequent commuting due to its cost and the availability of less expensive options such as carpooling. It’s also less attractive for running errands or multistop shopping trips. Shared-mobility solutions do, however, make sense for traveling to social events in urban areas.
Changing the mobility game
Further growth in shared mobility will depend on how effectively the industry eliminates existing customer pain points. For example, some uses such as shared-mobility vehicle pooling can create uncomfortable dynamics among passengers who are basically strangers, while a solo ride-share commute may be too expensive for most people to use daily.
Purpose-built vehicles offer one solution to current issues, especially those concerning cost (Exhibit 3). For instance, in the United States, a typical vehicle might cost nearly $24,000 because it represents a compromise developed to appeal to the broadest spectrum of consumers in target segments. A purpose-built vehicle, on the other hand, could feature lower levels of complexity; less powerful engines; simpler, easier-to-clean interiors; less complicated assembly processes; and lower distribution costs. Such a car could cost almost 25 percent less than a typical vehicle.

Exhibit 3



However, the real game changer is likely to be autonomous vehicles. Take the current limits on shared mobility imposed by population size and density. Today, car sharing is rarely economically viable in cities with fewer than half a million inhabitants. Self-driving cars would enable mobility players to reposition vehicles optimally, allowing smaller fleets to provide adequate coverage and reducing the fixed cost base. Autonomy would also let companies target different user segments via smaller differentiated fleets of vehicles. Vehicle self-parking capabilities could reduce inner-city congestion (for instance, by self-parking in less densely populated areas). These inherent benefits could make car sharing more acceptable to local governments and would likely also increase customer use of the service.
Eliminating the cost for the driver is the unique benefit offered by autonomous vehicles. Roughly 45 percent of the costs of operating an e-hailing vehicle relate to the driver; taking him or her out the equation offers early adopters a huge competitive advantage.
Evolving or transforming completely: What’s ahead for shared mobility?
We see two different paths for the future of shared mobility: the industry could grow steadily in its current state through 2030, or it may become an entirely different market. In our view, three drivers will decide which scenario becomes reality: customer preferences, regulation, and technology.
The status quo path would likely involve steady growth based on convenience and economics, as industry players offer cost-efficient alternatives to taxis and public transportation. The transformative path could see rapid acceleration with the introduction of autonomous vehicles and supportive city initiatives, enabling companies to offer new options for user experience and monetization based on purpose-built vehicles.
While today’s market valuations might suggest otherwise, it remains unclear that the industry’s two leaders will ultimately dominate in a winner-takes-all market. The transformative path could disrupt the current shared-mobility business model if cities regulate self-driving taxis as they do public transportation, if automakers and others operate autonomous vehicle fleets, and if small fleets of self-driving cars prevail.
Automakers attempting to position themselves for the future must determine how to benefit from a market that could take these two alternate paths. The following strategic options might be relevant to either pathway, or to both:

Prepare for purpose-built vehicles (transformative path). Strive to be the first to develop purpose-built vehicles, and cooperate with providers of shared-mobility platforms to scale up quickly and gain market share.
Use shared mobility as an indirect channel (either path). Use shared mobility to ensure fleet emission compliance (via electric vehicles), test new technologies or designs, and gain access to customer data, where legally permissible.
Become a platform player (status quo path). Find ways to access the platform business, and develop strategies to attract a customer base.
Become a fleet operator (transformative path). Develop relationships with key cities and invest in capability building.

Automotive-component suppliers can also take steps to prepare for shared mobility opportunities. Suggestions include the following:

Take advantage of product testing and data opportunities (both paths). Provide components for fleet vehicles and employ shared mobility to test technologies and components and gain access to customer data, where legally permissible.
Become an expert (transformative path). Be the first to develop components for purpose-built vehicles, or build capabilities and become a thought leader in component design for shared-mobility vehicles.
Become a fleet operator (transformative path). Build or strengthen relationships with leading original-equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to cooperate on (or initiate dialogues regarding) purpose-built vehicles.

Global OEMs and suppliers should prepare themselves for both paths, since the shared-mobility market is likely to grow at different speeds and take different forms in various regions. This is also true for many other mobility players beyond the traditional automotive industry.

As shared mobility continues to gain momentum, automakers and their suppliers need to understand what’s driving its popularity, which will vary from country to country and city to city. While shared mobility will probably inhibit new vehicle sales to an extent, automotive players can nonetheless position themselves to benefit from its ultimate success.

New Delhi: A new study conducted by Capgemeni claims that more than 8,000 consumers across eight key markets has indicated that more than a third of car buyers (34%) now see ride sharing and tap and ride services as a genuine alternative to car ownership.
While sales of new cars are continuing to grow significantly, the new data from Capgemini echoes a shift in the strategy of leading manufacturers who are already investing in car sharing services through launches, acquisitions or partnerships, to adjust to the shifting attitudes of consumers.
The 17th Cars Online report ‘Beyond the car’, from Capgemini, a consulting, technology and outsourcing services company, also contains good news for the traditional automotive sales model in the face of explosive growth in car sharing and tap and ride services.
More than half of the respondents see car hailing and ride-sharing services such as Uber, Didi and BlaBlaCar as complementary to buying a new car (56%).
Furthermore, the percentage of those who see mobility services as complementary to buying a car increases when looking at younger car buyers aged 18-34 (64%) and those based in emerging markets China (77%) and India (63%).
The significance of the investments by major manufacturers in car sharing schemes is confirmed by the fact that two-thirds of consumers (66%) state that car brands are an important factor in their choice of the car-sharing program, indicating that these schemes could become an important part of the new car-sales cycle.
Kai Grambow, Global Head of Automotive at Capgemini, said: “We are currently experiencing a golden age of car sales. However it’s clear that this won’t last forever in its current form. Car brands are realizing they need to react to changing consumer habits to sustain growth. Becoming leaders in car sharing and the broader mobility space will not just create new revenue streams for car manufacturers, but will also allow brands to raise awareness and establish a new kind of relationship with consumers as they decide on their next model to purchase.”
Other key report findings show the broader impact of a rapid rise in technological capabilities and awareness among consumers on purchasing habits:
• Autonomous driving features remain a significant selling point for consumers. With assisted-driving functionality becoming standard on mainstream car models and regular reports of new autonomous-vehicle tests, 81% of respondents are willing to pay additional costs for autonomous-driving features.
• Cybersecurity has now emerged as a key factor in car purchasing. In 2015, a third of respondents were concerned about cyber security. After further high-profile hacks of automotive platforms, consumers want re-assurance from manufacturers that cars are secure, with over two-thirds of car buyers (68%) stating that the cyber resilience of a car would influence whether they bought it or not.
• Consumer interest in buying cars from tech brands is increasing despite lack of substance. A further 18 months of rumors that Google or Apple will launch cars has seen consumer interest increase from the 2015 study (49%), to well over half of consumers (57%) who are now open to buying a vehicle from a technology company such as Apple or Google.
• Consumer trust of autonomous vehicles is split between established and new players. Given that the tech companies have led many of the public-testing exercises for autonomous vehicles, it’s significant that half of the consumers (51%) would have more trust in car manufacturers producing a car with autonomous capabilities over a technology-firm produced car.
• Data privacy concerns are reducing as consumers embrace the connected-device model. Familiarity with other connected devices and the tradeoff between data sharing and greater personalization and better services is changing consumer attitudes to connected cars. The majority of consumers would be willing to share their vehicle data (89%) and driver data (76%) while the car is connected.
• Demand for digital showrooms is challenging the traditional sales model. No doubt influenced by the continued consumer interest in disruptive technologies and virtual showroom launches from a number of major manufacturers, consumers are demanding alternative methods of finding information through OEMs and dealers, such as virtual reality vehicle presentations (62%), live chats (43%) and video blogs from customers (36%).

Optimal Charging of Electric vehicle fleets.
In the study presented by E. Biondi, C. Boldrini, and R. Bruno, from the Institute for Informatics and Telematics, (IIT-CNR), the authors underlined that electric car sharing services have been growing in popularity in the last years but operators are striving to reduce the costs of deploying and managing their charging infrastructure. Charging technologies that offer power sharing have the potential to achieve this goal but at the cost of increasing management complexity. In order to address this problem, in their work the authors propose an efficient optimized charging methodology that minimizes recharging costs when power sharing is used and also takes into account customer satisfaction. To this aim, they formulate the recharging problem as a two-step optimization problem, considering a realistic energy pricing scheme, and they evaluate this solution using real traces of parking times in a French station-based car sharing system. They show that significant cost savings can be achieved without impacting customer satisfaction and also reducing the strain on the grid with respect to a baseline approach.
In the study the authors have considered the problem of minimising the recharging cost of the electric fleet of one-way car-sharing systems using power sharing. To cope with the problem complexity, they have formulated a two-step optimisation framework that separately assigns EVs’ energy claims to each time slot and the charging profiles for each station. They have tested the propose solution using a real-life trace of pickup and drop-off events at the stations of a large car sharing operator in Paris. The results shown demonstrate that not only their proposed strategies reduce the costs for the car sharing operator without affecting the quality of service perceived by the users, but also provide smaller peak loads and higher load factors than a simple greedy approach.

The government body says India has the enabling factors like entrepreneurial skills, confluence of information technology and manufacturing skills and public- and private-sector leadership to lead the world in advanced mobility services.
‘India Leaps Ahead: Transformative Mobility Solution’, a joint report produced by NITI Aayog and Rock Mountain Institute, says accelerated adoption of electric and shared vehicles could save $60 billion in diesel and petrol costs while cutting down as much as 1 gigatonne (GT) of carbon emissions for India by 2030, says a joint report released today by Niti Aayog.

×

It adds, however, that the country faces challenges that signal the “gravitational pull of privately owned vehicles”. The report estimates that India can conservatively save up to 64 percent of anticipated passenger mobility-related energy demand and 37 percent of carbon emission by 2030.
“By 2030, this would result in an annual diesel and petrol reduction of 156 million tonnes of oil equivalent,” said the report,“At current oil prices, this would imply a net usual fuel cost saving of approximately 3.9 lakh crore by 2030,” the report added, says PTI. Releasing the report, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said whether one likes it or not electric vehicles (EVs) will happen in India.
The challenge is how we do it quickly. How do we do it to scale and size,” he said.
Noting that the cost of batteries is falling by about half every five years, he said that as a result in the next 4-5 years, EVs even with batteries would not be far more expensive than petrol or diesel vehicle, while operational cost will be just 20 percent of that of a petrol vehicle.
Stressing that the government is fully committed to driving this electric vehicles programme, Kant said EVs will come into India in a big way in about a decade. “But the challenge is if we delay it then we will end up importing batteries instead of oil and it will be difficult for us to take leadership,” he cautioned.
“So we should drive our own EVs programme, which will enable us to manufacture EVs,” Kant added. He also pointed out that quick volume alone will enable India EVs programme to succeed.
“And therefore aggregation of demand on a large scale is important. Its important that government drives it by focusing on government vehices and public vehicles,” Kant said
New mobility paradigm
India’s current mobility system reflects many of the underlying properties of this new mobility paradigm. These elements include a high share of non-motorised transit, low private-vehicle ownership, a diverse set of mode options, and strong IT capabilities. As India continues to develop at a rapid pace, it is essential to maintain and invest in these attributes, as they serve as the foundation of a shared, electric, and connected mobility system.
This starting point enables India to leapfrog towards ambitious goals of 6-7 million xEVs by 2020 and 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022. Niti Aayog says today, many of the technologies and business models that support this vision are already cost-effective, high-quality, and convenient. For example, many HEVs, PHEVs, and battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which represent a progression of increasing intensity of vehicle electrification, are becoming cost-competitive and can become more so through bulk procurement of their common assembly- and subassembly-level parts. The affirmation of the NEMMP-2020 roadmap and continuation of the FAME scheme are important indicators for OEMs that play critical roles in bringing more xEV products to the Indian marketplace.
Three-phased strategic plan from 2017-2032
Niti Aayog and RMI have drawn three strategic phases covering the action plan for next 15 years, until 2032. These include:
Phase 1 (‘Notching the Arrow’, 2017–2019) prioritises solutions that are already economic and capable of rapid scaling, while cultivating solutions that are nearly economic.
Phase 2 (‘Drawing the Bow’, 2020–2023), opportunities that were introduced in Phase 1 are being refined and scaled, while the options that were previously identified as nearly economic have become cost-effective and ready for deployment. Simultaneously, public- and private-sector action continues to lay the groundwork for enhancing the economics and feasibility of future opportunities.
Phase 3 (‘Letting the Arrow Fly’, 2024–2032), more opportunities become economic and scale to the national level. Emerging ideas follow this same trajectory, while systemic solutions from lighthouse examples help integrate technology, design, and business models at a national scale.
Too ambitious a project?
The Niti Aayog report says with collective ambition from stakeholders across the private sector and government, India has the potential to turn this green mobility vision into reality and emerge as a global role model in advanced mobility solutions.
Chetan Maini, who was part of the two-day workshop a couple of months ago, says this time around there has been a very good collective effort of a varied number of stakeholders to build a conducive eco-system for electric mobility to be a reality in India.
Opportunities for India automotive
The workshop organised in New Delhi on February 27-28 saw participation from senior government officials from concerned ministries, representatives from the private sector (auto and mobility sectors, banks and financial institutions), civil society, academia and NGOs.
A total of 75 key participants chalked out 12 detailed opportunity areas for action, which can also serve as the building blocks for India’s shared, electric and connected mobility future, at the two-day workshop.
Among all the opportunities, three themes stand out for their overarching impact. These include scaled manufacturing (to create xEV supply), shared infrastructure development (set up supportive ecosystem for pedestrians, cyclists and passengers) and system integration (build demand and enhance efficiency through data sharing and policy frameworks).
According to the report, these three themes lend structure to the list of actionable solutions, clarify the implementation approach and provide a framework for ongoing discussions and debates.
Here’s taking a closer look at some of them, as depicted below:

Back in January, the U.S. Department of Transportation selected Texas as one of the 10 regions that would test out autonomic vehicles. “With five of the nation’s 15 fastest-growing cities in Texas and our population expected to potentially double by the year 2050, Texas must be a leader in new technology that addresses transportation challenges,” said Marc Williams, deputy executive director of the Texas Department of Transportation in a statement.
The program will help guide the creation of safety regulations for the new technology. But before autonomous vehicles take to the roads here, policymakers should take specific steps to plan for their integration, according to a new report. With more drivers likely to switch from owning and driving their own cars to driverless ride-sharing services, cities risk increased congestion, the study argues. But with the right policies in place, cities could actually alleviate traffic, spur the mixed-use development that most Americans say they want and strengthen access to jobs and services for all residents.
“Public policy will play a decisive role in shaping AV technology and guiding its impact on cities, as it did during past technological revolutions involving the railroad, the streetcar, and the automobile,” notes the report, co-authored by three high-profile design, planning and development firms; Arcadis, Inc., HR&A Advisors, Inc. and Sam Schwartz Consulting, LLC.  “Cities that do nothing face major risks.”
Assuming that ride-sharing services using driverless technology — Uber has already started testing out its technology on city streets — will represent an increasing share of cars on the road, the report says this shift could be “highly disruptive” for many cities, as fewer people own or drive their own cars.
Some of the biggest gains in shared usage could actually be seen in suburban areas. “Most of the transition is expected to be from lower-density areas where car ownership is highest,” reads the report. In contrast, it warns, “there is a possibility that transit ridership may also shift in higher density areas – increasing the number of cars on the road – if not correctly managed by cities.”

Source: Arcadis, Inc., HR&A Advisors, Inc. and Sam Schwartz Consulting, LLC.

The potential negative effects of driverless technology are large, according to the report: transit agencies could see a decrease in revenues, professional drivers could lose business and face unemployment and cities could have a glut of now mostly obsolete parking lots and parking spaces. With an estimated 12.5 million off-street parking spaces in the Houston-Galveston region, according to the Houston-Galveston Area Council, that transformation of land use represents both a challenge and opportunity for Houston.
As vehicle ownership declines, the need for robust public transit systems that work with autonomous vehicle technology increases. Otherwise, the report warns, transit agencies risk losing business as more people look to driverless ride-sharing. The report outlines how rail, bus rapid transit and even driverless shuttles can provide greater mobility and reduce congestion.
In addition to providing robust public transportation that focuses on high-frequency, high-capacity and first- and last-mile connections, the report argues, cities should encourage “mixed-use, car-light” neighborhoods. That’s something that more and more Houstonians express interest in, with an increasing percentage saying they’d prefer to live “a smaller home in a more urbanized area, within walking distance of shops and workplaces,” according to the annual Kinder Houston Area Survey. Updating parking requirements for businesses and developments is one strategy but the report also suggests building “future-proof garages,” that could easily convert to housing or office space once they’re no longer needed.
The report, which analyzed how driverless technology might impact Los Angeles, Dallas and New York City, also mentions building on successful strategies to both enhance mobility — think apps that integrate mobile ticketing between multiple transit providers, including any driverless ride-sharing services — and promote specific transit goals, like dynamic pricing that can be tailored to both the user’s income as well as variables like congestion or miles traveled. These dynamic pricing strategies can help manage traffic flow by incentivizing public transit usage during key times — think everyone trying to get on the road in a driverless ride-share car during rush hour.
But equally critical to a jurisdiction’s effort to plan for the integration of autonomous vehicles is an emphasis on equity. With cities facing increasing inequality, this should already be a concern for policymakers. Here, the report points to regulations that specifically promote equity and access for all users — like pay-as-you-go smart cards that work for people without bank accounts — financial subsidies for riders as well as training for professional drivers to keep up in a changing industry.
The concern is that not only could driverless technology be disruptive, it could also exacerbate or generate disparities within cities. “All new technologies, when distributed rapidly, create new inequities,” note a policy brief from the University of California, Davis’ Institute of Transportation Studies on the topic. Prepared by Stuart Cohen, executive director of the transit advocacy group TransForm, and Sahar Shiraz, from the California Governor’s Office of Planning and Research, the brief argues that new policies or projects relating to new vehicle technologies should be evaluated for how it impacts low-income households using four criteria: cost, access, public health and employment.
Cohen and Shiraz also point to several innovative efforts to combat the spread of inequality, like Los Angeles’ electric car-sharing program for low-income residents. Using the funds companies pay to offset pollution, the state helps subsidize the program as a private-public partnership with the Blue California company, targeting neighborhoods marked by both low household incomes and high traffic and industrial pollution.
“Just as public agencies intervened to ensure that electricity got to rural areas and phones are affordable to more,” the brief concludes, “it is imperative we find ways to ensure that the promise of [fleets of autonomous vehicles that are electric and shared] improve the lives of those who now face the most serious transportation barriers.”

The concept of ridesharing has existed for decades, but big names like Uber and Lyft have pushed the idea further, allowing us to hitch a ride in a private-car instead of a cab.
However, not all these services are real ridesharing, but rather a private taxi service.

“Real ridesharing, like Zimride and BlaBlaCar, match multiple travellers into the same car and each traveller, including the driver, specifies when and where they are going from and to”, explains project researcher Yaoli Wang, from the Department of Infrastructure Engineering, University of Melbourne.
“Even UberPool’s model of sharing rides is rather ridesourcing since the driver does not start with a specified travel destination in mind.”
Despite all the hype, and the commonly accepted benefits for traffic, the environment and the private purse, there are reasons why ridesharing is not as popular as it could be. Mainly because people are reluctant to detour for others, trust strangers, or to share personal space.
Disruptive technologies such as driverless cars carry the potential to change the paradigms for ridesharing. Cost models will change the perceived need for a private car, and mobility will be seen as a service rather than a dependency for a driver.
Ridesharing is the future of urban travel, and has been the focus of study for the Computational Transportation Science group at the University of Melbourne for more than a decade.
A new perspective
Today, Uber’s ad reads “We ask only one question: Where to?”. This is also the question posed by almost every ridesharing application at the moment. But is this really the best question to ask, given all the reluctance to take up ridesharing? It certainly doesn’t address trust or flexibility.
The team at the University of Melbourne is now asking the question: “who do you want to share a ride with?” rather than “who can you share a ride with?”. And a follow-up: “what do you want to do?” rather than “where to?”
Could the answer for mainstream acceptance lie in social networking?
Friends and trust
Busy commuters don’t want to sacrifice too much detour time for a stranger, and many don’t want to share with a stranger at all. It’s these problems that have led to the development of a new ridesharing concept – social network-based ridesharing.
Companies like Uber and Lyft have pushed the concept of ridesharing. Photo: Pexels
Social network-based ridesharing applies preferential matching with ‘friends’ within your social media network, even if this increases travel time when compared to rides with strangers. Meanwhile, the option to share with strangers is not removed, but becomes a fall-back when your preferred matches cannot be found in time.
In this approach, sharing rides with strangers also has the positive potential of building new friendships, introducing people who travel similar routes every day but never say a word to each other and changing their perceptions of sharing space with a stranger. Social network-based ridesharing could change people’s perception of sharing a space with this stranger, thus increasing and broadening their own social network.
Travel budget and flexibility

Designing cities with health in mind

Another concern is that no one wants to be delayed on their journey or run late. But if commuters stick to pre-existing friendship circles for ridesharing, they could be missing out on those people nearby who share exactly the same route.
This disadvantage is addressed by activity-based ridesharing: a ridesharing strategy that allows you to choose from multiple alternative places to pursue an activity (like shopping or exercising) within your time budget and with the added bonus of increasing your chance of finding a ride.
“Many activities are not limited to one location, even if you had one particular location in mind when requesting a ride. Imagine you want to go the gym; if currently no ride is available for your usual one, you might be happy to get a ride to another branch of the same gym chain,” explains lead researcher Professor Stephan Winter, who works in the Spatial Information Science in the Department of Infrastructure Engineering, University of Melbourne.
What are the next steps?
The two approaches of social network-based ridesharing and activity-based ridesharing can be combined. Collaborative activity-based ridesharing achieves both, matching traveller’s preferences, and profiting from the higher flexibility of activity-based ridesharing.

Managing the big transitions
Read more

The next step is making collaborative activity-based ridesharing viable for everyday life. This involves a number of practical challenges, from mechanisms to form and maintain networks in a trustworthy and socially acceptable manner, to managing the technical complexity.
We need good approximation algorithms to cope with the number of potential travellers and the possible destinations. Additionally, there needs to be a focus on local solutions to the rideshare matching problem, aiming to get rid of central platforms (like Uber) altogether.
“Finding an ad-hoc ride requires the vehicle to be nearby – limiting my search to the immediate neighbourhood, using short range communication protocols, instead of relying on a server that is managing all ride opportunities and all rides requested in a city,” says Professor Winter.
Urban mobility as we know it already shows signs of being disrupted – and where it goes from here, with the impact of social media, could see many more of us sharing a ride in the future.

The “planning for shared mobility conference” will be held next Monday, May 8, 2017, in New York, at Jakob K. Javits Convention Center, organized by the APA, American Planning Association. The conference will give you the opportunity to learn about the role of shared mobility in urban planning. Identify challenges and opportunities for planners, policymakers, and public agencies interested in implementing shared modes and developing shared mobility policy in local and regional governments. Engage with private-sector transportation technology innovators and stakeholders and learn more about opportunities for public-private partnerships.
In recent years, economic, environmental, and social forces have quickly given rise to the “sharing economy,” a collective of entrepreneurs and consumers leveraging technology to share resources, save money, and generate capital. Homesharing services, such as Airbnb, and microtransit services, such as Via, have become part of a sociodemographic trend that has pushed the sharing economy from the fringe and more to the mainstream. The role of shared mobility in the broader landscape of urban mobility has become a frequent topic of discussion. Major shared transportation modes—such as bikesharing, carsharing, ridesourcing, and alternative transit services—are changing how people travel and are having a transformative effect on mobility and local planning.
Shared mobility—the shared use of a vehicle, bicycle, or other low-speed travel modes—is an innovative transportation strategy that enables users to have short-term access to a mode of transportation on an as-needed basis. Shared mobility includes various service models and transportation modes that meet the diverse needs of travelers. Shared mobility can include roundtrip services (vehicle, bicycle, or other low-speed mode is returned to its origin); one-way station-based services (vehicle, bicycle, or low-speed mode is returned to a different designated station location); and one-way free-floating services (vehicle, bicycle, or low-speed mode can be returned anywhere within a geographic area).
The rise of shared mobility has disrupted existing products and services in the urban mobility space. App-based for-hire vehicle services such as Uber and Lyft have challenged the taxi, livery, carsharing, and mass-transit establishment. Disruptive innovations like this have the power to not only redefine industries but also bankrupt companies. Fundamental changes in transportation are a great challenge and opportunity at the same time—this requires a systemic view of the evolving transformation.
Shared mobility directly influences and is influenced by most facets of urban planning. This workshop examines the interdependencies, synergies, opportunities, and challenges associated with shared mobility.

Hong Kong is finally jumping on the bandwagon – or bicycle – of the bike-sharing trend which has taken the mainland by storm. Starting Thursday, cyclists can use more than 400 smart bicycles in the New Territories by simply scanning a QR code.
Start-up Gobee.bike, founded by Hong Kong-based entrepreneur Raphael Cohen two months ago, aims to offer busy people an easy option for short distance commute. The service works by allowing cyclists to rent and drop off bicycles around the city.
Following the success stories of mainland counterparts such as Ofo, which runs in 50 Chinese cities and has a market value that jumped to US$2 billion (HK$15.5 billion) in less than two years, Cohen said Hong Kong also had a huge potential for the business model.
“We are here to make transportation convenient and affordable,” he added. A ride on a Gobee bike will cost HK$5 per half hour. Currently, bike rentals for leisure purposes cost HK$40 per day in Tai Po.
Cohen said that there was a great demand for bike-sharing in a city like Hong Kong, where people walked considerable distances between public transport stops. Bicycles would ideally fill this gap.
To rent a Gobee bike powered by solar panels, users will need to log into a mobile application, register their credit card and pay a deposit of HK$399. An active map will locate the nearest bicycle which can be unlocked by scanning a QR code.

Currently, the mobile application is only accessible on Android devices, but an iOS platform for Apple users will be launched next week.
The company has 400 bikes along tracks in Sha Tin, Tai Po, and Ma On Shan. The number is expected to reach 1,000 by the end of the week, and 20,000 by July.
Unlike existing bike rental services in Hong Kong, cyclists riding Gobee bikes will not have to pick up and drop their bicycles at designated locations.
“Technically, you can park them anywhere as long as it is legal,” Cohen said, referring to public racks across the city.
He said the service could also be a solution for people who had very limited living space to store their own bikes.
But commuters on Hong Kong Island and in Kowloon – two regions which are more crowded – will only have access to the service by the end of the year, partly due to the lack of cycling tracks and supporting infrastructure.
The Hong Kong Cycling Alliance welcomed the launch of the first bike-sharing service in the city and expected high usage rates.
“App-based bike sharing is about to conquer the world, and it’s fantastic that Hong Kong has this new programme ahead of so many other places,” Martin Turner, chairman of the alliance, said.

We are witnessing a paradigm shift away from the exclusive ownership and consumption of resources to one of shared use and consumption. This paradigm shift is taking advantage of innovative new ways of peer-to-peer sharing that are voluntary and enabled by internet-based exchange markets and mediation platforms. Value is derived from the fact that most resources are acquired to satisfy peak demand but are otherwise poorly utilized (e.g., the average car in the US is used less than 10 percent). Several successful businesses in the US and elsewhere, such as AirBnB for rooms in private homes, Uber for taxi service, LiquidOffice for office space, RelayRides for private car sharing, and TaskRabbit for errands, among many others, provide a proof of concept and evidence for the viability of the collaborative consumption concept. Collectively, these businesses and other manifestations of collaborative consumption are giving rise to what is becoming known as the sharing economy. Collaborative consumption has the potential of increasing access while reducing investments in resources and infrastructure. In turn this could have the twin benefit of improving consumer welfare (individuals who may not otherwise afford a product now have an opportunity to use it) while reducing societal costs (externalities, such as pollution that may be associated with production, distribution use, and disposal of the product). Take cars for example. The availability of a sharing option is likely to lead some to forego car ownership in favor of on-demand access. In turn, this could result in a corresponding reduction in road capacity and parking infrastructure. However, increased collaborative consumption may have other consequences, some of which may be undesirable. For example, greater access to cars could increase car usage and, therefore, lead to more congestion and pollution if it is not accompanied by a sufficient reduction in the numbers of cars. This could occur if sharing leads to speculative investments in cars and price inflation, or if yet it affects the availability and pricing of other modes of public transport (e.g., taxis, buses, and trains). Collaborative consumption raises several important questions. How does collaborative consumption affect ownership and usage of resources? Is it necessarily the case that collaborative consumption leads to lower ownership, lower usage, or both (and therefore to improved sustainability)? If not, what conditions would favor lower ownership, lower usage, or both? How would the platform set prices, commissions, and membership fees and under what conditions would choices for these parameters lead to socially desirable outcomes? To what extent would a private platform (a platform that maximizes its own profit) improve social welfare? How far would the resulting social welfare be from that obtained under a public platform (a platform that maximizes social welfare)? What public policies, if enacted, would ensure that collaborative consumption would lead to higher social welfare? I the following paper the authors address these and other related questions in the context of peer-to-peer car sharing.

About the SOLUTIONS project
The overall mission of SOLUTIONS is to support the uptake of innovative sustainable urban mobility solutions in Europe and other regions in the world, in particular in Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean. Transport is a key enabler of economic activity and social connectivity. While providing essential services to society, transport is also an important part of the economy and it is at the core of a number of major sustainability challenges, such as climate change, air quality, safety, energy, security and efficiency in the use of resources. There will be a variety of aspects to be considered within the knowledge sharing and mutual learning elements of the SOLUTIONS project. While sharing experiences on sustainable urban mobility solutions the key focus of the project will be to identify innovative measures in the partner countries and test their applicability to European cities around the world. SOLUTIONS will facilitate a North-South-South-North dialogue and exchange, contributing to a high degree of integration of knowledge and resource sharing. The project is organised into five main parts to realise the take-up of sustainable mobility solutions. An initial transferability assessment (WP1) is followed by a knowledge-sharing and capacity building plan (WP2). Both form the basis for transfer, take-up and future cooperation in Asia and Latin America (WP3) as well as transfer and future research cooperation in the Mediterranean (WP4). The results will be widely promoted through global dialogue, dissemination and outreach (WP5). The strategic impact of the project will be to:

Foster the deployment of innovative transport solutions in Europe and across the world to reach European and global agreements on sustainable urban mobility, energy efficiency and fight against climate change.
Support the structured transfer of innovative transport solutions from the European industry and service sector to other regions in the world.
Contribute to better global dialogue amongst policy-makers and practitioners in urban transport from Europe and other industrialised and emerging countries.
Develop research cooperation with Mediterranean partner countries in the field of urban transport.

Transferability approach
Cities around the world have a need to establish sustainable transport systems, which provide efficient and safe mobility for their citizens with minimum environmental impacts. With limited opportunity to build new infrastructure, many cities need to increase the efficiency and capacity of their transport systems and are turning to innovative and technically-advanced systems to contribute to this objective. SOLUTIONS will build on a range of EU and international-cooperation projects that have assessed innovation and good practice in transport. It will identify innovative and green urban transport and mobility solutions from around the world and select a number of solutions that may be suitable for transfer to cities within the SOLUTIONS regions of Asia, Latin America and Europe. Obviously, the take-up of urban mobility and transport solutions between global regions is particularly challenging as socio-economic conditions and policy frameworks differ substantially across the regions. Within Europe, a number of projects have successfully demonstrated take-up between cities, which confirms the value of collaborative learning and exchange of experiences within different cultures and planning practices (e.g. CIVITAS, TIDE, Niches).
Cities, regions and countries often share similar challenges and there are always more or less progressive cities. Whilst there are advantages to sharing examples, learning and best practices, it is more fruitful to follow a robust methodology to help achieve widespread implementation and harmonisation of successful policies, measures and technologies.
Transferability is a process of assessing the potential of a successful implementation of a measure in a new location. The process involves analyzing various factors, which have the potential to influence the implementation and learning from the experiences in the pioneer cities. The use of a transferability methodology provides an opportunity to learn from the previous experience of implementation to better exploit opportunities and avoid mistakes.
A successful implementation of a measure in one city does not automatically mean that it is suitable for transfer to other cities; the right conditions are needed to make it a reality. The replication of success in a different urban context is challenging as the cities can differ in many aspects of transport and traffic conditions (demand, supply, infrastructure, traffic control and management etc.), geographical, environmental, demographic, socio-economic and cultural backgrounds as well as institutional and legal frameworks (CIVITAS, 2012). The transferability methodology developed for this project will help to identify those factors, which are key to the measure’s success and must be addressed in a new location. It also helps to identify any factors, which may create barriers, so that they can either be overcome or the decision can be made not to introduce the measure.

Thematic clusters in SOLUTIONS
SOLUTIONS has identified a number of potential planning and policy measures and grouped them into six thematic clusters. The topic areas are derived from the call text and encompass measures to improve the sustainability of urban mobility, focusing on solutions that can be directly implemented by local authorities. The thematic depth and focus takes into account the different levels of maturity of sustainable mobility policy in the partner regions and the ability to adopt solutions. The six thematic clusters are:

Cluster 1: public transport
Cluster 2: transport infrastructure
Cluster 3: city logistics
Cluster 4: integrated planning and Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans
Cluster 5: network and mobility management
Cluster 6: clean vehicles

Sharing rides could drastically improve the efficiency of car and taxi transportation. Unleashing such potential, however, requires understanding how urban parameters affect the fraction of individual trips that can be shared, a quantity that they call shareability. Using data on millions of taxi trips in New York City, San Francisco, Singapore, and Vienna, the researchers compute the shareability curves for each city, and find that a natural rescaling collapses them onto a single, universal curve. They explain this scaling law theoretically with a simple model that predicts the potential for ride sharing in any city, using a few basic urban quantities and no adjustable parameters. Accurate extrapolations of this type will help planners, transportation companies, and society at large to shape a sustainable path for urban growth.

The emerging sharing economy promises to improve the efficiency of individual, on-demand transportation. Bridging the gap between shared but inflexible public transportation and flexible but not shared private transportation, novel services can significantly contribute to reducing road congestion and emissions. But the realizability of such potential benefits depends on the answer to a fundamental unsolved question: How compatible in space and time – and thus shareable – are individual mobility patterns?

A lead role in future, too
The significance of the Chinese market for the international auto industry is indisputable. Over the past decades, the nation has not only written an unparalleled success story in the development of individual mobility for its population but meanwhile virtually all the international auto manufactures are present on this motor vehicle market, which is the world’s biggest and has developed a momentum barely foreseeable a good decade ago. And joining these international players is a growing number of domestic auto brands.
Meantime, China’s rapid development in the auto sector is moving on and inexorably turning to new forms of energy. According to SAE, China will have a market share of 50 percent in electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids by 2030. By 2020, the number of new-energy vehicles is expected to rise to 5 million and include plug-in hybrids, electric and fuel-cell vehicles. The most recent study published by China’s Society of Automotive Engineers is thus formulating ambitious goals for the Middle Kingdom.
“It’s evident that now and in future, the Chinese auto market is and will be playing an extremely important role in the spread of electromobility even beyond its national borders,” says Horst Binnig, CEO of German auto-industry supplier Rheinmetall Automotive on the occasion of Auto Shanghai beginning on April 21. For over twenty years now, this company has been present on the Chinese market, where 5,000 employees generate sales of just under a billion euros. Rheinmetall Automotive, too, identifies clear signs that the Chinese market is steadily migrating towards new forms of energy.
The product range of this globally present supplier extends from electrified components for hybrid drives, such as variable auxiliary components or pumps, via parts for lightweight applications to products for all-electric propulsion. Even now, these include battery trays for electric vehicles or special housings for the complete electric motor which, in future, will be manufactured locally for the Chinese market by Rheinmetall Automotive.
Binnig goes on to say, “The world of automotive technology is watching China. And it will do so even more attentively in future, since many important parameters are suggesting that the world’s biggest auto market will again play a lead role when it comes to electromobility.”
It is a fact that the Chinese authorities are currently rigorously enforcing new emission standards patterned after the European model, such as right now in Beijing and Shanghai. Added to this is the requirement for a constant reduction in Corporate Average Fuel Consumption (CAFC) which has dropped from 6.7 liters/100 km in 2016 to 5 liters by 2020 and as little as 4 liters by 2025. This will almost inevitably call for a mixture of innovative drive systems.
Alternative drive systems is another area in which the Chinese government is providing support in many different ways. This is shown by the “supercredits” currently being debated and applying to energy-efficient vehicles with a consumption of under 2.8 liters/100 km and to new-energy vehicles (NEVs). The threshold to be obtained will probably start for NEVs at 5 percent as from 2018, climbing to 12 in the following two years.
Meantime, China is busy expanding a network of charging stations along the main traffic axes. Also, all and any new buildings must feature charging stations for electric vehicles. One-tenth of all existing parking places must be retrofitted to allow recharging. In all, China is planning on having 4.8 million charging stations by 2020.
In addition, China is massively promoting the purchase of electric vehicles at national, regional and municipal levels. Such incentives apply not only to the price of a vehicle, or the purchase and motor vehicle taxes, they also concern the even more coveted vehicle registration, especially in the megacities. Added to this are the incentives when recharging the vehicles. Here, too, the capital Beijing is a front-runner, since even now it no longer promotes plug-in hybrids (PHV) but is focusing on all-electric vehicles (EV).
The measures undertaken by the state are also impacting on the motor vehicle industry itself. Those OEMs contemplating a new base in China will, according to a resolution by the State Council of last October, find it difficult to obtain approval if their production line-up fails to include electric vehicles. Meanwhile, eleven Chinese companies have already obtained a license to build such vehicles.
Horst Binnig: “The Chinese government’s extensive action package when combined with such new options as “shared mobility” or new vehicle-utilization arrangements, will help propel the Chinese market for electric vehicles and consolidate China’s pioneering role as the world’s most important auto market.” Of this the Rheinmetall Automotive CEO is convinced, adding: “And what is happening tomorrow in China will, the day after at the very latest, have also implications for all the international markets of our industry.”http://www.foundry-planet.com/news/corporate-news/detail-view/china-to-become-central-driving-force-in-worldwide-electromobility/?cHash=a79f81d015b1f5041db572afe051b01a

Free-floating car-sharing schemes operate without fixed car-sharing stations, ahead reservations or return-trip requirements. Providing fast and convenient motorization, they attract both public transportation users and (former) car-owners. However, given their highly flexible nature and different pricing structures, previous findings on user groups and environmental impact of station-based car-sharing may not be easily transferable. Therefore, this research uses survey data to compare user groups and usage patterns of a free-floating and station-based car-sharing service both operating in the city of Basel, Switzerland. The findings suggest, that the schemes indeed attract different user groups and are also used differently. Moreover, we see, that car-sharing membership is governed by other factors than car-sharing activity.
Introduction
Since its first implementation in the late 1940s, car-sharing has long been a niche service, unable to attract a substantial share of the urban population. This was due to both the inflexibility of car-sharing schemes themselves and the social importance of car ownership. In recent years, the game has changed; modern information technology has allowed the schemes to become more user-friendly and social trends favoring sharing over ownership support their adoption.
One of the latest additions to the car-sharing market is free-floating car-sharing. Instead of relying on designated car-sharing stations, it allows customers to pick up and drop off the vehicle anywhere within a city-wide service area. Through this innovation, it removed the obstacles of station-based car-sharing, such as required advance reservations and restrictions on a set of pre-defined stations as trip origins and destinations.
The introduction of free-floating car-sharing in Basel allows investigation of the usage and impacts of two different forms of car-sharing in a Swiss context for the first time. Using new data, this research allows direct comparison of user groups and usage patterns for a station-based and a free-floating car-sharing scheme operating in the same city. The results are a first step towards better understanding the specific market niche of free-floating car-sharing.
Car-sharing schemes in Basel: free-floating car sharing Vs. fixed car-sharing stations.
At this point in our research, Basel is the only city in Switzerland with both station-based and free-floating car-sharing schemes.
The station-based car-sharing scheme currently operating in Switzerland dates back to 1987. Available not only in larger cities like Basel, but also in smaller towns and villages, it is probably the only scheme worldwide offering a seamless system serving a whole country. It offers access to almost 3000 vehicles of various types at 1500 car-sharing stations. Members can either: buy a share of the cooperative (one-time investment of 1250 CHF of which 1000 CHF is refundable upon exit; 1.00 CHF = 0.68 USD at purchasing power parity, OECD 2015), or subscribe to the service for an annual fee of 200–300 CHF. The membership fee can be substantially reduced to CHF 25 for holders of a public transportation subscription, although these members pay higher rental fees. Rentals are charged both by the hour and by distance travelled (3–4 CHF/h plus 0.50–1.00 CHF/km, depending on the vehicle type and time of the day).
In August 2014, a free-floating car-sharing pilot program was launched in Basel, Switzerland. 120 cars of the type VW Up were distributed around the city. They can be located via a website or smartphone-app and reserved up to 15 min in advance. Customers must pay a small registration fee (25 CHF) upfront and then only pay on a per-use basis. The fare structure distinguishes between parking and driving time; customers are charged per minute (fares: 0.41 CHF/min driving and 0.24 CHF/min parking). At the end of the journey, the vehicle can be parked on any public parking spot within the service area, where it then becomes available for other members.
Although both the station-based round-trip car-sharing scheme and the free-floating car-sharing scheme are operated by the same company, they are run entirely separately from each other. As a consequence, customers wishing to use both schemes must register for each scheme separately.
Discussion
Results from the questionnaires largely confirm and extend findings from other studies on both station-based and free-floating car-sharing. For example, overall results confirm that both schemes mainly attract younger and highly educated people living in households with few private cars (Burkhardt and Millard-Ball, 2006; Firnkorn and Müller, 2012 ;  BMW et al., 2016). However, the model highlights important differences; while station-based car-sharing seems to be adopted mainly by self-employed workers who appreciate the flexibility of using a car when needed, free-floating car-sharing thrives among young men with higher incomes, whose home location is not optimally served by public transportation.
Results also suggest that the two car-sharing schemes are not only used by different customers, but also in different ways; station-based car-sharing is mostly used in situations actually requiring a car (c.f. Fig. 4), free-floating car-sharing is used when it helps save time compared to other alternatives (c.f. Fig. 3) – an effect which also appears in the WiMobil study (BMW et al., 2016).

Shanghai (AFP) – Unable to afford a car, Shanghai university student Long Yi faces a lengthy, expensive commute across his vast city but has found a solution in the car-sharing schemes quickly gaining momentum in China.
Essentially an Internet Age twist on car rentals, car-sharing is growing rapidly from virtually nothing two years ago as Chinese millennials seek more mobile lifestyles without the cost and hassle of buying cars.
Long, 20, drives himself to school for around 50 yuan ($7) using EV Card, a service launched by state-owned automaker SAIC Motor that offers compact electric vehicles sprinkled around the city, slashing his travel time and at one-quarter the cost of taxis.
“It is cheaper and more convenient and very flexible. I would choose EV CARD as my primary way of transportation almost every time,” said Long.


After years of skyrocketing sales, the global auto industry is contemplating a sales slowdown as it convenes this week for the Shanghai Auto Show, putting alternative sales channels like car-sharing in focus.
Long-established in Western countries, car-sharing schemes are relatively new in China, but are a growing component of an ongoing Chinese personal-mobility revolution.
Drivers typically use a smartphone app to find and even unlock cars, later parking them anywhere or at set locations.
Already, bike-sharing businesses have exploded across China, flooding major cities with bicycles that are unlocked by GPS using an app, can be left anywhere and have become critical to the commutes of countless Chinese urbanites.
Dozens of Chinese and foreign companies have now either launched or invested in car-sharing businesses, with some making purpose-built cars.
Germany-based consultancy Roland Berger forecasts car-sharing will grow annually by 45 percent.
“That is a significant growth opportunity (for manufacturers). There are only a few hundred thousand cars now, but it’s growing and it’s growing very quickly,” said Johan Karlberg, a Shanghai-based partner with Roland Berger.
– Driving new sales –
German giant Daimler launched car-sharing services in the southwestern city of Chongqing a year ago and has since expanded to six other cities, with more than 250,000 registered users, the company said.
Jochem Heizmann, China CEO for Volkswagen, the country’s top car brand, told reporters Tuesday VW was close to cementing a partnership with Chinese car-sharing operator Shouqi serving multiple cities — partly to boost sales of VW electric vehicles.
“You have to see the development of such fleets as sales channels,” he stressed.
Some models are emerging with sharing features installed.
Lynk & Co — a new subsidiary of Chinese automaker Geely, which owns Volvo –- will unveil in Shanghai an SUV with electronic features that facilitate “sharing” the car to other drivers for a fee, much like renting out a flat on AirBnb.
“These types of services will grow to the extent they change to a degree the type of car you build,” said Bill Russo, head of Shanghai-based auto consultancy Gao Feng.
“You may build them to entertain people in the backseat, or to provide more connectivity so people can be productive. We’ll see this segment influence specifications.”
China’s central government and many local authorities are keen to reduce congestion and air pollution and have dangled various financial incentives, including eased licensing requirements, guaranteed parking, and other inducements.
Further working in car-sharing’s favour, countless Chinese face significant hurdles to car ownership, including cost, scarce parking, and limits on car use in several major cities.
By 2020, China will have just 195 million cars for 355 million licensed drivers, Roland Berger estimates.
“Many middle class families that can afford a second car are opting not to. It’s a real hassle,” said Karlberg.
The problem, say analysts, is that high start-up costs and other hurdles in the fledgling industry mean that no one is making money yet.
But they add that within the next two years the growing numbers of industry entrants will likely consolidate into a solid few able to run sustainable business models in partnership with local authorities.

We are a group of Strategic analysts with extensive knowledge in new technologies, new business models and innovative entrepreneurship. We truly believe that the same concept of change has changed and we try to find an answer to the following question:
Are we changing as fast as the world around us? 
Companies lose their relevance when the rate of internal change lags the pace of external change. Good strategies get supplanted by better strategies when newcomers invent more efficient ways of meeting customer needs. This is the reason why we decided to focus and analyze in depth all that sort of things that are changing at an exponential pace and try to forecast were the world is going to. According to the physics, a system is defined as chaotic when it becomes impossible to know where it will be next. There is no predictability; the system never is in the same place twice. But as a chaos theory shows, if we look at such a system long enough and with the perspective of time, it always demonstrates its inherent orderliness. In short, the most chaotic of system never goes beyond certain boundaries. We agree with Macchiavelli when he wrote (The Prince) that …Because the Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do, who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for which they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable…
Sharing economy is one of those things that are accelerating the change. Today we share houses, bikes, offices, restaurants, bikes, ridings, etc. and we predict that the era of “Apocalypse Park” has already started. We imagine a future where we don’t own a car anymore.  Car sharing will be part of our life and it will be normal as just calling a taxi. We imagine a future where cars are at home and cities are free again of smog, CO2 emission, etc. We imagine a future where parking spaces are transformed in green areas and parks. And this is our dream, and we are working to get there.

Access to mobility will take precedence over using personal vehicles for multiple purposes on a regular basis. In an exclusive chat with BW Businessworld, Vishnu Mathur, director general, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), said ride-hailing services offered by Ola, Uber, etc, will change the face of urban mobility in India.
Edited excerpts:

How has the last financial year been for the auto industry? What are your current projections and what trends are you foreseeing?
During the last financial year, we have witnessed growth in most of the segments barring commercial vehicles. In the two-wheeler space, there has been a dip in motorcycle sales since its large exposure to rural market. The urban market has revived and so has scooter sales. The private vehicles (PV) industry has done reasonably well. We also hope that the commercial vehicles industry does well too in the coming few months. The key trend that I foresee in the PV space is that utility vehicles are growing very handsomely. People who were planning to buy sedans are gravitating towards compact SUVs, which are like crossovers.
The Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Bill 2016, which seeks to usher in reforms in the transport sector, has just been passed by the Lok Sabha. What are the key takeaways from it?
We are very happy that the law is through and we welcome it wholeheartedly. This is probably the first time that the safety aspect has been looked at in a holistic manner and all stakeholders of the society have been taken into consideration. Everyone, whether they are manufacturers, government, road users, road designers, etc will be held accountable.


It is also looking into the aftermarket vertical whether it is pertaining to inspection, maintenance and services. Furthermore, road rules in states would be made more cohesive, uniform and standard. For example, wearing a helmet for two-wheeler riders would be mandatory across the country. Now, there is a clearance to pave the way for a vehicle recall policy. With this coming in, there will be clauses that will enable the government to have a mandatory recall policy also. We are very positive as there is could make a huge difference for road safety in the country.

The recent Supreme Court verdict on ban on BS-IV registrations have the entire industry in a tizzy. How have the key players been able to resolve it when it comes to unsold inventory at their dealers’ end?
Firstly, there are 150,000 vehicles of various segments that are lying unsold in the country. Moreover, the vehicles that were sold on 30-31 March have not been registered by the road transport office. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are looking at alternative options such exports after finetuning the vehicles to suit their requirements. The other option is getting the vehicles’ engines replaced with a BS-IV compliant engine at OEM sites.
With the influx of shared mobility, do you think there will be some impact on vehicle registrations?
The influx of cab aggregators such Ola, Uber, etc., will change the face of how mobility takes place in the country. It is very difficult to say whether this is going to reduce the number of vehicles in the country because personal mobility requirements will continue to remain. A person may not use a vehicle on a regular basis. The only thing that will happen is better utilisation of the fleet.

For example, I may use a personal car for a couple of hours while commuting but the vehicle is lying idle for the rest of time. That may not be the usage pattern in the future. We also have to see whether those vehicles will remain as internal combustion engines or move on to higher technologies like hybrids.

Since BS-VI emission norms will be uniformly applicable across the country by 2020, what proactive steps is the industry taking to avert any déjà vu when it comes to vehicle registrations? Also, will there be a ripple effect on the used car market? 
The BS-IV fuel had come progressively since 2010. It was a question of ramping up those technologies and making the right kind of vehicles available in the market. In the case of 2020, we are leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI emission norms. The BS-VI compliant fuel will not be available before 1 April 2020 and thus the technologies, which have to be tested, validated and certified for Indian conditions, are not there.

It is impossible to lift technologies from overseas markets and deploy it here because of the variation in climatic conditions, driving cycles, road conditions, etc. Moreover, all these activities are not done by OEMs but global solution providers such as Bosch, Delphi, Denso, Continental, etc. So, bringing in BS-VI technologies to the entire gamut of vehicles in three years is itself a huge challenge. If the registration of BS-VI vehicles is disallowed, their production should kick off prior to that. But, they cannot leave the factory because fuel is not available.

In response to the second part of your question, only new registrations (of used vehicles) get affected. For instance, if I have a 10-year old BS-III vehicle and want to dispose it off, I will not be able to sell it to anyone based in Lucknow because that city will not register a BS-III vehicle. But I can sell it off to anyone in Delhi because it is a mere change in name (of the owner).

Four years after the introduction of City CarShare in the San Francisco, Bay area in California, 29% of carshare members had gotten rid of one or more cars, and 4.8% of members’ trips and 5.4% of their vehicle miles traveled were in carshare vehicles. Matched-pair comparisons with a statistical control group suggest that, over time, members have reduced total vehicular travel. However, most declines occurred during the first 1 to 2 years of the program; 3 to 4 years after City CarShare’s inauguration, earlier declines had leveled off. Because many carshare vehicles are small and fuel-efficient but can carry several people, the trend in per capita gasoline consumption also is downward. Mindful of the cumulative costs of driving, carshare members appear to have become more judicious and selective when deciding whether to drive, take public transit, walk, bike, or even forgo a trip. Coupled with reduced personal car ownership, these factors have given rise to a resourceful form of automobility in the San Francisco Bay area.

PRISMS focused on developing intelligent in-vehicle technology and analytical tools to reduce the barriers to the use of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in car sharing services and fleets.
The project was undertaken by Urban Foresight in collaboration with Co-Wheels and Route Monkey following a successful application to the Low Emission Transport Collaborative Projects Fund.
Car sharing schemes, known as ‘car clubs’ in the UK are increasingly becoming an important part of urban transport systems. They have also become a proving ground for low emission vehicles such as hybrid and full electric vehicles. High utilisation means these vehicles offer opportunities to achieve significant emissions reductions and to give multiple members of the public the experience of driving electric vehicles for the first time and to build confidence in these new technologies. In addition, increased use of shared electric vehicles are increasingly being seen by organisations as a way to reduce costs and emissions from both retained fleet and ‘grey’ fleets.
However, integrating electric vehicles into car sharing schemes present a number of technical and financial challenges. Specifically, the requirement to schedule recharging sessions throughout the day can limit the utilisation of these vehicles, as well as restrict the journeys that can be made in these vehicles.
This project set out to develop tools and business models to address this challenge and support Co-Wheels, one of the UK’s leading car sharing operators, to expand the number of electric vehicles in their nationwide fleet.
Urban Foresight’s led the research undertaken in this project which informed work done by Co-Wheels and Route Monkey developing of a vehicle-based technology package involving algorithms and analytical tools. Specifically, Urban Foresight reviewed:

The evolution of car clubs and their operational models;
Costs and practical challenges associated with operating plug-in vehicles in car clubs;
Generic factors that impact fleets’ capacity to use shared electric vehicles;
How local authorities could encourage electric carsharing; and
Intelligent mobility for carsharing and fleets.

Electric shuttles will whisk volunteers about campus while gathering data for on-demand transportation services.





Starting this month, there’s a new way for some of the MIT community to make its way around the Institute: chauffeured golf cart. Three of the diminutive, four-passenger electrical vehicles will ply the byways of West Campus, summoned, Uber-like, via a smartphone app, then plucking up passengers and depositing them at locations of their choice within a select service area.







The mobility-on-demand service is part of a collaboration between the MIT Aeronautics and Astronautics Department’s Aerospace Controls Lab (ACL) and Ford Motor Company to develop a means of predicting customer location and requests for demand transportation services, while demonstrating algorithms and methods for navigating densely crowded pedestrian areas.
“Through the mobility-on-demand system we’re developing, we can investigate new planning and prediction algorithms in a complex, but controlled, environment, while simultaneously providing a testbed framework for researchers and a service to the MIT community,” says ACL director Jonathan How, who is also the Richard Cockburn Maclaurin Professor in Aeronautics and Astronautics. ACL researches topics related to autonomous systems and control design for aircraft, spacecraft, and ground vehicles. Theoretical and experimental research is pursued in such areas as estimation and navigation, planning and learning under uncertainty, and vehicle autonomy.
Since early this year the vehicles have plied campus byways, capturing pedestrian flow via onboard LIDAR and cameras, accumulating data to help the service anticipate where the most demand for the shuttles will be at any given moment.
The LiDAR scans pinpoint the vehicles’ locations and detect the movement of nearby pedestrians, allowing researchers to log the typical movements of people across the campus each day. Accurately predicting demand based on pedestrian flows will allow the shuttles to be carefully pre-positioned and routed to serve the MIT population in the most efficient way possible. “It’s all about being in the right place at the right time,” How says.
Researchers also take other factors into account that affect the movement of pedestrians on MIT’s campus, such as varying weather conditions, class schedules, and the dynamic habits of the MIT community across different semesters.
MIT community members who have volunteered for the test will use a smartphone app to indicate where they want to be picked up and dropped off. In return, they’ll be given a pickup time estimate. If things go as anticipated, they won’t be waiting long for a ride to arrive.
The vehicles are small enough to navigate sidewalks, while leaving plenty of room for pedestrian traffic. They’re outfitted with weatherproof enclosures to shield riders from inclement weather, which will be an especially rewarding feature when fall arrives.
How says that the local ride-hailing concept may someday provide a service that fills gaps between shuttle buses, automobiles, and public transportation, and may also have application to development of fully autonomous vehicles.
How says that the mobility-on-demand service will continue throughout the winter “unless Cambridge gets hit with blizzards like those we got a couple of years ago.”

The Senseable City Lab and the transportation company Uber are launching a research initiative to explore how car- and ride-sharing networks could reshape the future of urban mobility. This initiative will explore new mobility paradigms for the 21st century, building on both parties’ data and analytics strengths.
“We all know how the ‘sharing economy’ has revolutionized many aspects of our lives. How will it challenge traditional notions of mobility and individual freedom after the advent of self-driving?” asks Carlo Ratti, professor of the practice of urban technologies and director of the Senseable City Lab. “In the United States, cars are idle 95 percent of the time, so they are an ideal candidate for the sharing economy.”
“We recognize sharing as the critical element in enabling on-demand mobility systems to deliver benefits to riders, drivers, and cities,” said Andrew Salzberg, Uber’s head of transportation policy and research. “It’s why we’ve invested so much into building uberPOOL into a successful product in over 30 cities around the world, and it’s why we’re partnering with Senseable City Lab to push the boundaries of what’s possible.” The Senseable City Lab has been pioneering research in ride sharing since its successful HubCab project in 2014.
With self-driving cars taking to the road, sharing could potentially increase significantly. A shared self-driving car could give you a lift to work in the morning and then, rather than sitting idle in a parking lot, provide a ride to someone else in your family — or to someone else in the neighborhood. According to MIT’s research, this could theoretically lead to a city where everyone could travel on demand with just one-fifth of the number of cars in use today. Analysis of the data collected by Uber through its global operations will produce better estimates of the impact of car and ride sharing around the world.
This collaboration will study mobility and the ability to share rides on a global scale. The comparative analysis of data collected in various cities will enable the exploration of impactful questions for the first time, such as: What is the effect of a city’s size on shareability? Is it easier to share a trip in a large city or small city? Do social, economic, and cultural aspects influence mobility patterns and thus sharing potential?
Understanding the patterns that facilitate or prevent the sharing of vehicles and trips is critical to understanding the path toward more energy-efficient, environmentally friendly, and equitable urban form — a goal that MIT and Uber share.
Paolo Santi, visiting scientist, will direct the project on MIT’s side. Team members will include Mohammad Vazifeh, Giovanni Resta, and Thomas Matarazzo.

The 1st launch of mobility services in North America is through Free2Move, PSA Group’s mobility brand and its partner Travelcar, a start-up founded in 2012. The car sharing service for travellers will be 1st available in Los Angeles airport starting from April 3rd 2017 before a larger deployment in the United States. This offer is designed to optimize cars ensuring they rarely go unused, providing advantageous solutions to car owners (free or advantageous-price parking in addition to the benefit from the rent) and to car users (rental price approx. 50% less expensive than with a traditional car rental offer).
PSA North America with initial task of developing the mobility services with the Group’s partners will start developing these projects. The following step is to develop mobility solutions with PSA Group’s cars, before marketing vehicles directly in North America, identifying regional sourcing opportunities when appropriate; as per the “Push to Pass” plan unveiled on 6 April 2016.
Larry Dominique is appointed Senior Vice President & Head of the North American entity. He has over 30 years of experience in the U.S. automotive industry, having worked at General Motors, Chrysler, Nissan – and most recently- serving as President of Automotive Lease Guide (ALG) and Executive Vice President of TrueCar.
PSA North American entity reports PSA Group’s Corporate Planning and Programs, led by Executive Vice President Patrice Lucas.
“With the creation of PSA North American entity, PSA Group makes an important step forward in the roll-out of our project to progressively enter the region” said Carlos Tavares, Chairman of the Managing Board. “Moving forward, we will ramp up our mobility activities and the development of car-sharing services, among other efforts. Today we start with our partner TravelCar.”
