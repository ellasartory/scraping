An autonomous vehicle, also known as a driverless vehicle refers to a self-driving vehicle with an ability to sense. These vehicles use a fully automated driving system that is capable of responding to external conditions that a human driver can manage. Compared to manually-driven cars, autonomous vehicles have other advantages apart from being environmentally friendly. They reduce the risk of vehicle crashes as its software is designed to make fewer mistakes, reduce road congestion that comes with irresponsible driving, and allow people with disabilities to drive to places. It also reduces driver fatigue and makes overnight journeys easy.
With many tech giants such as Apple, Toyota, Google, and Tesla exploring this new technology, these are the trends that make anticipating the future exciting.
The First Level 5 Autonomous Car: The development of an autonomous car is divided into five stages and with the currency developments, manufacturers are hopeful for a level 5 car.

A Completely Unassisted Drive: Going on a road trip in a totally technology-run vehicle will soon be possible, thanks to automation.
Autonomous Trucking will become a Reality: Autonomous driving technology is set to transform the logistics industry as well with self-driving trucks.
Autonomous Ride-Sharing: The future doesn’t just involve owning a self-driving car, but also using autonomous car fleets for ride-sharing, reducing the dependency on fuel, and being good for the planet.
Diverse autonomous features: It’s not just the navigation that autonomous technology will boost, other automatic features like in-car virtual assistants and AR features will be an add-on.

More than 50 organizations agree to make shared mobility the first, best choice over private car use.
Nearly
 50 public, private and nonprofit organizations announced a major 
initiative to develop and advance the Shared Mobility Action Agenda so 
that by 2030, equitable, low-carbon shared mobility will be more 
convenient, more practical, more available, easier to use and more 
accessible and affordable than driving a car. 
“The gas price 
spike has – again – made many of us painfully aware of our overreliance 
on cars. While electrification is necessary, it’s not enough to solve 
our systemic mobility problems,” said Benjamin de la Peña, CEO of the 
Shared-Use Mobility Center. “The Agenda and Action Network intend to 
make shared mobility the first and best option over car ownership within
 the decade. We need to do this to fight climate change, make mobility 
more equitable, and to help households save money. This isn’t just 
another sign-on document. We’ve developed a to-do list to actually get 
it done.” 
This is a pivotal moment for the future of 
transportation. Low-income households spend almost 40 percent of their 
income on transportation. Shared-Use Mobility Center (SUMC) says the 
latest research shows that the nation is running out of time to take 
bold action on the climate crisis. The number of people killed by 
drivers nationwide while walking increased almost 50 percent over the 
last decade, and more of the victims were older adults and people of 
color, says SUMC. 
“Shared mobility strategies can deliver on the 
promise of safer roads, more equitable transportation, and the 
sustainable movement of people and goods – if done right. That’s why 
we’re here,” said Marla Westervelt, vice president of policy at 
Coalition for Reimagined Mobility. “Coming together with an influential 
network of public, private and community advocates, we can collaborate 
and act to shape the transportation of tomorrow and address the current 
global energy security and climate crises.” 
More than 50 public, 
private and non-profit organizations have already committed to advancing
 the agenda, which supports all shared transportation options, from 
public transportation to ride-hail, from car-sharing to on-demand 
responsive microtransit, from shared bikes and scooters to paratransit. 
In advance of the release of version 1.0 of the agenda later this 
summer, the immediate goal is to continue to grow the number of 
participating organizations and gain even more momentum. 
“As
 the global leader in TransitTech, we believe in a world where everyone 
has access to efficient, affordable mobility. The cost of car ownership 
is higher than many families can afford, but far too often is the only 
way to access jobs, education and healthcare. Technology to make transit
 flexible and shared can help all types of communities -from rural towns
 to big cities increase economic opportunity for their residents while 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” said Hind Ourahou, Mobility Policy 
principal at Via. 
The International Energy Association finds that
 having more shared rides and using more public transportation and 
micromobility can reduce global oil consumption by as much as 800,000 
barrels per day, which is nearly 300 million barrels per year, saving 
money and reducing harmful air pollutants. 
“The devil is always 
in the details,” said Kevin Chambers, founder and principal of Full Path
 Transit Technology. “There are so many ways that shared mobility can be
 done wrong. Getting so many organizations and individuals with 
different perspectives together to collaborate on the best paths forward
 will help ensure we make measurable advances on shared mobility. A 
priority for me has been making sure that the agenda includes the needs 
of rural and community-based mobility services.” 
Another  benefit of moving to shared mobility is communities can stop ceding  valuable property to parking lots and highways and adding to existing  maintenance deficits on miles and miles of land currently dedicated to  moving and accommodating cars. The agenda aims to ensure we maximize the  benefits of making shared mobility more convenient than driving a car.

 Integrating on-demand microtransit options into existing services allows agencies to better serve communities with affordable, convenient public transit, promoting economic mobility. 
By Kellie Meilleur



Nearly 70 percent of all Americans who depend on the bus for their transportation needs make less than $50,000 per year. This, according to a report by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), validates that lower-income individuals rely more heavily on public transportation than those who are earn higher incomes. 
Across the nation, more and more transit agencies and cities are turning to on-demand microtransit service to expand and improve public transportation options for low-income residents. 
What exactly is microtransit? Simply, microtransit is dynamic routing. It takes mobile smartphone apps and puts them to use to create an efficient mode of transport that adapts with each passenger’s trip needs. At the click of a button, passengers can book a trip that will take them on the quickest route to their desired destination.  
A distinctive aspect of microtransit, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, is that it is “a privately owned and operated shared transportation system that can offer fixed routes and schedules, as well as flexible routes and on-demand scheduling. The vehicles generally include vans and buses.” 
Microtransit can be easily accessible and highly efficient anda ‘no-brainer’ for many lower income individuals who can’t afford to own a car and have therefore been greatly underserved by traditional transit networks.
When COVID-19 first hit, a majority of higher income earners began working from home and using their personal vehicles for necessary travel. On the far end of the spectrum, millions of lower-income Americans didn’t have the same luxury or opportunity. They needed to get to and from their jobs and other destinations, despite sweeping changes in how transportation options had changed and disadvantaged many since the pandemic.  
That’s where microtransit in its many forms came into play, and in a big way. 
Many transit agencies, anxious to serve their most underserved customers and plug the gap between traditional fixed-route transportation and more individual transportation options, are offering riders fast and convenient ways to book their trips.  
Microtransit has proven to be a mobility lifeline. Amid the many shutdowns we have all experienced, on-demand transit has pivoted to serve specific community needs, such as food delivery to our most vulnerable community members and transporting hospital and other frontline workers to their jobs, even in the overnight hours. In fact, APTA’s data shows that dynamic, on-demand public transit has proven to be a mobility lifeline for those in low-income areas during this crisis.
Transit industry expert, thought leader and influencer Paul Comfort recently hosted a podcast segment on his show, Comfort’s Corner, about the role of microtransit for equity and inclusion. As a thought leader in the public transportation space, Comfort sees public transportation’s role as one to improve equity and inclusion for those who need it most.First, it was for the elderly and those with mobility challenges, and now, it’s for those who are underserved.
Comfort believes that microtransit is the hottest trend to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. When the pandemic hit, transportation providers made major changes to their service based on changing ridership demand and to adhere to health and safety requirements. This included altering transit routes and changing the frequency of trips. These changes immediately impacted those who had no other means of getting from point A to point B. The silver lining is that microtransit has been the solution to the transit shortage problem. Comfort explains that “microtransit fills the transit gaps, and it ensures that no one gets left behind.”  
The great news is that the stop-gap solution that microtransit provides is here to stay. Significant data across several U.S. cities has recently been gathered suggesting that microtransit has been a vital public resource for lower-income individuals since the start of the pandemic. This information, along with insights shared by transit thought leaders like Comfort, help the transportation industry to look ahead to the long-term need for microtransit as part of the equity and inclusion solution. 
By joining the microtransit movement and integrating on-demand options into existing public transit infrastructure, transit providers across the country can better serve their communities with affordable, convenient public transportation and promote economic mobility for all.

Bringing
 items to the end consumer is as old as civilization, but many delivery 
firms and retail partners are in search of a profitable model
By Brian Straight

Many
 assume that last-mile delivery arose alongside the rapid growth of 
e-commerce. That narrative is simply false. Household moving companies 
have long considered themselves the final mile of delivery. Before them,
 there was the milkman, common in the early 1900s, who brought fresh 
dairy products to consumer doorsteps.
Lyft, Uber, et al seemed to 
change the game, though, but even their independent contractor-based 
businesses are not unique. During the Roman Empire, items reached eager 
citizens through cursus publicus
 (Latin for “the public way”). The system was a state-run courier and 
transportation system that utilized everyday citizens called mancipes, 
aka contractors, to transport food, animals and equipment.
The 
last mile is not new, but it is behaving very much like a startup 
company, seeing rapid growth in the last few years and now, perhaps, 
transitioning into its next phase — sustainability.
Last mile looks for balance
“The market will find a more natural equilibrium,” Guy Bloch, CEO of delivery technology firm Bringg,
 told Modern Shipper. “Today, what is done with market funding, now it 
will find a more equilibrium [of investment]. To really do it well and 
always find the most efficient driver to satisfy your customer at a 
margin that works for you, you need to digitize.”
The last mile is
 going through change and doing so rapidly. Like a startup company that 
invested heavily in scaling before trying to find its true profitability
 model, the last mile is now looking to find its equilibrium — that 
perfect mix of providers, technology and customer service.
According to ShipBob, 73% of shoppers
 expect affordable, fast deliveries when ordering online. But what is 
affordable to the customer is not always affordable to the shipper. A 
2021 Gartner report found that retailers with 50% or more of their sales
 coming from online channels saw logistics costs 50% above those of 
retailers with primarily in-store sales.
A
 report from Precedence Research said the last-mile delivery 
transportation market was $179.96 billion in 2021 and will grow to 
$423.3 billion by 2030.
Free shipping declines
Clearly,
 there is opportunity ahead. And it’s possible — in fact even likely — 
that what is happening today is just a preview of the changes to come. A
 Gartner analysis of 500 leading retailers found there has been a 12.5% decline
 in the number of retailers offering free shipping and a 30% reduction 
in those offering free shipping on returns between late 2019 and August 
2020. 
“What we used to see was subsidization of last-mile  delivery by gig fleets and now we see that relaxing so the market will  be more competitive,” Bloch said. “Gig is the new way of continuing [to  service the customer] and we see what used to be standard shipping  over the years start to move to local delivery. A year or  two years ago, the gig fleets subsidized a lot of the adoption. … What  we are going to see is it will be less subsidized than before.”
Two  recent reports on the state of the last mile have previewed some of the  changes, and real-world feedback from one of the globe’s largest  retailers highlights the struggles brands are facing in meeting this new  demand.
Omnichannel demands grow
“Logistics
 and delivery providers are trying to meet the growing demand for 
competitive omnichannel delivery services demanded by shippers and end 
customers, including same-day delivery, ship-from-store and returns. 
These require greater speed, and agility, and often a restructuring of 
resources, technologies and operational processes,” the report noted.
In
 a survey of 200 logistics and transportation leaders from North America
 and Europe, the report found that 68% of respondents already offered 
same-day delivery or will do so by the end of this year, and 27% believe
 offering returns (which can be as high as 30% of online orders) and 
pickup services provide a strategic advantage.
Still, connectivity
 is a major roadblock, with 44% citing shipper onboarding and 
integration of carriers as an operational pain point, and 44% also 
saying visibility into outsourced delivery partners is an issue. Another
 41% said carrier and driver management were issues.
The Roman 
mancipes simply commandeered wagons and other needs along the way, but 
today’s last-mile delivery network is a bit more sophisticated.
“[The
 industry] is calling and screaming for technology to kick in,” Bloch 
said. “It’s a big change. It’s a major force that none of us control in 
finding the equilibrium.”
Bloch went on to say that he expects 
companies to start acting more strategically in developing their 
last-mile delivery strategies.
“Based on the needs of the market, retailers are perfecting [their strategies] in different ways,” he said.
American Eagle logistics flies high
Global American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) is one of those companies. In 2021, AEO (NYSE: AEO) acquired both AirTerra and Quiet Logistics,
 the former being a logistics technology company and the latter being a 
third-party logistics provider that services omnichannel needs for more 
than 50 brands.
The acquisitions were merged into Quiet Platforms. In its latest earnings release
 on Friday, the outfitter said that its supply chain acquisitions 
contributed about 3 percentage points to the company’s 2% revenue growth
 in Q1.
In an April webinar for project44, Bill Besselman, senior 
vice president of supply chain execution at AEO, said a rethinking of 
the company’s supply chain is helping it manage the last mile.
“When
 we thought about the last mile, we realized the last mile wasn’t a mile
 at all, it was 1,300 miles,” he said. “Thirteen hundred miles was a 
barrier for two reasons — one is speed, and the other is cost. We needed
 to rethink the supply chain.”
Besselman went on to say that AEO 
realized it needed to relocate merchandise closer to the end consumer to
 shorten inbound times to stores and delivery times to customers, but 
that the diversification of the last-mile carrier market was creating 
new challenges.
“There is an opportunity for us as midsized 
retailers and brands to get after these problems differently than what 
we have done in the past,” he said.
Brittle supply chains
“One
 of the things we learned during the pandemic is that supply chains are 
very brittle and they are not very successful [if something breaks],” 
Besselman added, noting that 58% of AEO transactions now take place 
online. “Carrier selection is incredibly important to us. [Different] 
carriers allow us to offer different services.”
That is a point 
that Bloch repeated, pointing to the relaxing of subsidies to fund the 
last mile leading to more competition in the space as logistics 
providers look for sustainable and profitable paths forward.
“We are going through a major transformation and what we all [thought] in theory [is no more],” he said.
“The
 way I look at it, we are about to finish the first wave of COVID, the 
reactive wave,” Bloch added. “The consumer hasn’t gone back to the 
pre-COVID days, they got rewired. Now we are flipping to the second wave
 and the second wave is how do you build a robust infrastructure [to 
sustain e-commerce and last-mile delivery].”
A significant portion of a sustainable last mile involves ways to better manage returns.
“My
 perspective is if you want to play in the online game, which is 
different than the offline game, part of that is returns,” Bloch said. 
“Returns hurt the margins of the business. What I see more retailers do 
is find creative ways to manage returns.”
And more providers are jumping into the returns game. In March, DoorDash (NYSE: DASH) announced it was testing a returns program that allowed its drivers to pick up returns at a customer’s home and deliver it to the nearest FedEx, UPS or post office. Unicorn upstart Veho is also testing a returns program, as are others.
Returns offer a path to profitability
Bloch said services like returns are part of the evolution of the last-mile delivery space.
“Once
 it’s democratized, once it’s digitized, once it’s connected, you can 
start developing flows that serve your business,” he said.
The 
last-mile delivery wheels are spinning, and it is technology powering 
the revolution. The Bringg survey found that for businesses struggling 
with managing last-mile delivery vehicles and providers, only 22% use 
efficiency solutions such as automated order batching or auto dispatch 
and routing. Just 27% of logistics providers offer self-scheduling.
Driver
 wages are also an issue, with 65% saying they are paying drivers more 
in 2022 than they did in 2021, but 38% say driver satisfaction and 
retention remain issues. For an industry that depends on gig drivers 
able to work for any platform on a given day, wages may play an outsized
 role.
“The more the market becomes competitive, the more we will 
need to increase wages,” Bloch said. “As we continue the next couple of 
years and find the equilibrium, we will see more and more fleets 
increase wages. Remember, these drivers are 1099 [workers] so they can 
work for you or another company, and many work for multiple platforms. 
What’s important is to bring competition into the market.”
Ultimately, the progression of the last mile is being driven by one factor that Besselman explained in his presentation.
“We  are excited about the customer experience opportunity because supply  chain has emerged from the back to a customer-centric function,” he  said.

 On-demand transit projects that started before COVID-19 have led to robust ridership and speak to innovation that the public will need in a post-COVID world, according to experts during an event last week. 
By Skip Descant


On-demand transit projects that started before COVID-19 have led to robust ridership and speak to innovation that the public will need in a post-COVID world, according to experts during an event last week.

“From the start of the pandemic, the public transportation industry pivoted to meet a new world of never-before-seen challenges,” said Paul Skoutelas, president and CEO of the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) during a July 28 press briefing. “Innovation became survival.”
APTA organized the briefing to underscore transit innovation during the pandemic and to present a new report titled “Mobility Innovation: The Case for Federal Investment and Support.”
The case studies in the report explore how various transit systems have structured, launched and pivoted on-demand projects. In most cases, the on-demand projects aim to bring transit opportunities to areas where few options exist. These areas are often suburban locations with low-density housing. But in some instances, bigger cities seek to improve their available transportation, as with a project in St. Petersburg, Fla., where the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA) partnered with transportation network companies (TNCs) and taxis to provide late-night transportation for service workers.
In many cases, the arrangements depend on partnerships with private mobility providers. When the pandemic reshuffled all forms of normal American life, transit started serving communities in often unorthodox ways. In Los Angeles, an on-demand program launched as a first-mile, last-mile solution through a partnership with Via. The program’s initial idea was to connect riders with transit stations. During the pandemic, the program, in addition to providing rides, morphed into a food delivery service for residents in need.
“When you have a partnership based on innovation, you can adjust that partnership to fit the needs of the moment,” said Joshua Schank, chief innovation officer for L.A. Metro, at the briefing. “And then it’s not a one-time thing. There are crises all the time. Different things come in and affect what you plan on doing. Being able to adjust is a lot easier when you’re working in an innovation culture and with an innovative team in the first place.”
The program with Via is now fully integrated within the L.A. Metro system as part of the Metro Micro program, an on-demand service Metro provides with its own operators.
“That means we now have a much larger pilot program for on-demand services,” said Schank.
The food delivery service has continued.
“People still need to get to essential food. And this could potentially be a mobility option that saves us trips by reducing the number of times people are going to and from places,” he added.
Before the pandemic, a similar on-demand program kicked off in Flint, Mich., and provided 13,000 rides a month. The program is now expected to provide some 20,000 to 25,000 rides a month, said Ed Benning, general manager and CEO of Mass Transportation Authority (MTA) Flint.
“So the need is very strong,” said Benning.
Another on-demand program in the Kansas City, Kan., area uses a seven-vehicle county-owned fleet. But the project also includes a partnership with a local taxi service, which can flex into the system and pick up some of the demand to cut down on wait times.
“In my mind that’s kind of the secret sauce that makes the microtransit program in Johnson County work,” said Josh Powers, business liaison for Johnson County, Kan.
Microtransit ridership is at 150 percent of pre-COVID levels, said Powers. The service provides more than 8,000 rides a month. Month by month, this number continues to increase.
Skoutelas remarked that transit is frequently seen as an “industry that’s slow to change.” However, this viewpoint overlooks the reality that a lot of change is happening in the transit world.
“[W]e need to bring attention to that,” he said. “And we want to share it as widely as we can.”

Across Europe, as cities get to grips with road congestion, air pollution and meeting climate targets, the manual and electric cargo bike is rapidly delivering. Nimble, clean and efficient in urban settings, the cargo bike is quickly becoming the default transport choice for logistics companies, food delivery services and even plumbers.
‘Cargo bikes’ is a catch-all phrase for bicycles that are adapted to carry heavier or bulkier loads, or even passengers and children. For cities, the cargo bike presents a win-win at an important turning point as e-commerce companies and food delivery services continue their dizzying rise. The humble cargo bike presents businesses with a way to increase urban deliveries, improve the speed and reliability of those deliveries, while removing diesel-fuelled delivery vans from urban roads.
A recent study from climate charity and Rapid Transition Alliance member, Possible, found that electric cargo bikes deliver 60% faster than vans in urban centres, totting up higher average speeds and dropping off ten parcels an hour, compared to a van’s six. The same report found that cargo bikes cut emissions by 90% compared with diesel vans and by a third when compared with electric vans.
Cargo bikes have also revolutionised the urban school run, with some holding up to eight children becoming an increasingly  common sight in Denmark, the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, London. The result is less congested roads, more breathable air, fewer road traffic accidents, a radical drop in carbon emissions and a flourishing ecosystem of businesses that can go direct to their customers without harming the environment.
And, the cargo bike market is booming. In Germany, nearly 100,000 e-cargo bikes are sold every year, with its neighbour France ratcheting up around 50,000 sales a year. The UK is a little behind, totting up only 2,000 e-cargo bike sales for commercial use last year. But, this is only set to be temporary, with sales expected to jump by 60% this year and a market size set to increase by 15-fold within the next five years. This rate of growth is set to be mirrored across Europe too, with sales expected to increase by 50% year on year. By 2030, estimates suggest annual European sales of one million cargo bikes for commercial uses and a further one million sales for family cargo bikes.
Wider relevance
The coming age of the cargo bike provides a fascinating insight into rapid transition – and is one that can be replicated in other sectors if we can get all the ingredients right. A combination of private enterprise, government support, design and manufacturing breakthroughs, standardisation and cross-border collaboration have created the conditions where both the demand for cargo bikes, and the supply coming to market, are on an inexorable rise. Alongside these factors has been the enabling power of digital technology, where app-based platforms and digital bike-sharing schemes are increasing the accessibility to cargo bikes for city dwellers, boosting demand and visibility.
While enabled by high-tech manufacturing and improvements in battery technology, the cargo bike craze sweeping across Europe can also be understood as an effective, relatively low-tech climate solution, reorienting transport away from the fossil fuelled-vehicles towards low-impact, low-cost and long-term solutions which have multiple additional benefits. At a time when technologies – both those available and those yet to be invented – often receive disproportionate attention in climate policy debates, the rise of cargo bikes can remind us of how some of the smartest, most easily deployed tools for transition are those that we already have: they are tried and tested.
Scaling up cargo bikes in urban centres can also help lay the foundations for other low-carbon and clean air initiatives, as well as countering the worrying trend of increased car use induced by pandemic fears of using public transport. By providing a solution for industry and businesses to access their customer base and move through urban spaces without the need for cars and vans, cargo bikes can become a enabler for Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs), reducing the allocation of road space for cars which can allow pop-up gardens and Playful Streets to emerge throughout cities, where communities can play without fearing traffic. In a post-pandemic world, where the necessity of e-commerce and food delivery services are perhaps here to stay, finding ways of getting goods from A to B in a sustainable fashion is vital.
There is also a broader economic relevance, where the rising demand for cargo bikes is boosting employment in industrial heartlands. The iconic UK-based bike manufacturer, Raleigh, has only been selling cargo bikes for a few years, but they have already seen their sales increase by 75% last year at their Nottingham manufacturing facility. Raleigh recently partnered with another UK institution – the National Trust – to deploy cargo bikes at their larger sites to help with maintenance and moving supplies around. Raleigh have also partnered with the family dairy company, Jones Bros, providing them with cargo bikes for their London deliveries, replacing the diesel van they used to use for their 10-mile delivery route. With cargo bikes, we are seeing a rich array of collaborations between manufacturers and businesses, who are running pilots to garner an understanding how both their business offerings and bottom lines can be improved by the introduction of cargo bikes.
Context and background
Cargo bikes present an opportunity and solution for both local governments and businesses. Cities around the world are grappling with the issue of poisonous air, where an increase in motor traffic and congestion in urban centres is creating air which is a danger to human health – especially the health of children. Globally, air pollution kills an estimated seven million people a year. In the UK, noxious air is responsible for approximately 40,000 deaths per year. Getting cars off the roads and out of densely populated urban areas is therefore a priority for cities – and reducing the number of larger, diesel-fuelled delivery vans is the best place to start. According to data from the Department for Transport, van traffic in London has grown by 71% over the last two decades, with 47% of the 3.8 million vans registered since 1996 attributed to businesses. In London, it’s estimated that up to 14% of small van journeys in the most congested parts of the city could be made with cargo bikes. In Dublin, postal giant UPS has been trialling a cargo bike hub approach, where two e-trikes have replaced four delivery vans, removing around 500 van-delivered packages from their supply chain and cutting their Dublin-based emissions by 40%.
At the same time, the demand for e-commerce goods, food delivery services and other platform-based, convenience-fuelled ventures are clogging up urban centres with traffic, noise and making the air unbreathable. For e-commerce especially, the roaring demand for same day and next day delivery is causing logistics giants a major headache, causing them to pour in billions of investment into so-called last-mile delivery services. And while venture capitalist and techo-futurists would have you believe that autonomous postal robots are just around the corner, it is the humble cargo bike that’s allowing e-commerce to unlock the last mile puzzle. Some estimates of the financial benefits to businesses range from 70-90% cost savings compared to reliance on delivery vans. Plus, it’s not just the likes of Amazon and UPS getting on their bikes, national postal services are filling up the cargo bike manufacturers’ order books too. Ireland’s national postal service, An Post, recently ordered over 100 e-trikes from the German manufacturer Radkutsche.
The cargo bike craze is a great example of how the co-benefits of rapid transition can quickly align.
Enabling factors
Support from Government and business
The cargo bike craze has been fostered, in part, by a strong policy toolkit across Europe, ranging from local government grants and national subsidies to private business offerings. In the UK, the Department for Transport (DfT) launched their eCargo Bike Grant Fund for businesses and organisations in 2019 and has already awarded over £2 million in grants. In fact, the grant scheme has unlocked such a vast amount of demand for cargo bikes that in 2020, 58 councils across the UK submitted bids totalling £4.2 million – creating a positive problem for the UK to fill these grants to get the wheels in motion.
The business improvement district, Team London Bridge, is currently running a business engagement strategy that has been hugely successful. As part of the programme, Team London Bridge contacts businesses and organisations active with the London Bridge area and helps them bring cargo bikes into their everyday operations in order to capture the numerous benefits. In the Netherlands, a country famed for its cycling culture, the tech-firm Cargoroo has launched an app-based public cargo bike share scheme so everyone can benefit from the cargo bike.
Standardisation for safety
Despite cycling being around for hundreds of years, the cargo bike is something that is relatively modern. And as the sales of cargo bikes boom across Europe, manufacturers and industrial groups are busy creating a European cargo bike standard, which was launched last year. While there are already national standards in France and Germany, the regional growth in the cargo bike market is causing manufacturers to push for greater standardisation across the board. At the front of everyone’s minds is safety – but there are divergent opinions on issues such as bike width, payload and length. Once an agreement is reached, manufacturers will have the certainty they need to push ahead with boosting supply.
The commercial opportunity 
There are plenty of financial gains from deploying cargo bikes throughout a businesses’ supply chain. From reducing the overheads of entering low emissions zones, or the mounting parking fines that many companies face, to having the speed and agility to glide through traffic or even reach areas that motorised vehicles can’t, cargo bikes look like a no-brainer for many firms operating in this space. And it’s not just logistics firms and e-commerce giants who are hopping on the cargo bike craze, many businesses that have to transfer goods as part of their service provision are exploring the potential of cargo bikes: be they plumbers, ice cream vendors or window cleaners.
Cross-city collaboration & advocacy
Alongside cross-border standardisation, comes a deeper form of collaboration. Organisations like the EU-funded CityChangerCaroBike have been expanding to partner cities all over Europe, publishing guidance and advice on scaling up cargo bikes and cycle infrastructure, as well as sharing stories of cargo-biking ‘Local Heroes’. Helping to present cities and national governments in the heart of power is the European Cycle Logistics Federation, which recently launched a strategic partnership with Cycling Industries Europe to create a more unified, stronger advocacy platform for cycling logistics businesses in Europe.
Scope and evidence

In Germany, nearly 100,000 cargo bikes are sold every year, with its neighbour France ratcheting up around 50,000 sales a year. The UK is a little behind, totting up only 2,000 cargo bike sales for commercial use last year.
The UK is forecast to increase by 60% this year and the market size is set to inflate by 15-fold within the next five years.
By 2030, estimates suggest annual European sales of one million cargo bikes for commercial uses and a further one million sales for family cargo bikes.
The UK-based bike manufacturer, Raleigh, has only been selling cargo bikes for a few years but they have already seen their sales increase by 75% last year at their Nottingham manufacturing facility.
Sales across Europe are growing at around 50% year on year.
A recent study from Possible found that electric cargo bikes deliver 60% faster than vans in urban centres, totting up higher average speeds and dropping off ten parcels an hour, compared to a van’s six.
The Possible report found that cargo bikes cut emissions by 90% compared with diesel vans and by a third when compared with electric vans.
The cargo bike boom is, in part, being driven by shifts in consumer habits that have shifted due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, with the number of UK consumers doing a weekly grocery shop online doubling since the first lockdown.
By 2030, estimates suggest annual European sales of one million cargo bikes for commercial uses and a further one million sales for family cargo bikes.

Lessons for rapid transition

It is easy to overlook old, unglamorous technologies that can play a big, new role in rapid transition: a perfect storm of road congestion, traffic threats, air pollution and changes in how people buy things has elevated the cargo bike from a niche transport option to a mainstream delivery choice. Cargo bikes offer a win-win solution for cities, residents, safer streets, the environment and businesses alike.
Greening growing industries early is vital to meeting climate targets: With spending habits shifting during the Covid-19 pandemic, providing low-impact and low-emissions solutions for new, expanding markets is essential.
The public sector can be a market maker by enabling transitions: Government and business can work hand-in-hand at a local level to scale up low-impact climate solutions through grant schemes in order to capture the social and commercial benefits. And, mutual learning and collaboration across cities makes roll-out easier.

Friendly regulatory environment bolsters efforts by 70 companies, including Baidu, Alibaba 
By CRAIG S. SMITH 
Chinese tech giant Baidu opened a 2.5-acre test track and operations base for autonomous vehicles last week, its third such site in the country and its latest move to dominate the “robotaxi” industry.
China’s self-driving vehicle market is moving faster than that of the United States thanks to government regulatory support. In the past year, Baidu and AV competitor AutoX, backed by e-commerce giant Alibaba, have announced a series of steps in the race toward what promises to be a massive market.
Swiss bank UBS estimates that by 2030, the global robotaxi market will be worth at least $2 trillion annually, with robotaxi fleet purchases accounting for 12% of all new cars sold.
In April last year, Baidu began offering free robotaxi trips in Changsha within a pre-defined area, followed by Cangzhou and Beijing. Then, in December, AutoX launched a trial of driverless robotaxis in the southern city of Shenzhen and opened that service to the public in January this year. In May, Baidu started commercial robotaxi service within a 1.2 square-mile zone in western Beijing and last month opened a pilot program to the public covering a 60-square-mile district in the southern city of Guangzhou.
The Shanghai operations center will serve as a base for Baidu’s Apollo brand robotaxis, robobuses and other types of autonomous vehicles in the region. The base will collect data and calibrate connected vehicles and act as a remote control center.
“Our base will serve as an intelligent connectivity ecosystem and expand to over 200 operating vehicles to become the largest autonomous driving fleet in East China,” said a Baidu spokesperson.
AutoX opened a robotaxi operations center in Shanghai last year, and has been offering limited robotaxi service to the public in Shanghai for more than a year. The company’s robotaxi service in Shenzhen, meanwhile, operates without a safety driver or operator in the car. “This is still the only fully driverless RoboTaxi operation in China until today,” said Jewel Z. Li, AutoX’s chief operating officer.
This is still the only fully driverless RoboTaxi operation in China until today.
Since Beijing approved self-driving car tests on designated public roads more than three years ago, dozens of cities have awarded pilot program permits to more than 70 companies.
Chinese regulators began allowing limited robotaxi trials June 2019 and this January, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology released a draft policy permitting AV testing on highways with a goal of opening the robotaxi market by 2025.
Baidu has announced plans to deploy 3,000 robotaxis in 30 Chinese cities by the end of 2023. AutoX and WeRide, which is backed by the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, have similarly ambitious goals.
Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-hailing company that has recently faced Chinese regulatory troubles, also operates a fleet of autonomous vehicles.
China is pursuing other self-driving vehicle applications, including autonomous heavy trucks. Baidu is working on a robotic excavator system with the University of Maryland, integrating perception, planning, and control capabilities to enable material loading with no human intervention. The excavation system has been deployed in real-world scenarios, operating continuously for over 24 hours at a time.

 While Back to the Future’s vision of a world with hoverboards and flying cars has yet to come true, transport is changing, and Intelligent Transport Systems are the driving force behind these developments. A new research partnership between the University of the Sunshine Coast (USC) and the Queensland Government will help prepare the state for futuristic transport that uses emerging technologies to better connect people and goods in more sustainable, efficient and convenient ways. 
By Patricia Mae Tagabe

USC Senior Lecturer in Environmental Engineering, Dr Helen Fairweather, said the three-year Transport Academic Partnership, including the Department of Transport and Main Roads’ funding support, was not only exciting for the university’s students and academics, but would also have a profound impact on the wider community and environment.
“Transport is changing rapidly, and we need more research that targets the interface between civil infrastructure and the Internet of Things (IoT),” Dr Fairweather said.
“The key questions are: How do we move people and goods without relying on systems for fuel-emitting cars, and how can technology help us achieve that?
“It’s not just about electric cars and light rail. It’s about how telecommunications and advanced analytics can change how our transport network operates and how more sustainable service can be provided.”
Dr Fairweather said that the specific research projects will be jointly developed with the Department of Transport and Main Roads once a foundation USC Chair of Sustainable Transport Engineering has been appointed at its Moreton Bay campus.
However, initial areas of focus would include the use of big data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart transport.
The Moreton Bay campus will become a field site for testing cutting-edge transport innovations, such as:
♦ New IoT sensor technologies for Intelligent Transport Systems
♦ Advanced video imagery for providing information about vehicle movements and assessing areas of traffic congestion
♦ Access to vehicle-based data to analyse driver and passenger behaviour
♦ Advanced AI to understand differences amongst distinct road user groups in typical traffic situations Dr Fairweather said that Intelligent Transport Systems have delivered important but incremental changes to Australia’s transport systems, and the momentum to advance Australia’s transport technology industries is only growing.
“We are already seeing major changes in terms of the way traffic moves in the cities, e.g. using sensors, CCTV footage and AI to better control traffic lights and variable speed signs to improve traffic flow.
This is providing a 20-30 per cent uplift in capacity for the same infrastructure, supporting more sustainable outcomes,” Dr Fairweather said.
“Electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles will be the single biggest transformation over the coming decade as the technology is proven now, and scale and affordability will come as the volume of sales increase.
“Full situational awareness of the transport network will become more customer focused, enabling customers to make more informed choices around whether to travel, what mode of transport to use, when to travel and what on-trip changes are necessary to optimise their journey.
“There are some innovations in terms of maintenance using video captured by vehicles and AI to improve the response to road maintenance needs.
Flooding alerts in regional areas are becoming more sophisticated which is critical for road users, particularly in preventing motorists from entering flooded roads.”
Predictions for future transport technology innovations
According to Dr Fairweather, futuristic transport technologies are not far on the horizon as we start to see vehicles with connected and autonomous technologies emerging over the next couple of decades.
“Connectivity of vehicles to roadside infrastructure and the ability for vehicles to exchange information and data (talk to each other) is already emerging in Europe, USA and Asia.
These technologies will be critical in improving safety and will be important in the roadmap to full automation,” Dr Fairweather said.
“Depending on how this is rolled out between industry suppliers, government regulators and road authorities, this is likely to blur the current distinction between private vehicle ownership and public transport.
“The Mobility as a Service (MAAS) model, where people subscribe to a suite of transport options and pay a monthly fee as opposed to having to own anything, could therefore become a viable service offering.
This subscription package would include access to everything – public transport, e-transport (e.g.. electric scooters), cars, buses, trains etc.
“I do see a time when we will be able to use personal mobility options for first and last mile transport between major bus and rail networks, though active transport (e.g. cycling and walking) provides a better option in terms of public health outcomes.”
Dr Fairweather said one potential technology of the future could consist of multi-purpose on-demand freight/passenger options with ‘capsules’ linked to a trackless tram-type system.
Each business might be able to call for a ‘freight capsule’ to go past their door, or use drones to transport lighter freight to the nearest capsule.
Perhaps the capsule can be configured quickly to change from a transport to a freight option to optimise its use. “Overall, autonomous public transport options will be cheaper to run and will become more accessible to regional communities, lessening their reliance on private vehicles, while big data analytics and AI will provide for more optimum traffic networks in the future,” Dr Fairweather said.
“In terms of sustainability, I think there will be a greater focus on the fuels and construction materials we’re using, Building Information Modelling (BIM) to conceive, design, build and manage transport infrastructure, transition to more active transport and better understanding of the socio-economic aspects of equity when it comes to access to public transport options.”
Collaboration key to improving Australia’stransport networks
Transport and Main Roads Minister, Mark Bailey, said the Queensland Government welcomed the opportunity to work with USC and look ahead at new, innovative ideas that would enable all Australians to move more safely, efficiently, and sustainably through the nation’s transport networks.
“This partnership will enable USC to research and provide insights into the type of technologies we will use to move from A to B in the next few decades,” Mr Bailey said.
“Queensland is well placed to be at the forefront of transport innovation. I look forward to the team’s work exploring how future technology can boost our capability to deliver a single, integrated transport network accessible to everyone.”
Dr Fairweather agreed that Queensland is well placed to be at the forefront of transport innovation compared to other states because the Department of Transport and Main Roads understands the importance of partnering with academia to accelerate the development and deployment of technologies that will shape the future of transport.
“The department has positioned itself to undertake and make use of the latest cutting-edge research in the transport field through their investment in a Transport Academic Partnerships across Brisbane Partner Universities, with the intent to extend that to other regional universities,” Dr Fairweather said.
“They are very mindful that the skills required of their workforce is rapidly changing and the university partnerships will be critical to providing the courses for this upskilling.
“They also make an active investment in applied research programs so they can continue to improve, adapt and adopt new ways of doing things.”
As part of a Transport Academic Partnership, Department of Transport and Main Roads will provide advice on their research needs to ensure the research projects align with their strategic plan and the Queensland Government priorities of supporting economic activity and job creation, improving community safety and protecting the environment.
“Through this research partnership, civil infrastructure and IoT will become better integrated by developing and deploying the appropriate and fit-for-use technology and communication protocols to protect individual privacy and maximise cyber security, while providing the analytics to make a major shift in the development and operation of our transport infrastructure,” Dr Fairweather said.

The adoption of new-age technologies and systems that are more resilient to uncertainties can make a difference to automotive companies and industry as a whole.
By  Rupak Rathore 
The automobile sector has been adversely impacted by the sudden disruption caused by the pandemic and associated lockdown last year. It recorded a drop in sales across segments and manufacturing as well as supply chains broke down. However, the industry started showing early signs of recovery with an increase in month over month sales in the latter half of 2020.
While the second wave once again affected the automotive sector adversely, it has reaffirmed the need for the sector to focus on aggressive adoption of new-age technologies and create systems more resilient to uncertainties. The following are ways by which some of the 21st century’s emerging digital technologies can make a difference to automotive companies.
Robotic Process Automation (RPA):
Process automation using digital workers brings increased accuracy. Be it the regulatory compliance, interpretability of paper into the digitized medium, machine dismantling and assembling, or inventory management, RPA has come a long way to ensure near quasi perfect accuracy. These software robots are programmed with suitable algorithms to perform a particular task. Once the robots are well trained, these tasks are automated. These digital workers are getting increasingly sophisticated with a combination of Machine Learning and Image Processing algorithms.
Big Data:
Big Data in the automobile industry can help with customer retention through improved after-sales services. While the profit margins for the dealer vary with vehicle models, it is the after-sales services and periodic maintenance from which they earn a sizeable profit. The need of the hour is personalized services to forge great relationships with customers. Big Data helps to analyse the buyer’s likings and preferences for recommending a customized offering for a particular customer. Big Data can also predict probable wear and tear, after which a damaged part (of the vehicle) can cause an interruption in daily use or complete breakdown. It also alerts the driver by segmenting and analysing his driving patterns and habits that can cause an accident. Big Data can also be used for improving vehicle design, as it can give insights into how the vehicle/component performs in market conditions.
Cloud Computing:
Cloud computing can assist automotive companies by reducing the onsite IT hardware costs of an organisation, especially in terms of power consumption and hardware repair, depreciation and labour. Cloud computing can improve the efficiency of GPS and entertainment systems installed in the car. Cars can become smart and perceptive vehicles equipped to tackle varied road and traffic situations. However, such controls and continuous information feed requires perpetual and on-demand predisposition of systems that can only happen with the help of the cloud. Furthermore, data forms the core of numerous functions in the automobile industry, and it is directly proportional to the manufacturing of a vehicle model. The data from various departments need to be collaborated to produce the perfect model.
Predictive and Advanced Data Analytics:
Predictive and advanced data analytics can help in product quality management, product recall and improved customer satisfaction. Predictive analytics can help the quality management teams to process a large set of information (historical) that can reveal the underlying cause. It allows for the early detection of issues and minimises the probability of their occurrence in the future. Data can also facilitate in improving the safety of the vehicle – both during design and while being driven. Furthermore, it assures a better and more efficient recall process.
Artificial Intelligence:
AI is impacting the automobile industry in a big way. It can alert the drivers of a hazardous situation or component failure well before the scenario turns fatal. AI can also assist in the quality inspection that is a time-consuming process.
Integration of Telematics and Health:
As vehicles become more integrated with smartphones and wearables, avenues for improving emergency response – using a combination of telematics, vehicle sensors and wearables – emerge, which can save precious lives. Overall road safety can be improved by using Car2X frameworks for inter-vehicle communication.
Virtual Reality:
Virtual Reality is of great help to companies, dealers and customers alike. It helps automobile engineers to work together remotely (especially in the designing process). The design process on the physical mock-up requires massive resources and is time-consuming too. Furthermore, it reduces the need to create a prototype after every examination stage. The technology also helps the customers to get a feel of their new automobile without its physical body. Through virtual reality, they can get an immersive digital buying experience. A leading data and vehicle visualisation platform reported that as many as 76 lakh Indians chose to experience the features of their next car in 3D on the internet in 2020. VR has proven to be a boon for dealers during the prevalence of COVID-19, they have been able to continue with their business despite the logistic challenges and scarcity of resources. It is difficult for dealers to have a physical model of every specification as most of the manufacturers regularly launch restyled and remodelled versions. Customers always want to buy the most recent model. The use of VR can prove to be a better, immersive, and persuasive way to speed up their decision making. This is an ideal, win-win situation for both the customers and dealers.
Augmented Reality:
Augmented Reality provides a realistic feel for testing the critical functions and capabilities of a vehicle. The conventional method of testing requires extensive physical trials, which is expensive and cumbersome. With AR, engineers can build a prototype, have an easier time with critical logistics and technical checkpoints and can implement modifications in lesser time. Speedier production, more innovation and reduced cost would be possible with the integration of this technology.
While it is projected that the global automotive industry will grow to just under nine trillion U.S. dollars by 2030, an Invest India report suggests that the automobile industry may reach the 300 million dollar mark by 2026. However for the sector to script the kind of growth post-pandemic recovery, digital integration is a must.

In order to restore vitality to urban areas, authorities will need to focus on reducing carbon emissions.Transforming the transportation sector will be particularly important, write two experts from the International Finance Corporation.The World Bank has released steps for sustainable financing strategies, which include investment reviews and cash injections into public transit.These are stepping stones to a greener, resilient and inclusive urban recovery from COVID-19.
Rapid movement of people and goods has always defined thriving cities. But the COVID-19 pandemic slowed much of that movement, and the way forward is uncertain. One thing is clear, efforts to restore vitality to urban areas need to be tempered with a profound willingness to rebuild in a less carbon-intensive manner.As municipal leaders tackle the challenges of leading their cities out of crisis mode, the transportation sector will play a key role in a greener, resilient and inclusive recovery. Smart transportation planning can create jobs and lay the groundwork for sustainable urban growth.An IFC analysis found that cities that prioritize green transportation stand to gain from an investment opportunity of as much as $2.7 trillion. It is estimated that the green transportation sector will create some 53 million direct jobs across emerging market countries by 2030. As urbanization accelerates around the world, it is more important than ever that transit systems reduce their carbon-dependency . Well-planned urban transit is a critical component of the world-wide effort to stem climate change.
The COVID-19 crisis presented significant challenges to municipal transit operators. As ridership rates fell between 50 percent and 90 percent, mass transit operators were forced to bear substantial costs for salaries and system maintenance. There is little doubt that a strong demand for mass transit will return. Mass transit is the most affordable option for the vast majority of the world’s urban residents, and it is essential that all transit services are safe, reliable and eco-friendly. Given the essential role public transport plays in emerging market economies, governmental support for both public and private operators is crucial to sustain operations in the short term and improve service levels in the long term.
The World Bank has published steps for sustainable financing strategies, including investment reviews and cash injections. The challenge for rapidly growing cities in lower-income countries is particularly severe, as scaling public transit requires keeping prices low. Subsidies are usually required to improve services and invest in technology, and finding the resources to subsidies can be difficult.
One step which urban leaders can take now is to improve access to electric vehicles (EVs). For example, IFC supported Ukraine’s Galnaftogaz (GNG), the country’s leading retail distributor of transportation fuels, to help promote electric passenger vehicles uptake by investing in fast-charging stations. The project will enable the company to avoid annual greenhouse gas emissions of around 4,990 tons of carbon dioxide. Increasing the proportion of EVs on the road makes urban air cleaner for everyone. (Transport pollution is a major contributor to respiratory illness in cities around the world).
Municipalities can work with the private sector to invest in EV charging stations and other EV infrastructure. With appropriate zoning modifications, EV infrastructure can be built near bus and rail hubs, where it can serve mass transit and commercial delivery needs.
New bus rapid transit systems, also called BRTs, are another affordable and flexible way to improve urban transit while also stimulating the local economy. Carefully planned stations, digital ticketing and platform-level boarding make for easy and efficient loading and unloading of people and goods.
It is crucial to ensure that public transit remains a reliable and practical option for everyone, including those who use mobility devices and push strollers. BRTs typically replace old buses with new fleets that may feature intelligent transportation systems, which allows system operators to improve rider satisfaction and reduce traffic congestion. Dedicated smartphone apps allow riders to plan their journeys with precision. System operators can use this data to optimize bus schedules and operations for efficiency.
In 2021, IFC helped the city of Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine to develop and introduce a smart city platform, as well as modernize and upgrade its public transport system. IFC’s EUR35 million investment will help the municipality rehabilitate up to 2 kilometers of roads on one of the city’s center streets, purchase modern battery-electric trolleybuses and electric buses, and upgrade the electric transport infrastructure.
The project will help reduce traffic congestion and pollution in urban areas, optimize traffic management, and provide better digital services to ensure the quality and sustainability of communal services.
Although mass transit usage declined during the pandemic, increased reliance on e-commerce resulted in a massive surge of urban delivery traffic. Last-mile delivery companies scrambled to meet an increase in demand without sacrificing their own efficiency. In the process, many of these companies invested in smart tracking systems and upgraded their intelligent routing and fleet management software.
The surge in demand for clean, cost-effective last-mile delivery solutions has created an unprecedented opportunity for cities to forge alliances with the private sector. Cities can lead the way by designing clean transit solutions which work for businesses and local residents . In emerging markets, two and three-wheeled EV logistics, which are already becoming cost competitive with fossil fuel options, can be encouraged.
What’s the World Economic Forum doing about the future of cities?
Journeys may change, but the importance of rapid movement within cities will remain. Advances in data management software and intelligent traffic systems allow municipalities to control both traffic and pollution more effectively than ever before.
IFC can help plan and finance transit projects as cities plan their emergence from unprecedented crisis. We have the tools to ensure that recovery plans continue the global effort to reduce climate change.
The silver lining of the COVID-19 crisis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rethink the world’s cities. New technologies enable cities to plan and rebuild greener and smarter than ever before. Deploying transport solutions driven by smart technologies and innovative tools will be key to build healthy, thriving post-pandemic cities where people and goods move with ease.

 AI has a pivotal role to play in revolutionizing the logistics industry.
By Madhurjya Chowdhury

Everything grew increasingly digital as a result of globalization; consumers began to buy more online and expect their products or services to be delivered faster and for less money. In today’s fast-paced world, logistics and supply chains must adapt to quickly changing consumer demands. As per ML news, supply chains waste hours each day on paperwork, resulting in a yearly loss of more than $170,000. Using AI for some of the jobs is one approach to improve the issue. Transferring certain manual activities to machines can help alleviate the problem of paper-based paperwork while also increasing productivity. In this article, you will explore how AI is contributing to the logistics industry.
AI Impact on Logistics
Artificial intelligence has radically altered the logistics and supply chain industries. Here are five ways that AI-driven technology may help businesses enhance and innovate their logistics and supply chain operations.
1. Robotics
Robotics refers to the use of intelligent machines in the supply chain management process. As per Statista research, revenues of logistics service robotics would reach more than $6 billion in 2021. Robots can generally do routine operations such as delivery, transportation, storing, picking, packaging, and routing. The primary distinction between regular industrial robots and AI-assisted robots is that the latter can execute more complicated jobs without the need for human intervention. Smart robots may also evolve by learning new tasks and executing increasingly complicated behaviors. It means that this gear can partially, and in some circumstances completely, replace humans in the distribution process, making it more predictable, simple to regulate, and successful. Drones, for example, may transport a certain amount of load and can fly or move on land or water. RFID (radio-frequency identification) solutions can sort, identify, and deliver items through the warehouse autonomously. As a result, robotics in logistics can boost production while also making it easier for humans to manage the various phases of delivery.
2. Autonomous Vehicles
Autonomous vehicles have the potential to dramatically improve delivery efficiency. This technology has the potential to improve dependability, cost efficiency, and predictability. Even though we have yet to acquire completely autonomous delivery vehicles, it is just a matter of time. As technology advances, it is conceivable to anticipate that in the not-too-distant future, consumers will get their shipments without the need for human intervention. According to the Mckinsey research, autonomous vehicles, especially drones, will deliver over 80% of all packages. By overcoming transportation obstacles and inconveniences, this technology will improve the efficiency of the distribution process.
3. Computer Vision
Every vision system is made up of two major components: the camera and the “brain” computer that controls everything. Based on a sophisticated algorithm, it can detect objects, goods, particular activities, colors, and perform actions. This technology may be used to identify damage and increase productivity in the production process. Amazon, for example, employs a computer vision-based AI system to offload a trailer of merchandise in 30 minutes rather than the hours it would take without it.
Furthermore, computer vision-enabled systems can automatically detect damage, determining the cause of the damage, its severity, and taking steps to prevent future cargo mishaps. The loading and unloading of products is another application of computer vision. This technology not only recognizes and locates items and packages in the store, but it also does so autonomously. With this in mind, machine learning systems are extensively utilized to reduce customer churn, improve supply chain quality, and improve the delivery process’s security.
4. Predictive Analysis
Any logistics firm must be able to function efficiently, deliver on time, and save transportation expenses. To accomplish this, an in-depth study based on historical data is required to detect risk trends, implement corrective steps, and generate projections. You can only dramatically enhance logistics operations, modify shipment patterns, offer on delivery, and forecast consumer behavior by utilizing predictive analysis. MHI Annual Industry Survey for 2020 stated that the percentage of logistics companies using predictive analysis took a flight from 17% in 2017 to 30% in 2019. It can not only improve supply chain visibility, optimize routes, and make tracking and planning shipments easier, but it can also identify unexpected circumstances and hazards. If properly implemented, it will considerably decrease operating expenses and assist businesses in making more informed decisions.
5. Big Data
Logistics, like every other business, generate a considerable volume of data. It would have been more difficult to handle all of this material without a well-maintained data management system. Companies can save money and avoid late shipments and deliveries by collecting data from multiple sources such as drivers’ applications, devices, and systems, and assessing how various elements impact the delivery process. You may obtain insight into historical delivery statistics, driver ratings, and make changes using big data analytics. More than 91% of Fortune 1000 firms, according to the study, are investing in big data. Furthermore, AI-driven data analytics enables businesses to account for variables such as fleet maintenance schedules, vehicle sensors, inclement weather, and fuel costs. It not only provides drivers with destination ideas and helps them travel more effectively, but it also allows businesses to reduce logistical expenses on a route-by-route basis.
Conclusion
By bringing new methods of dealing with data and improvements across the whole supply chain, AI is changing logistics procedures. Predictive analysis, robots, computer vision, deep learning, and autonomous vehicles are examples of technology that can greatly improve logistics and supply chain performance. They have the ability to alter the way items are managed in warehouses, as well as optimize last-mile delivery and logistics networks. With this in mind, logistics and supply chain firms could consider these technologies as a means of enhancing efficiency and lowering costs.

Charging infrastructure can take up to 2 years to install
By Brian Straight  
Supply  chain issues may be pushing back deliveries of electric vehicles, but  that doesn’t mean last-mile delivery fleets looking to adopt can sit  back and wait.
“Fleets may think they have plenty of time … but 
sometimes it will take one to two years for the infrastructure upgrades 
from the utility,” explained Greg Hintler, U.S. managing director for The Mobility House,
 an EV charging infrastructure company. “If you want to have electric 
vehicles in two years, you should have already started or need to be 
getting started now.”
Hintler said he has heard from several 
companies that were promised EV delivery vans this year, but suppliers 
are pushing back those delivery timelines as much as two years.
“What
 we’ve heard from fleets, what we’ve heard from OEMs is there are 
massive supply chain challenges and what that translates to is very few 
vehicles being delivered at the moment,” he said. “A lot of fleets are 
hearing deliveries are being pushed to the end of the year, and the 
reality is it will be 2023.”
The Mobility House focuses on 
building out charging infrastructure. Among its clients are the Austrian
 Postal Service and the Irish Postal Service. Hintler said its customer 
base now crosses 800 fleets in the U.S. and Europe.
“Because we 
are playing both in the United States and Europe, we can … get a preview
 of what’s to come,” he said while speaking to Modern Shipper from 
Germany. “Here in Europe, they are so far ahead compared to what we are 
seeing in the U.S. However, we have commitments now from the major 
players. We know it is going to come in the U.S. and come quickly. There
 is a ton of demand. Demand isn’t the issue, it’s on the supply chain.”
Delays
 are being caused by many of the same issues affecting traditional 
automotive lines — semiconductors — as well as port congestion. In 
addition, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has strained steel supplies 
globally, with about one-third of European steel coming from plants in 
Ukraine.
“On top of that, the enormous uptake in demand, whether 
it is because of government regulation or corporate [goals] … has become
 a global challenge and all the suppliers are trying to allocate the 
little product they can get pretty evenly,” he said.
Power needs are not a major concern
One
 of the big questions around the deployment of electric vehicles is the 
strain they could place on the existing electric grid. Hintler said 
companies like The Mobility House are working with all stakeholders to 
ensure power needs are met.
“There have been many studies that 
show the generation — the amount of electricity needed — is not the 
issue, it’s the demand,” he said. “What’s important is that the 
infrastructure is built intelligently … to dampen that effect from 
electric vehicles on the grid.”
Hintler pointed to smart charging systems and managing charging time as potential solutions.
“How
 can we charge during times when there is a lot of renewable [energy] 
generation and how can we reduce the charging at times when there are 
extra stresses on the grid?” he asked. “If you control [the generation],
 those electric vehicles will be part of the solution and part of the 
future of the electric grid.”
The last-mile race
There
 are a number of vehicle makers looking to gain leverage in the 
last-mile delivery space. GM-backed BrightDrop, Amazon-funded Rivian, 
Ford and a host of other smaller firms are all battling for pieces of 
the global electric delivery van market.
With expected growth of 17% annually
 until 2030, the EV market is poised for a massive breakthrough in the 
years to come. Hintler said last-mile delivery firms are waiting, but 
some challenges remain.
“Pretty much everyone knows that electric 
is going to be the future, and most players, especially in the last-mile
 delivery and the fleet space, know that whoever figures out how to 
deploy electric vehicles at scale first will have a massive competitive 
advantage,” he said. “So there is a true race on the ground that 

 what is taking place in the media.
“What is not being 
discussed but we hear about is the challenges,” Hintler added, pointing 
to the complexity of current systems and the complexity of working with 
utilities among them. “The industry is still nascent and learning a 
lot.”
Among the complexities is the fact that not only is one 
industry being disrupted, but EVs are trying to disrupt two global 
industries at once.
“This is going to be the biggest teamwork and 
team task challenge of our generation,” Hintler said. “This is a massive
 transition, not within one industry but two industries. We not only are
 transitioning the automotive industry, we are transitioning the 
electric industry.”
OEMs challenged
Rivian
 has faced recent skepticism on its ability to ultimately deliver on the
 100,000 EV order from Amazon. The company has faced a series of 
problems, including the ability to get semiconductors. According to a 
recent Forbes article, the company cut its 2022 production target in half to 25,000 vehicles and expects an operating loss.
BrightDrop,
 which has orders for tens of thousands of its electric vans from 
companies such as FedEx, Verizon and Walmart, may be better situated to 
thrive as semiconductors become available thanks to GM’s backing. The 
same goes for Ford, although Hintler said he asked a customer about an 
expected delivery of hundreds of Ford E-Transit vans and the customer 
had only received three so far.
“They were hearing the end of the year,” he said.
The big advice Hintler wanted to impart on fleets looking to adopt was to seek out technologies that are neutral.
“In  a nascent market where you don’t know which players are going to be  around for long or which companies are going to succeed, you want to be  sure you use interoperability solutions, both on the hardware side and  the [technology] side,” he said, noting that more suppliers are  delivering common component options. “There is definitely a drive toward  interoperability as a whole, but still some players are propagating  proprietary systems.”

The e-hailing industry is expected to develop at a CAGR between 15 to 28 per cent, resulting in an increased market size of $285bn by 2030
By NICHOLAS WATSONMAY
If there’s one thing everyone agrees on in the aftermath of the pandemic, it’s that mobility as we know it has irrevocably changed. The transportation industry had already been disrupted by technology before 2020, with ride-hailing apps allowing commuters to have more control over their movements.
However, the pandemic transformed that experience into one of necessity and convenience. Add in the fact that, close to 20 per cent of the global workforce was told to work from home for the foreseeable future in the early months of the pandemic – the overall impact on the transportation sector cannot be understated.
According to a report published by Arthur D. Little in 2020, the lockdown reduced overall mobility demand in the US by up to 90 per cent, with 40-70 per cent reductions persisting during the recovery period. As people attempt to preserve social distance during journeys, this has been accompanied by increased personal mobility (cycling, walking, vehicles).
Before the pandemic, urban mobility demand was expected to expand exponentially, with urbanisation continuing and global demand for passenger mobility in urbanised regions expected to double by 2050 compared to 2010. Research indicates the pandemic had little effect on this growth tendency since the city population continued to expand faster than the overall growth of the global population.
That’s where mobility on demand (MoD) and mobility as a service comes into the spotlight. MoD is a new way of travelling that combines several easily accessible means of transportation to make an individual’s journeys more efficient. MoD is entirely based on technology, enabling people to be better informed of available options and make them more productive with their time.
Private firms, public entities, startups, and mobile apps such as ride-hailing apps and car-share providers, which cut out the middlemen and use independent contractors, provide solutions that facilitate MoD today. MoD dispels the myth that the only efficient way to travel anywhere – whether locally or internationally – is to own a vehicle or pay large sums to rent. The ownership trend is quickly giving way to usership or partnership. With a growing number of environmentally concerned young people entering the workforce and a high reliance on digital assets, MoD provides them the satisfaction of reducing their carbon footprint.
The sharing economy is all about fractionalisation and digitalisation of assets or services. Every sector is undergoinga digital transformation and re-thinking business and revenue models to engage with more customers regularly. With cars, particularly in the context of car sharing, an ‘illiquid asset’, that is, one that is ordinarily only available to one person is fractionalised through digitalisation into a car that is measured and priced by minute or meter and may be driven by anyone with a license.
Additionally, with ride-hailing industries, the expense or requirement of a license is removed because the customer receives the added benefit of a driver for the customer, allowing for even more micro-mobility access. According to another report by Arthur D. Little, the e-hailing industry is expected to develop at a CAGR between 15 to 28 per cent, resulting in an increased market size of $285bn by 2030. Primary drivers of this growth will be the lower rate of car ownership among millennials and the expected progressive integration of ride-hailing into other solutions, which include car sharing and bike sharing.
In a McKinsey survey of the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and China, it was discovered that key factors related to health and hygiene changed how private and business trips were now chosen. The cost of a trip was no longer as important as staying safe from health hazards. While the world shifts from CAPEX to OPEX and from ownership to usership, the ‘Netflix’ generation in the GCC is more interested in consumption than long-term acquisition. As automobiles become fully autonomous, car sharing, and ride-hailing will merge. Car sharing providers are already developing products to prepare for this, giving them more opportunities to scale horizontally and vertically while also providing an already experienced customer with more options. This will significantly influence the GCC, where young people who want to live aspirational lives are already establishing themselves.
Before the sharing economy, people were unable to engage due to the lack of infrastructure, and the high cost of current modes of transportation. A trip from Deira to Expo 2020 used to cost a minimum of Dhs120, but now only costs Dhs40, thanks to car sharing. And yet, there is still a long way to go.
In the UAE, the car-sharing to passenger car market has a penetration rate of 0.05 per cent. This is a twelve-fold decrease from Tallinn’s (in Estonia) 0.64 per cent and Moscow’s 0.87 per cent. Nonetheless, the UAE is seen as a more digitally savvy populace with higher internet penetration than most countries. The UAE has approximately 1,000 car-sharing cars today, while Moscow has 36,000. According to research conducted by car-sharing companies, the short-term potential is roughly 8,000 vehicles, with a long-term prospect of over 30,000 vehicles over the next five years.
The potential of the mobility market is enormous. The key to growth is an ecosystem approach and technology enablement. Only a business model based on partnerships and scalability can achieve sustainable development. People were previously unable to make trips that could not be completed by walking or cycling due to a lack of a practical mobility alternative. According to European statistics, one car-sharing vehicle replaces 17 cars that would otherwise take up parking spots, waste fuel, and emit carbon.
Finally, technology can help stream-line an experience, changing the dynamics of the business model and revenue/cost streams in the process. The question to consider for newcomers to the market is whether they can generate a million dollars from a million customers or ten customers? Which route is the best option if they can do this with ease and with an excellent interface? One option has a lower risk of losing a customer, but the other has a higher revenue loss. The challenge then is to build a service or platform that can appeal to customers across the market while providing five-star services for everyone.

 The shared e-scooter could become as common on city streets as a bus, or even cars, according to those in the industry. 
By Skip Descant 
The shared e-scooter could become as common on city streets as a bus, or even cars, according to those in the industry.
“What
 was new, and kind of different over the last five years or so, scooters
 have become much more mainstream,” said Ashwini Chhabra, chief public 
policy officer at TIER Mobility, the world’s largest shared 
micromobility operator. The company recently acquired Spin. 
“They’ve  become more like how cities approached bike-share. And I think that  transition will continue to where I think these services will be  embraced much in the way that the city bus is considered to be as  American as the library and the post office,” Chhabra added, speaking on  a panel discussion last month at the CoMotion MIAMI conference. “It may  have started out as a private service, but it provides a public service  for a lot of our riders.” 
As anyone who follows urban mobility 
will tell you, e-scooters arrived on the scene about five years ago. 
They have weathered the rapid head-turning — and often criticism — from 
everyone from city officials to residents, who have both embraced and 
balked at these new mobility gadgets. Since then, regulations have been 
put in place, data sharing has been established, and most importantly, 
partnerships have taken root among scooter operators and other mobility 
providers like ride-hailing and transit. 
It is this evolution 
that most excites industry watchers like Chhabra, who pointed to the 
merging of micromobility with transit in a number of European cities as 
the kind of trend we could — and should — see in the U.S. 
“And 
so, there is this realization at some point, that you are actually 
growing the size of the pie by facilitating these introductions,” said 
Chhabra. 
To
 form those partnerships means “getting the digital right,” said 
Chhabra. But also, thinking through issues like the locations of 
mobility hubs, the placement of transit stops and the development of 
micromobility infrastructure like protected bike lanes. 
“The  places where we’ve seen the most successful programs are those where  MaaS [mobility as a service] and multimodality doesn’t exist  independently, but is part of a broader initiative to repurpose streets,  repurpose parking, away from car utilization alone,” said Chhabra. 
Merging  micromobility and transit can help regions meet some of the larger  transportation goals, particularly when thinking about sustainability or  equity, said Carlos Cruz-Casas, chief innovation officer of the  Miami-Dade County Department of Transportation and Public Works, adding  that incentivizing bikes and e-bikes could help riders travel farther  than they would on a scooter, and help to bring about other health  outcomes. 
“The more modes the better,” said Cruz-Casas, in some of his comments on the panel. 
He also noted transit agencies are taking on more modes under their operations 
“Bike-share
 started out as a private service. It’s quasi-public in many places now.
 And I can see a day when it’s much more akin to a bus service, because 
cities realize, this is actually a necessary service people are looking 
to us to provide,” he added. 
Other cities like Denver have taken a
 slightly different approach to encourage the use of micromobility. The 
city and county government recently launched a program to provide cash 
rebates for residents buying an e-bike or e-cargo bike. After only three
 weeks the city limited the program when it reached capacity. 
“The
 program has reached the maximum number of rebates that funding with 
allow,” Winna MacLaren, manager of communications and engagement in the 
Office of Climate Action, Sustainability and Resiliency in the city and 
county of Denver told Government Technology. The office will monitor how
 many of the vouchers are redeemed, and will “resume the program once we
 know how much funding remains after the initial rebate redemption 
period ends. 
“We
 do not anticipate all of the rebates that were issued in the first 
three weeks of the program will be redeemed. We also do have funding for
 a full second and third year of the program,” MacLaren added. 
The  vouchers provided $400 for an e-bike, or $900 toward the purchase of an  electric cargo bike. The rebates were higher for residents qualifying  as low income. Consequently, some 40 percent of the applicants were  “income-qualified,” said MacLaren.

The  car-sharing venture formed by BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz AG will be owned  by Stellantis. The move comes along as the automakers struggle to make  the business profitable. All the automakers involved in the deal did not  disclose any price details. Currently, the business has around 3.4  million customers across 16 European cities.
With this move, Stellantis aims to have new streams of revenue as it shifts to electric vehicles. Also, for BMW
 and Mercedes, this move is another step in reshaping mobility 
offerings. Back in 2018, the automakers combined and started the 
services to compete with providers like Uber to save costs. Now, the 
challenges to making the services profitable without the requisite scale
 continue. So they decided to sell the business, according to Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, Stellantis has increased its presence effectively since 
its formation. It has been working on getting younger buyers to try its 
brand and keeping up with changing mobility needs. The share Now 
service, currently available in European countries, was added to 
long-term rental options. Various models like Minis and Mercedes-Benz A-Class were made available for rentals through apps. However, there have been struggles to make it profitable.
Estimates
While the companies didn’t disclose the price, Juergen Pieper, an 
analyst at Bankhaus Metzler, said it would likely be below 500 million 
euros ($525 million), and perhaps around 250 million euros. Pieper 
estimates Share Now has lost around 200 million euros annually, the 
analyst said via email. “Maybe Stellantis with its low financial 
investment and a leaner cost structure can make more out of it,” Pieper 
said. Volkswagen AG, Stellantis’ biggest European rival, is closing in 
on the acquisition of Europcar as part of a broader push to create a 
sprawling mobility services platform. A consortium led by the German 
industrial giant expects the deal to be completed before the end of the 
second quarter.
Free2Move has around 2 million customers for its app-based parking,  leasing, and rental services. Share Now provides so-called free-floating  car-sharing services in 16 European cities and has around 3.4 million  customers.  Over the next decade, Stellantis intends to expand  Free2move’s presence worldwide, growing it to 15 million active users  and achieving net revenues of 2.8 billion euros. The acquisition comes a  little over a year after the mega-merger between Fiat Chrysler and PSA  Group to form a sprawling manufacturer across 14 brands with nameplates  like Jeep, Ram, and Fiat to add scale to the shift toward electric  vehicles and autonomous driving.

By Shubhankar GautamTime loss due to traffic jams, rising levels of environmental pollution, an increasing number of fatalities, some of the many woes of urban commuting. Enter smart mobility, a solution based on the use of different modes of transportation instead of one’s personal vehicle. This concept, which runs on the use of carpooling, ridesharing, and bike commuting, has taken cities by storm. Not only that, this market is expected to grow further still though things have been going a little downhill since the advent of the pandemic.
Impact of COVID-19 on the Smart Mobility Market: An Analysis
2020 has been a grim year for all industrial sectors, especially the smart mobility market. The primary reason for the downfall of the smart mobility market can be attributed to a decline in demand for carpooling and ridesharing services across the world, owing to safety concerns.
While it is true that the market is expected to experience even slower growth during 2021, industry experts expect to see the curve rising from the year 2022 onwards. This forecast is based on the belief that adequate safety measures will be introduced for carpooling and ridesharing, such as the placement of plastic barriers between the car’s driver and its passengers.
Factors Affecting the Growth of Smart Mobility
The application of electricity to transportation and the use of carpooling are not novel concepts. In fact, the first Electric Vehicle (EV) was introduced in the US as early as 1889, and by the early 1900s, nearly one-third of the vehicles on the American streets were electricity-powered. It was not until the 1930s that cheap Texas oil made EVs a thing of the past. However, here we stand at the cusp of another golden age wherein EVs and smart mobility are bound to become an essential part of the future.
Having said that, it is natural for one to ask about the significant factors influencing the smart mobility market. The factors may either be drivers or barriers that need to be dealt with the innovation and a common purpose to turn the idea of smart mobility into a living reality.
#1 The Way People Viewed Vehicles are Changing
It was only a few decades back that owning a private car was every family’s dream. Mass production of automobiles and budget-friendly fuel prices brought this ideal within the reach of the average citizen, and as a result, vehicle-centric urban design and personal, door-to-door transportation became the norm.
Today, the scenario is much different. The present millennial-led era prefers not to own a car; instead, this young generation of commuters is shifting in favor of ridesharing services such as Uber or Lyft – they prefer to subscribe to a car-sharing service rather than bear the cost of a personal car, which includes fuel and maintenance costs. Is it any surprise that such new vehicle usage patterns will encourage the growth of the smart mobility market?
#2 Technology is Advancing at a Lightning-Fast Pace
From autonomous vehicles that are smart enough to run on their own to smart parking systems that make the tedious task of parking a piece of cake, technology is the key driver of the smart mobility market. The hyper-connectivity offered by the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G will make it easier for cities to manage traffic, cut down environmental pollution, and make better use of infrastructure. Commuters can have real-time information for smoother and safer transit.
Then, with the use of self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles and drone deliveries, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) predicts that the world may see a whopping 90% reduction in traffic deaths, a 40% reduction in travel time, and a 500% increase in lane capacity. Does it get any smarter than this!
#3 Low Rate of Internet Penetration in Developing Regions
Here’s a barrier to entry for smart mobility systems in full force. Now, the use of ridesharing services requires the involvement of three parties, namely the rider, the driver, and the service provider. The entire process of matching riders with drivers, fare estimation and ride payment are to be carried out via smartphone apps, which in turn require good internet connectivity. 
Unfortunately, some regions, such as Burundi, Chad, and Somalia, among others, have extremely low internet penetration that hinders the development of smart mobility systems in such countries. Once the proper infrastructure for connectivity has been established, the dream of smart mobility can proceed onwards.
#4 An Entirely New Infrastructure and Value Chain is Needed
As much as IoT requires proper infrastructure for connectivity, so does the use of Electric Vehicles require ubiquitous charging infrastructure. The current scenario is pretty awkward wherein potential EV drivers do not see an infrastructure that allows them to buy an EV and drive with confidence, and on the other hand, potential infrastructure providers do not see mass demand insight. Until the time charging stations become as common as gas stations are today, this one barrier-to-entry will make the adoption of EVs a far-fetched dream.
#5 Another Major Driver is Government Policies
Central, state, and city governments can join hands to speed up the adoption of smart mobility systems. Although several US state governments have already directed their focus towards measures such as tax credits and rebates to make smart mobility more affordable for early adopters and are also imposing strict vehicle emission standards for automobile manufacturers, the need of the hour is to offer exclusive EV parking in congested areas, and establishment of ZEZs or Zero Emission Zones wherein traffic will be restricted to bikes, pedestrians, delivery vehicles, and electric vehicles – measures already in place by the city governments of London, Brussels, Paris, and Madrid. Such government policies are sure to accelerate the growth of the smart mobility market.
Top Companies Expected to Dominate the Smart Mobility Market
To create technologically evolved smart mobility solutions, companies need to come up with products that are developed from a long-term market perspective as opposed to short-term creations. This is because as the smart mobility market is set in stone and matures, consumers will naturally demand integrated solutions – a mix of travel services with ancillary services.
As of now, the following companies are expected to take the lead in the future smart mobility market –
CiscoMaaS Global OySiemensTomTom InternationalInnoviz Technologies Inc.Toyota Motor CorporationFord Motor Company, among others.
Despite its present sluggish growth, smart mobility will be a factor in customer preference, changing the way people travel. It’s only a matter of time before this service model comes to the mainstream, and come it will, reaching its projected growth of $70.46 billion by the year 2027.

Ever since the SF Park smart parking system of San Francisco was introduced in 2011, constant improvements have been made and milestones achieved. For instance, the SF Park system automatically adjusts the parking meter rates based on the traffic flow. Since the system was implemented to distribute parking evenly, the hourly rates rise or fall to fill up or empty parking spaces, keeping in mind the traffic conditions on the streets. But, how bad was the traffic issue for San Francisco’s motorists that the city needed such a radical change and how has such change progressed? Let us find out how San Francisco reduced traffic with Smart Parking.
San Francisco: Top Contestant for Traffic Congestions
Though San Francisco did not score the worst in terms of traffic congestion, the city was notorious as one of the top contestants for traffic issues. And the leading cause for such woes was cruising – motorists circling the streets in search of a vacant parking spot. Some drivers spent an excessive amount of time cruising behind the wheel. All their hope rested on chance – the area where they’re headed and whether or not it is the rush hour.
For instance – Areas such as the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge were choke points and as such, remained overcrowded for most part of the day. However, the worse congestion time was the morning hours, precisely around 8:00 AM. On average, Thursdays scored worse than any other day of the week.
Moreover, the gridlock, mainly during peak hours, branched from the root of the issue – finding an available parking spot. The busy downtown and Chinatown were inconveniently crowded to the extent that drivers were compelled to opt for metered or garage parking as finding a street parking spot was like spotting a unicorn. So, how San Francisco reduced traffic with Smart Parking?
Smart Parking: Making Life Easier for Drivers
Now, finding a vacant parking spot in San Francisco may be a real adventure, but that’s not the kind of adventure most of us like to embark on. With the emergence, trial-and-error efforts, and official usage of smart parking technology, the city’s drivers are experiencing a much-needed respite from their daily traffic struggles.
By displaying available parking spots via smart applications and guiding a driver to the exact location of the desired spot, the smart parking system – SF Park – has not only dealt with the city’s motorists’ worst nightmare but has also streamlined the traffic flow. Vehicle miles have definitely decreased as drivers can spot an available parking spot with ease. Also, local sales tax revenue has increased, indicating that people spent lesser time cruising around and more on their businesses.
Having said that, it is also true that the exact impact of the city’s SF Park system cannot be quantified as of now. This does not mean bad news. It merely means that there is room for improvement – the system’s efficiency and performance is as realistic as it can get. By and by, as advancements in smart parking technology take place (and they are taking place), the system will naturally become smarter and more efficient.
Does the Future Look Even Brighter?
As of now, the one area that especially needs improvement is the availability of a guaranteed parking space every single time. So, what can drivers do until the issue is dealt with? The best approach would be to reserve a monthly parking SF. These credentials allow drivers to enter and exit the facility freely without worrying about the availability of a parking space. This feature is especially useful for those working downtown or visiting downtown on a regular basis.
Moving on to the future; San Francisco’s SF Park is bound to get better as constant improvements are being made to IoT or the Internet of Things – the technology behind Smart Parking. Once the problem of guaranteed availability has been solved, motorists will already know the total number of available parking spots even before they enter the lot. This will be displayed via smart apps. At that ideal time, neither will there be any traffic congestions, nor loss of fuel and money and no unwanted carbon emissions into the environment.
Place the word “smart” in front of any noun, and you can instantly have something that somehow sounds improved. However, smart parking’s current achievements do not cancel the fact that there is a learning curve and a long way to go before the vision of a cruise-free San Francisco can be realized. However, when that happens, all worries and fears with regards to missing commitments or arriving late for a corporate meeting will become a distant memory.

Implement a driver coaching systemThe data gathered from telematics systems illustrates certain modifications that could improve driver behavior. Implementing these modifications will result in a reduction of losses and increased safety on the roads.
A driver coaching program is both a written and verbal safety policy that clearly states driver expectations and performance. Encourage consistent communication with employees and establish a system for employees to provide feedback, address concerns or get their questions answered in a swift and easy manner.
Master the system you’re usingThe best way to get the most out of your telematics system is to take the time to learn it.
You may uncover beneficial use-cases for your particular industry that you may not have without knowing the full capabilities. Lean on your telematics provider’s training resources.
They should have an extensive learning/help center and provide role-based training sessions and courses so that your drivers and admins only need to learn what matters to their day-to-day use of the platform.
These courses can be offered live online or recorded for on-demand use. Take the time to learn your telematics program and about the various metrics you can measure and leverage.
Clearly define and communicate the key metrics that you want to trackPay attention to details but avoid obsessing over each tiny data point.
Telematics can provide fleet managers with a great deal of data, so it’s imperative to have goals and an overall operational plan. This could include benchmarks in driver productivity and efficiency, safety, fleet maintenance and any other business-related goals.
By spotlighting data that makes sense for your relevant objectives, it will allow you to adjust and make decisions that move the needle in a meaningful way for your set criteria.
Further to this point, be intentional with your internal communication plan and be transparent in sharing with employees which key performance indicators will be measured when they are hired. Have managers and team leads set clear expectations upfront regarding productivity and safety.
Fleet managers can garner driver buy-in for safety coaching programs and performance feedback reviews by consistently communicating with employees and establishing an efficient and easy system for employees to provide feedback, address concerns and have questions answered.
Another communication approach would be to start small and only focus on the most impactful metrics at first. Initially tracking only important data points— such as idling rates, delivery times and basic driving behaviors — can prevent drivers from feeling overwhelmed and heavily monitored when adopting a new telematics system, and fleet managers can always expand upon the initial list of tracked metrics as time goes on.
DON’T
Rely on telematics as the only way to evaluate employees and identify bad driversYes, it is important to carefully analyze the collected data, but do not use this as the sole form of driver evaluation. This could lead to distrust between managers and employees.
There may have been extenuating circumstances, such as traffic delays or road accidents, that caused a reduction in driver efficiency, so make sure to review the entire situation before labeling someone as a bad driver.
As discussed in the “dos,” a holistic approach to employee evaluation is rooted in open communication. By having conversations with customers, coworkers and – most importantly – the driver in question, you will gain a more accurate representation of an employee’s performance.
Be hard on employees when adopting your telematics softwareIt is natural for employees to be resistant or feel overwhelmed when a company implements new technologies.
Do not expect employees to embrace the system immediately. Give them time to feel it out, which will in time improve their overall performance. You also do not want to hide any information from employees. Instead, implement a user-friendly system and capitalize on transparency with employees. Hiding important information or eluding arduous questions will not lead to desired driver results.
Wait for the end of month/week reporting to take corrective actionsTraditional driver safety coaching programs are based on reports that are captured and produced on a weekly/monthly basis.
This useful information can be used in a reactive manner, but newer systems can offer feedback in real-time that is customized to your requirements. By setting up custom alerts in your telematics system, you can be notified in real-time when issues arise and take action before the problem persists long enough to be increasingly harmful to your bottom line.
Telematics has a lot to offer fleet managers and following best practices will help get the most out of the systems.
From driver coaching and safety programs to productivity tracking to business benchmarks, telematics can provide insights into almost every area of fleet management. Smart data management and application will help fleet managers maximize the functionality of their systems.
By following the dos and avoiding the don’ts, telematics will drive fleet managers to success.

The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) has seen a significant spike in transit ridership in recent months, and even more so in recent weeks as gas prices continue to ride. 
“MTS was budgeting for an 11 percent increase in ridership over last fiscal year. Our new estimates show ridership will jump 45 percent over the previous year,” said Sharon Cooney, MTS CEO. “We still have room to grow to get back to pre-pandemic levels, but these are great indicators. This sustained growth coupled with recent ridership spikes prove that people are motivated to save money, and still know that transit is a safe and affordable way to get around.” 
MTS has developed a dedicated webpage with a commute calculator for those interested in learning about the cost of driving alone vs. taking transit. The calculator factors in information such as commuting miles, estimated miles per gallon, parking costs, number of days commuting and price per gallon of fuel. The agency has also launched digital advertisements to educate commuters about the costs of driving vs. taking transit.  
Preliminary ridership estimates from last week show: 
Ridership was up to nearly 200,000 trips per weekday (197,000) for the week of March 7-11, which is approximately 70 percent of the pre-COVID-19 baseline.  This is the highest ridership has been since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trolley ridership has grown to more than 80 percent of pre-pandemic level. On Wednesday, March 9, ridership jumped 102 percent systemwide vs. the same day in 2021 There was a 111 percent ridership increase on trolleys. There was a 94 percent ridership increase on buses. 
Additionally, year-over-year comparison by month shows that ridership has consistently been significantly higher compared to last year. Even during the height of the Omicron surge in January, MTS transit ridership showed consistent improvement over 2021. In February, MTS hit its highest monthly increase in ridership over the same month last year. 
Another positive development for transit is that the UC San Diego Blue Line is performing well since the 11-mile extension to UTC opened in November 2021. The Blue Line is now averaging nearly 60,000 trips per weekday since the start of February. This is approximately a 33 percent ridership increase since the extension opened on Nov. 21.

It’s estimated that about 50 percent of car trips in urban areas are three miles or less in length, making them a possible candidate for replacement with other modes. 
By Skip Descant
It stands to reason that moving more car trips in urban areas to micromobility modes will reduce congestion. New research quantifies this reduction, offering another tool for policymakers and infrastructure planners.
A study from Carnegie Mellon University zeroes in on how micromobility — namely e-bikes — can affect congestion in Seattle, finding that if even 10 percent of short car trips during peak afternoon travel were replaced with micromobility, more than 4,800 car trips would not happen, decreasing vehicle miles traveled by more than 7,300 miles a day, a 2.76 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
“The big takeaways are that micromobility could decrease congestion, especially on highly congested corridors. But you’re going to need wide-scale bike lane deployment,” said Corey Harper, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and one of the authors of the study.
It’s estimated that about 50 percent of car trips in urban areas are three miles or less in length, making them a possible candidate for replacement with other modes.
Americans are not huge cyclists. Only about 1 percent of trips in the United States are taken by biking, according to the 2017 National Household Travel Survey. But one of the many side effects of the COVID-19 pandemic was an increase in cycling in a number of metro areas. And micromobility advocates have been bullish about the growth potential for this transportation sector.
Speaking at the Micromobility World Conference last month, Travis VanderZanden, founder and CEO of Bird, said his company’s aim has always been to serve short trips.
“So far, it seems like we’ve been able to have a pretty good impact on some of these short-range trips. But there’s still a lot of work to be done,” said VanderZanden.
VanderZanden also stressed the need for more micromobility infrastructure to better serve these new forms of transportation.
“We need to continue to solve this chicken and egg problem for cities by showing them, hey, people are willing to get out of cars now. Let’s make sure the infrastructure follows suit. And that’s bike lanes. But it’s also more dedicated parking for micromobility as well,” said VanderZanden.
“Right now,” said Harper, “if you replaced a lot of short car trips with bikes, then these bike trips are going to interfere with private vehicles, because there’s not a lot of bike lanes.”
In Seattle, it’s estimated that 18 percent of short car trips could be replaced with micromobility, and during peak travel times, some 70 percent of trips in the Puget Sound region are made by private vehicles, according to the study.
The research could be used by metropolitan planning agencies, cycling advocates, transportation planners and others, said Harper.
“This quantifies the impacts more bike lanes could have in terms of energy use and getting more people out of cars and onto bikes,” he added.
It will take more than pedal power to solve the world’s climate crisis, say researchers, who note replacing a lot of short urban trips with micromobility would likely do more to improve congestion than to reduce energy usage. The reason is simple: Longer trips, made by cars and other vehicles, still account for the bulk of emissions associated with the transportation sector.
“So we’re going to do a whole lot more than just replace short trips with micromobility. We’re going to have to electrify vehicles, buses, trucks. We have to target longer trips with commuter trains, commuter buses, in order for cities to meet those climate change targets that the White House set out,” said Harper. “We’re going to have to do a lot more than just say, ‘Alright, everybody get on a bike.'”

The connected e-bike sharing solution adopted by the cities of Copenaghen, Rotterdam and  Stockholm, along with some of the major cities of the UK, exhibits in Paris the latest  solutions for urban mobility.  

VAIMOO, the Made in Italy connected e-bike sharing designed by Angel Company, which  develops high-tecnological solutions for railways, digital mechatronics and aerospace, returns  to Autonomy Paris, the major international exhibit dedicated to sustainable mobility which  takes place in Paris on March 16-17, 2022.  
During these two days, VAIMOO (Booth F-11) is going to present its e-bike sharing solutions  both docked (station-based) and hybrid (virtual stations). The solutions consist of electric  bikes and a management software with the latest updates in order to efficiently respond to  the growing necessities of urban mobility.  
Autonomy Paris is also going to be an opportunity to dialogue with the major players of the  industry, which will discuss about the current evolutions along with present and future  mobility trends.  
On March 16, VAIMOO will be one of the on-stage protagonists of the panel “e-Bike Sharing:  a resource for Public Transports” during which European transport operators such as  Deutsche Bahn and Jelbi will share their experiences with e-bike sharing services integrated  with public transport, in order to find common guidelines and best practice to face this  challenge.  On March 17, Matteo Pertosa – CEO & Founder of VAIMOO – will close the second and last  day with the speech ‘e-Bikes: a solution for Urban Transport & Logistics’ in occasion of which  will share his vision about the spreading of e-bikes, talking about how delivery companies and  sharing platforms can benefit from this evolution, keeping an eye on the future.

 Mobility as a Service (MaaS) remains a trending term for media  platforms and app developers to use. However, David Hensher, Chinh Ho  and John Nelson suggest the term should be used more appropriately to  describe a fully integrated and sustainable system, rather than just an  enhanced travel planning app.                                                                                                              
Almost without exception, many media platforms post a growing amount of news items under the heading of Mobility as a Service or MaaS.  LinkedIn, for example, is replete with such material (including webinars) promoted in the name of MaaS. But how much of this news is really about MaaS? We had previously tried to clarify what MaaS is and  what MaaS is not with a benchmark definition, but it still seems as if the app developers (or more accurately the travel planner folks) and  many transport operators, continue to promote their new tools as MaaS. 
A  most recent one (there are too many to mention) is Scottish MaaS trial goes live (launched on 21 June). It is not MaaS. It is a multi-modal journey planner. The promo video  states that it is “travel made simple” and a ‘travel companion’. While  this is a nice idea and potentially represents a step-forward in terms  of meeting traveller needs with an integrated ticketing and payment  function, overly promoting such an app as MaaS suggests that many MaaS  promoters on social media don’t get, or refuse to get, what constitutes  MaaS and the four levels of MaaS integration.
To clarify what MaaS is, and is not, ITLS researchers, together with 
MaaS pioneers and advocators, have put forward a benchmark definition as
 follows[1]:
‘MaaS is a framework for delivering a portfolio of multi-modal 
mobility services that places the user at the centre of the offer. MaaS 
frameworks are ideally designed to achieve sustainable policy goals and 
objectives. MaaS is an integrated transport service brokered by an 
integrator through a digital platform. A digital platform provides 
information, booking, ticketing, payment (as PAYG and/or subscription 
plans), and feedback that improves the travel experience. The MaaS 
framework can operate at any spatial scale(i.e., urban or 
regional or global) and cover any combination of multi-modal and 
non-transport-related multi-service offerings, including the private car
 and parking, whether subsidised or not by the public sector. MaaS is 
not simply a digital version of a travel planner, nor a flexible 
transport service (such as Mobility on Demand), nor a single shared 
transport offering (such as car sharing). ‘Emerging MaaS’ best describes
 MaaS offered on a niche foundation. This relates to situations where 
MaaS is offered on a limited spatial scale, to a limited segment of 
society or focused on limited modes of transport. The MaaS framework 
becomes mainstream when the usage by travellers dominates a spatial 
scale and the framework encompasses a majority of the modes of 
transport. All the other variants that do not meet our definition might 
be referred to as ‘Aspiring MaaS’ given the normal usage of ‘aspiring’ 
having ‘hope’ or ‘ambitions’. (Hensher et al. 2021)
Let us try and simplify this position in a way that may be more 
persuasive in ensuring that MaaS is properly ascribed to, since if we 
continue to promote any mobility idea as MaaS, particularly the growth 
industry of travel planning apps, then the real fear is that we enter 
into a downward spiral of time wasted on debate and effort that amounts 
to nothing more than confusion, frustration and lack of progress on what
 can really make a difference to delivering sustainable (and 
commercially attractive) solutions and improved traveller satisfaction.
Critically, MaaS needs to show value in both sustainability and profitability  to have buy-in from both government/society and business. Without these  two critical value propositions, and buy-in from critical stakeholders  in the MaaS eco-system, MaaS will likely develop as a niche service, and  techno/app developers can (and will) lead the debates which may not  deliver real long term value for society. How exactly we achieve buy-in  from both business and government is yet unknown, but the evidence we  have amassed so far suggests that it is difficult and requires a lot of  collaboration and trust between stakeholders, which is far from assured. 
 Unless MaaS brokers/aggregators can negotiate with transportation  network companies (TNCs), and government, to use a cross-subsidy  strategy to fund MaaS services that deliver both socially acceptable  sustainability and commercial goals, MaaS is unlikely to ever be  profitable or societally sustainable. In most markets in general, any  unprofitable products and services would likely receive no significant  investment from businesses to obtain scalability unless there is a high  level of confidence in turning the corner in the (foreseeable) future.  MaaS is no different. Without the possibility of scalability, MaaS  becomes ‘another’ initiative in the government’s list of initiatives to  prioritise. The path to scalability currently seems to suffer from a  dominant focus on the next enhanced digital platform and very little  else.
So what is the value proposition likely to be that we should support?  If it is agreed that MaaS is unlikely to be commercial and thus is only  of value if it delivers on sustainability goals, then it is doubtful it  will go beyond what we can achieve already through the existing ways of  delivering transport.
 This is the big question. How can MaaS really  make a difference? It may be that an App developer offering better and  timely information remains relevant and convenient for some, but we ask  the promoters to stop calling this MaaS since it only improves travel  information, although this improvement is still valuable (and the  addition of other contextual / points of interest information is also  useful). But does it change travel behaviour enough to claim an impact  on sustainable goals? Collective evidence, we have to date, suggests  that a MaaS app will not change travel behaviour to deliver  sustainability outcomes, but a fully integrated MaaS system can in time  (Ho et al. 2021). Without the need to show complicated modelling  evidence, this early finding is easy to comprehend.
It remains a challenge to get key players in the intelligent mobility  space to recognise that offering a mixture of modes with the exact same levels of services such as travel times, reliability, and frequency  (which are the real drivers of traveller behavior) already offered outside of a MaaS eco-system, with PAYG financial discounts associated with some journey planning Apps, can hardly be claimed as added-value for travellers. This is why we would prefer if the great majority of App developers and transport suppliers and their advisers start talking about ‘Enhanced Travel Information Service’ or ETIS and not MaaS!

Living with the pressure of delivering reliable, on-demand transportation to riders in a 700-square-mile service area with just two vehicles may seem like a tall order, but for the past year it’s simply been business as usual for the operations team at Battle Creek Transit.
In March of 2021, Battle Creek Transit received funding through a Michigan Department of Transportation grant to launch the Calhoun County Coordinated Mobility Pilot – or as it came to be known to residents in the community: BCGo.
Today, BCGo provides door-to-door microtransit service across all of Calhoun County, including in the cities of Battle Creek, Marshall and Albion. As they approach the service’s one-year anniversary, it’s fair to say that not only has BCGo demonstrated the feasibility of an on-demand microtransit service in the county, but it’s also made an important impact on the community members that regularly use the service.
‘The demand far exceeded anyone’s expectations’
Residents of Calhoun County who don’t own or have regular access to a vehicle have faced a rough road in the past couple of years when it comes to finding reliable mobility options that meet their daily needs. Straightforward tasks such as commuting to a job interview, meeting up with friends or simply trying to get to the grocery store suddenly become much more stressful when faced with limited transportation options.
“We have always known that there was demand for this kind of service, especially in the rural areas of the county, but BCGo has allowed us to prove that the demand far exceeded what anyone’s expectations were and has provided us the opportunity to engage with the community like never before,” said Mallory Avis, public transit director, city of Battle Creek.
In March of 2020, one year prior to BCGo’s launch, a Calhoun County Transit Survey uncovered that these types of challenges were an everyday reality for many citizens of Calhoun County. The study painted a picture of a community in critical need of alternative mobility options. It found that Calhoun County was home to more senior citizens and people living with disabilities than the national average. At the same time, a higher-than-average percentage of the county’s population was living under 150 percent of the poverty line and a lower-than-average percentage of households had regular access to more than one car.
To make matters worse, in September of 2019 a reliable private cab company that had operated for decades in Battle Creek, the largest city in the county, had to close its doors for good.
All told, the Calhoun County Transit Survey estimated that the county faced an annual shortfall of more than 20,000 available trips relative to demand. One year later, the BCGo service hit the road for the first time to help residents of Calhoun County safely and reliably navigate through their community.
Building the platform
To help power the new microtransit service, the team at Battle Creek Transit turned to shared mobility provider Liftango to build the Demand-Responsive Transit platform that would allow users to book trips straight from their phones using the BCGo App (iOS and Android.)
This technology platform dynamically routes BCGo’s two vehicles throughout the service area based on real-time passenger demand so that they can maximize ridership and minimize wasted miles. Passengers that want to book their trip in advance get a truly guaranteed, pre-booked ride thanks to Liftango’s advanced matching algorithm.
“The experts will tell you that a county-wide microtransit service supported by a small fleet of vehicles will fail. The combination of Battle Creek Transit’s understanding of their community and Liftango’s unique matching approach has enabled a service that is efficient and hugely valued by the community. BCGo stands out as a true illustration of the power of demand responsive transport; something counties across the U.S. could look to replicate,” said Liftango Vice President Americas Jacob Greig.
BCGo customers can book rides up to 14 days in advance and as close to 30 minutes prior to the desired departure time. To deliver guaranteed, pre-booked rides, the BCGo app provides riders with different matching options that account for other requests already placed in the system, vehicle availability, the user’s schedule and a host of other variables. This allows commuters to access truly on-demand transport around their schedule without worrying that the ride they were depending on may not be matched in the system.
Riders without access to a smartphone or mobile device can call Battle Creek Transit Dispatch where the operations center enters their desired pick-up and drop-off times and uses the same booking system to find them the best available ride.
Measuring the impact
Since the launch of the BCGo pilot on March 8, 2021, the response and demand in the community has been overwhelming. In fact, the service’s only limitation appears to be that they simply do not have enough vehicles or staff members to keep up with the county’s demand for their service.
In the second month of operation, the service’s two vehicles were already completing dozens of trips every day. From its launch in March of 2021 through the end of the year, the service booked nearly 7,000 trips and averaged a daily ridership of close to 30 passengers.
Retention rates have also been remarkably high for the entire duration of the pilot phase. For example, from June of 2021, BCGo’s third full month of operation, through the end of December, reporting data shows that an average of 68 percent of riders each month were returning users. Many riders have come to depend on BCGo as a primary mode of transportation and this level of loyalty can be attributed in part to the fact that the service is reliable, punctual and affordable. The service is early or on time with 82 percent of pickups and 85 percent of drop-offs and ride fares are calculated dynamically based on trip mileage.
The service is also accessible to riders with special mobility assistance needs, including passengers in wheelchairs, those with portable oxygen tanks or other medical devices. The BCGo mobile application allows mobility-assisted riders to alert their driver ahead of time and automatically accounts for space requirements when completing passenger bookings. BCGo vehicles completed, on average, more than 25 mobility-assisted trips each month from March of 2021 through the end of December.
‘Expanding access to education, employment, healthcare and social activities’
Regular BCGo riders have been enthusiastic about sharing their support of the program and the impact it’s had on their lives. Community members regularly use BCGo to see friends and family members that they had been separated from for months, or even years, due to lack of reliable transportation options.
Here is what two users had to say about their experience with the BCGo service:
“I want to tell you how impressed I am with BCGo, I give your service five stars. All your drivers and dispatchers are so friendly and personable. I’m thrilled with this new service. Keep up the good work.”
“Used this service for my mother for the first time today. I have nothing but positive things to say. Prompt service plus very nice and polite employees. Affordable service. This service helped get my mom out and about after a year and a half. So thankful.”
BCGo has proved to be a successful example of how technology can completely change the way public transportation operates. The Coordinated Mobility Pilot has allowed Battle Creek Transit to demonstrate the feasibility of on-demand transportation in rural and suburban areas with a lower population density than most other service zones.
“BCGo has allowed us to better meet the needs of Calhoun County, expanding access to education, employment, healthcare, and social activities. Getting to know our customers and their stories plays a key role in the success of our pilot and the transportation services we aim to provide in the future,” said Battle Creek Transit Mobility Manager Kristy Grestini.
BCGo has changed the perception of and increased the adoption of public transportation for Calhoun County. The combination of vehicle design, technology and customer service has elevated the expectations of public transit and has allowed Battle Creek Transit and other area providers to use this energy and the data collected to advance conversations regarding transit funding and service expansions.

New Zealand’s micromobility sector
 is about blow up, with revenue expected to grow from $9.5 million in 
2020 to $2.4 billion by 2030. Paired with growth in EV adoption, a 
general desire to reduce carbon emissions, and navigating a post-Covid 
world, micromobility is increasingly looking like the future of 
transport.

 ‘Micromobility’ refers to small, lightweight vehicles that typically 
operate below the 25-30kmh mark, either as rentals or privately owned. 
Think Lime scooters or Onzo bikes, as well as the various e-bikes and 
e-scooters you can buy off the shelf.
  They are often used as ‘first mile/lastmile’ solutions in tandem with  public transport (for example to or from the home or office from the  train or bus station) or even a private car (to and from a car park).Current Time 0:00/Duration 0:30 WARWICK SMITH/STUFFPalmerston  North welcomes the arrival of e-scooters with mayor Grant Smith test  riding scooters of each of the three companies represented.
 Stuff spoke to Katherine Sandford, CEO of UBCO,
 about the micromobility industry in New Zealand, who said that 
micromobility has been largely driven by electric transportation, in 
particular the rise of the e-scooter.
 According to PS Market Research,
 the e-scooter has taken off due to the “additional comfort they offer 
over pedal-assisted bikes.” They also allow people to move faster and 
more conveniently, trading e-bikes and cars for public transport and 
e-scooters.
 Additionally, micromobility is a low-cost option, which appeals to a lot of New Zealanders.

 “With micromobility, users need not take the hassle of buying a vehicle
 and bearing vehicle maintenance, insurance, charging/refuelling, 
parking, and other expenses. The option of a low-cost commute thus 
motivates consumers to replace their walking phase with a suitable 
two-wheeler for first- and last-mile connectivity.”
 Sandford added that micromobility could also increase patronage in public transport by up to nine per cent by 2030, citing an NZTA study from 2021.

 “Cars and particularly electric cars will continue to be a valuable 
part of the total transport system, especially while public transport 
options are limited. What you use depends on the situation – whether 
you’re carrying a load of stuff, going between meetings or taking the 
kids to school. So we’ll need to make sure there are a range of 
sustainable options, as well as a high consideration of convenience.

 “People generally want to do the right thing, but if it requires too 
much effort or change in routine, then they’re far less likely to adopt a
 new approach.”

 Rising numbers startups in the sector show the current demand and 
potential for growth, mainly aiming to satisfy ‘last-mile’ connectivity.
 These include Lime, Neuron Mobility, Onzo and Beam Mobility.
  These are generally ‘dockless’ systems, which don’t require recharging  at a dedicated station when not in use, and can be both bikes and  scooters. They can be left anywhere and are usually unlocked via a  mobile application. While convenient, it means that dockless bikes  easily clutter up the streets, or even be dumped in a harbour… 
  If you’re considering investing or even starting your own micromobility  company, Sandford recommends being “obsessed” with solving your end-user’s problem.

 “New Zealanders have a real knack for getting to the heart of tricky 
problems by understanding what makes people tick and ticked off. Fail 
fast – test, rework and test again until you find users who will 
consistently pay for your product – then you know you have product 
market-fit and are ready to scale.”
 Dockless systems are generally preferred because they are cheaper to deploy, operate, and maintain.
 Ubco is operating in both private and commercial fields,
 selling bikes direct to customers online as well as trialling a 
business model where it supplies a vehicle, manages all servicing and 
maintenance, and ensures up-time to an agreed service level, in return 
for a monthly fee.
  “Ultimately this type of model will be rolled out to consumers, but in  the meantime, we’re making it easy for them to order online, unpack and  configure the product at home, and then simply register the vehicle for  on-road usage through VTNZ.”

This is the era of drones, and these unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, increasingly are becoming an integral part of everyday life.
As drones evolve, industries and governments alike are finding new ways to make use of this emerging technology. TechNewsWorld spoke with several experts to find out how drones are being put into service, and what’s on the horizon for their future use.
One theme in all of their perspectives is that ultimately, drones aren’t simply flying machines; they’re also data gatherers and processors.
“At the end of the day, our drone industry’s product is data, not aircraft,” Reese Mozer, co-founder and CEO of American Robotics, explained to TechNewsWorld. “With true automation comes the ability to collect a new category of data not previously possible, and as a result a new category of valuable analytics and insights.”
Drones range in size from that of a large aircraft to those that fit in the palm of your hand. The services they can perform are of equal variety.
“Drones are aerial robots,” Richard Schwartz, president and CEO of Pensa Systems, told TechNewsWorld. “They are lightweight, agile, a hundred times cheaper than bulky ground-based robots, and able to ‘hop over’ — no pun intended — obstacles and changes in physical locations.
“Because of this, they have the potential to be a scalable industry and multisector solution, using autonomous perception — that is, where the computer is seeing and translates what it sees into actionable impact — to further automate tasks that are either tedious or difficult for people.”
Building Drones
One innovation in the drone world has been the development of new methods of building drones themselves, including in-home workshops or other small workstations in Aquiline Drones’ Agile Manufacturing Pod (AMP) model.
“AMP is a portable, high-tech workstation that can be installed in homes, businesses, battlefields, and other settings to address the growing demand for drone services in the country,” Barry Alexander, founder and CEO of Aquiline Drones, explained to TechNewsWorld.
“It is essentially a proprietary modular manufacturing process that transforms any 12-foot by 12-foot area into a mini manufactory center in less than one day.”
This mobile manufacturing system is changing not just the way drones are made, but the way people work, as well.
“All AMP operators receive detailed instructions and guidance through the AD Cloud, an AI system that streamlines inventory, quality control and shipping,” said Alexander. “Operators can then produce as many drones as they desire, knowing that it takes approximately eight hours to produce one drone.
“Once constructed, Aquiline Drones will then purchase AMP-produced drones directly from the operator, paying between $200 to $800 above the cost of production, depending on the particular drone model.”
Emergency Response
A variety of industries and businesses are finding ways to use the unique powers of drones, especially given their capacities to gather and process data. One of the major benefits of drones in a variety of business situations is that they are, simply, safer than using people.
“On the safety front, drones reduce the requirement to utilize helicopters and human beings from climbing on vertical structures to conduct inspections,” Dave Culler, senior vice president of strategic partnerships for PrecisionHawk, told TechNewsWorld.
“Also, once a critical issue is identified from a drone, the repair is very focused, minimizing the time requirement of someone being on the structure. The quality will only improve, and AI models will ensure the critical issues are discovered in minimal time.
“Drones are very environmentally-friendly, especially compared to a helicopter flying and carrying thousands of pounds of jet fuel,” explained Culler.
Because of their unique capabilities, drones have become a vital part of the work of first responders, providing information about disasters, crimes, and other events before any person is on the scene.
“Drones provide effective disaster and medical response, including the delivery of emergency supplies and equipment to victims in areas that are not safe to travel to by others,” said Alexander.
“They can be deployed ahead of police to provide first-person viewpoints of crimes in action, including live footage of the scene and images of criminals. In a ‘smart city’ initiative, AI-driven sensors designed to pick up abnormal sounds associated with crimes and danger can be positioned in key locations across a region to give police advance warnings thus, keeping them safer on the job.
“When seconds count in an emergency event, drones can be organized ahead of first responders, fire departments and EMTs to access the situation, provide a critical analysis of the scene, and deliver lifesaving supplies to victims that are not readily accessible by a human person in time.”

Deliveries, too, are being transformed by drone technology — a trend that’s likely to increase.
“Drones can perfectly complement other means of transportation, especially in rural or hard-to-reach areas,” Thomas Dreiling, a spokesperson for Wingcopter, explained to TechNewsWorld.
“In many cases, they can deliver goods on-demand, much faster, more efficiently and, in the case of electrically-powered drones such as the Wingcopter, more environmentally-friendly than trucks, vans, or helicopters.”
Autonomously Into the Future
Drone technology is evolving quickly. As they become more sophisticated, drones are expected to become a more prominent part of everyday life in the not-so-distant future.
“Drones will play an ever-growing role in our lives, be it for deliveries, for mapping/surveying or inspection purposes, or for precision agriculture,” explained Dreiling.
“Use cases with a clearly positive societal impact such as drone-based medical delivery networks that improve access to healthcare in rural, underserved communities will increase the public’s acceptance and lead the way for other applications.”
As they become more autonomous, drones will become more integrated into all facets of human life and activities.
“We’re only a few years off from having most drones flying autonomously, long distances and inspecting, delivering pizzas and providing medical supplies in minimal time,” predicted Culler.
“The U.S. military today can fly and monitor drones across the globe. The same will be true for commercial drone applications. Inspections can and will happen from distance locations.
“Drones will also autonomously integrate with other robotic capabilities, ensuring air and ground capture complete the full end-to-end inspection solution. Automation, machine learning, and AI will advance the quality of inspections and data, ensuring insight to action is at the speed of light.”

In smart city projects,
 IoT is a key enabler, and a number of other technologies and 
applications must be used to make smart city projects a reality. Smart 
cities are becoming increasingly popular. However, there is much more to
 smart cities development than just putting together a website and 
hoping it will take off. The ability to respond in an instant is an 
important factor that has led to a shift in city formation. To develop 
smart city technology, cities must have access to information on 
sustainability, resilience, and artificial intelligence to successfully 
analyze data and improve city life.
Besides, sustainable smart 
cities also help improve infrastructure. These systems can monitor air 
quality and waste management, which is already proven in the examples of
 such cities as Singapore, Zurich, and Oslo.To
 develop smart city technology, cities must have access to information 
on sustainability, resilience, and artificial intelligence to 
successfully analyze data and improve city life.Click To Tweet
What is a Smart City?
A smart city is a technologically advanced urban area.
 Generally, it is a digitalized version of a physical city. It is one of
 the newest forms of technology as it uses different kinds of electronic
 methods to collect data. It integrates all the different layers of a 
city’s infrastructure.
This includes sensors to detect people 
walking by the street, sensors to detect when it is dark outside our 
other sensors that might be necessary for effective technological 
performance around the city. For example, a light-detecting sensor 
enables a city to turn on the streetlights automatically when necessary.
 This technology is used by governments to make decisions regarding 
transportation and climate.
The concept of a smart city involves 
bringing together a number of fields of knowledge. It includes public 
administration and e-government. The latest developments in this field 
have made it possible for cities to create and deploy their own 
intelligent systems. Developing a sustainable smart city is an important
 part of a city’s development, so the concept of a sustainable smart 
city must be embraced.
IoT Solutions Role in Smart Cities Development
Internet
 of Things (IoT) solutions have played a key role in the development of 
sustainable smart cities. They help in reducing power consumption and 
costs, as well as play a significant role in preventing crime. They can 
be deployed in public places to provide real-time monitoring, analytics,
 and decision-making tools. This can also be used to track and predict 
crime scenes.
The IoT network allows cities to track and improve 
the safety of public transportation. The use of IoT sensors in public 
transport systems can provide a wealth of data about the journey of a 
passenger. With this information, smart public transportation operators 
can improve the traveling experience.
There are many advantages of
 using IoT in a smart infrastructure. For example, it can provide 
enhanced security and convenience. It can also be used to improve 
efficiency in data collection and management. The IoT in a city is the 
way to increase the quality of the urban lifestyle.
How do IoT Technologies Build Smart Cities?
IoT
 smart city solutions can be widely used in city infrastructure. For 
instance, smart fire sensors can alert citizens of fire and coordinate 
rescue robots, which will significantly improve the safety of city 
residents. Other IoT applications are also eco-friendly and 
power-efficient.
They can also monitor speed limits and other 
factors that affect the quality of life. And because IoT solutions use 
advanced sensors, they can also help develop sustainable commerce 
models. This makes it easier for cities to build smarter infrastructure 
and services.
Best Smart Cities Using IoT Devices
Currently,
 there are more and more sustainable smart cities emerging in the world.
 They focus on the optimization of air quality monitoring, renewable 
energy, green energy systems, optimization of traffic flow, waste 
management companies, and other sustainable smart solutions in urban 
areas. Cities can realize a lot of innovative infrastructure ideas using
 IoT, that is why IoT technologies are of great importance.
Singapore
In
 recent years, Singapore has sought to become one of the world’s first 
official sustainable smart cities to harness the power of the Internet 
of Things. With one of the oldest populations in Asia, Singapore is 
addressing senior living conditions in order to reduce the risk of 
accidents.
Increasing the number of autonomous cars on the road 
has reduced accidents and loneliness among senior citizens. The 
government has also installed surveillance cameras and widened sidewalks
 in certain areas. With these innovations, the government is taking the 
lead in making Singapore a smart city.
Singapore has many aspects 
that help make it a smarter place. Its people are more connected than 
ever, and the government is using digital technologies to promote a 
smart life. Using digital technology to improve public safety is a key 
element of this approach. A smart city enables citizens to access 
information from anywhere. Such highly advanced communication 
technologies facilitate the city’s digital infrastructure development 
and put Singapore in one line with the best IoT smart cities.
Singapore
 has a rapidly growing technology ecosystem. The land transport 
authority has recently expanded its autonomous vehicle pilot zones and 
is working to integrate active mobility with public transportation. By 
integrating a smart city with the existing transport system, people can 
live in an environment that is able to handle any situation that may 
arise. City officials want to make the city a “citizen-centric” one.
Additionally,
 Singapore’s government is highly concerned with the environmental 
situation and has already taken a lot of initiatives that push Singapore
 to the list of the world’s smartest cities. For example, Singapore has 
implemented a smart waste bin system. It is aimed at improving air 
quality and fitting the United Nations regulations on environmental 
policy.
What is more, Singapore has big plans for the future 
integration of smart city technologies. Some of the more innovative 
services are already in place. For example, the Singapore Police Force 
has a web-based electronic police center that helps citizens file police
 reports. The system also allows citizens to access information and 
other information they might need online.
Another initiative is 
the Singapore Power mobile app. It allows citizens to see their monthly 
bills and submit meter readings, and it also helps them audit their 
homes’ usage. With the help of IoT, Singapore can become a global 
leader, and with this understanding, the government allocates a lot of 
resources on realizing smart city projects.
Zurich
Zurich,
 being listed as the second smartest city is attempting to become the 
best in the world with a number of initiatives. The innovations team is 
working with the municipal government, SBB, and various electrical 
utilities in the Canton of Zurich. They are collaborating with a wide 
range of companies to make it easier for citizens to participate. With a
 lean approach, they are able to make the entire process transparent, 
which makes it a lot easier to implement.
Zurich takes a lot of 
initiatives focused on decreasing power consumption and optimizing 
digital security. Other initiatives include reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions, circular waste management, and implementing technology-based 
plans to keep the city safe and crime-free. All of these initiatives are
 possible due to the effective use of smart sensors.
Zurich 
supports innovative, responsible, and sustainable development. It seeks 
to improve public transport, increase energy efficiency, and reduce 
pollution. It also offers climate-neutral mobility. Zurich’s initiative 
is aimed at increasing the quality of life in the city.
Additionally,
 Zurich is pursuing innovative projects to overcome its challenges. The 
concept of smart cities is already a big challenge. Not only is it 
difficult to implement but it also requires a thorough understanding of 
people and society. This is why Zurich becomes a role model in the 
concept of Swiss smart cities.
Zurich has invested in fiber-optic 
networks and top-level infrastructure. In addition to this, Zurich’s 
smart streetlights can be a great example to other cities around the 
world. Such a creation of connected devices and networks will make 
Zurich more an attractive place to live in.
Sure thing, Zurich is 
not a pioneer in the smart city movement but it shows a really 
impressive development lastly. Its initiatives include the creation of 
“smart communities” that are part of larger metropolitan areas. Zurich’s
 smart communities will be able to provide the services that people 
need.
It will also allow the city to expand its public mobility in
 a resource-saving way. Zurich is planning to develop a mobility 
platform to serve its citizens and to help them navigate the city. With 
smart communities, Zurich will have safer streets and an easier way for a
 city to manage direct traffic.
Zurich’s transportation, energy, 
and water suppliers are working together to create a sustainable city. 
The city’s municipal government has taken a lead in this movement, with 
the integration of smart traffic lights, smart metering, smart grids, 
and other related projects. They are working with innovative companies 
to develop integrated solutions that not only increase efficiency and 
reduce costs but also promote a better quality of life for residents.

The
 Norwegian capital stands among the best smart cities in the world. It 
realizes a lot of smart city solutions, including solutions for urban 
traffic congestion, smart parking projects, lowering energy usage, and 
other urban planning initiatives. For example, the E-Street project in 
Oslo, Norway, is aimed at making the city’s streets more efficient and 
reducing energy consumption.
Some of these projects focus on 
building new, energy-efficient buildings, retrofitting existing 
buildings, and testing electric buses (school buses, public buses, 
etc.). In fact, the project helps the city to save over 70 percent of 
energy. The project will also introduce new technologies like solar 
panels and will include energy-efficient lamps and smart lighting.
The
 innovative technology that is being used in Oslo’s city plans is not 
limited to energy savings. The connected sensors in these streetlights 
also monitor the humidity and rain levels, enabling the city to optimize
 its waste collection operations. The city’s streets will be connected 
to digital bus stops, which will let citizens know when their bus will 
arrive. The system will also include a parking guide for smart cars.
Another
 initiative, called the Climate Dashboard, aims to help the city make an
 environmentally friendly effort. The climate dashboard will allow 
citizens to follow up on environmental initiatives’ progress. With the 
help of the Climate Dashboard, the city is taking the necessary steps to
 ensure its eco-friendly future.
Another initiative focuses on 
sustainable transportation. The region has a lot of public-private 
collaborations, and Oslo has several such partnerships. The city has a 
lot of potential for improvement. Its innovative programs include smart 
parking, automated streetlights, and bicycle rental points. Furthermore,
 it is planning to introduce a “Smart Oslo Pitch” competition that will 
encourage entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas and help improve the 
quality of life for its citizens.
The city is already working on a
 number of initiatives to make the city more inclusive. The city has 
already implemented six projects and has even made a map of its 
neighborhood. The project’s first phase focuses on making the city 
greener and more sustainable. Its six smart projects, meanwhile, aim to 
increase accessibility for residents and improve accessibility for 
businesses and the local population. These ideas will help make the city
 more accessible to all people.
What Makes Smart Cities Successful?
Organization and Planning
For
 a smart city initiative to be successful it needs to be 
well-thought-out and organized on different levels. The city of the 
future should address the issues of its residents. There are various 
issues to solve: crime, congestion, emergency fire response, waste 
management, active mobility options, police security, absence of 
essential utilities, public transportation, and low-quality housing and 
public administrations.
Given the severe rivalry for talent across
 urban areas, dissatisfied residents are probably going leave for a more
 winning environment. To succeed, city leaders should focus on the 
prosperity, sustainability, and other essential necessities of their 
inhabitants.
Community Involvement
First
 of all, identifying the community responsible for smart city 
development is a vital component of a smart city creation process. This 
will allow smart cities to secure the power of new information and 
technologies. It is important to identify the community’s attributes to 
create a smart city. What is more, it is incredibly important to study 
the social environment for effective smart systems management and 
integration.
Financial Plan
Investment
 management is another essential component of smart infrastructure 
success. The challenges are numerous, and overcoming these obstacles 
will require a systematic approach. In some cases, budget constraints 
may prevent cities from developing smart city initiatives. The city 
needs to invest in a variety of smart technologies, including AI, smart 
city applications, IoT, and smart tools as well as other smart city 
devices.
Established Regulations
In
 order to make a smart city, city officials must implement clear 
policies that improve the quality of life for their residents. To do 
this, smart cities should implement equitable policies that benefit all 
people. Small cities, particularly those in developing countries, must 
also have a public policy that protects the environment since more than 
half of them are facing problems with them.
By implementing 
innovative city services that allow effective data analysis, governments
 will be able to better serve their citizens and use collected data for 
the improvement of entire city life. By developing a sustainable 
strategy, smart cities will create new revenue streams and cut costs.
Conclusion
A
 recent report by the United Nations showed that five out of 10 people 
living in the world will sooner or later live in urban areas. Using 
these technologies, cities can improve energy consumption, energy 
distribution, and overall sustainability. Moreover, cloud-based IoT 
applications can help manage data in real-time and make quicker 
decisions. IoT can help cities automate many processes and provide 
better public safety.
A city can use IoT to monitor the  temperature of its citizens, which is crucial for a healthy and  sustainable environment. These services are the most beneficial solution  to the city environment and the residents. That is why the decision to  integrate IoT technologies into the city infrastructure is the decision  that has to be made for a better quality of life and comfort. Now it’s  time to take a step to the future of smart life.

As logistics and freight organizations become more digitized, enterprises will be able to collect increasing amounts of data surrounding their customers, supply chain, deliveries, fleet, drivers, and more. Leading logistics organizations are already harnessing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in transportation. While a lot of enterprises currently collect this data, which will only continue to increase in the future, this data is still massively underutilized. 
Route Planning with Predictive Analytics
Using the power of AI, enterprises can unlock advanced route planning that optimizes several real-world factors in a way that’s difficult or impossible for traditional route planning to do.
 AI-powered systems will enable better customer experiences, improved fleet management, and better overall business margins in the transportation sector.
Traditional route planning factors in transportation can typically only incorporate a few factors, which are still very naive rule-based factors. However, traditional ways can’t just be replaced overnight. The entire procedure of adapting to a new technology requires time and skills to be acquired.
To enable efficient route planning with AI, enterprises need to account for a wide variety of factors. Factors include the type that is to be delivered, customer preferences, traffic patterns, local road regulations, and changing routing behaviors in addition to subjective factors such as local knowledge of delivery personnel and other preferences.With predictive analytics, an AI-powered system can optimize real-world factors for route planning that results in a lower cost of deliveries, faster delivery times, reduced shipping costs, and better asset utilization. Predictive analytics use data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data. 
Benefits of Utilizing AI For Logistics and Transportation
In the future, AI-based systems will help unlock the true potential power of enterprise data. This will enable better customer experiences, improved fleet management, faster deliveries, lower safety incidents, and better overall business margins. AI enables a win-win scenario for all stakeholders in the logistics transportation ecosystem but requires some effort and investment to build and maintain. 
Recommendations For AI
As important as AI is, an underrated component of AI is data and data engineering. Data engineering is the aspect of data science that focuses on practical applications of data collection and analysis. Before jumping onto the AI hype train, ask yourself, are you collecting critical data about your business operations? Is the data effectively stored, organized, and easily accessible? 
At the end of the day, while AI is currently a trending tech buzzword, it’s only useful to solve an actual business problem. Assess what problems you want AI-based systems to solve, adopt them into your business goals, and use the proper metrics to measure efficiencies.

Creating eco-friendly last-mile delivery strategies is an important business and societal challenge. Here are some options supply chain leaders can explore.
By George Lawton
The recent UN climate report sounded an urgent alarm on global warming. With that, an important source of carbon emissions may receive more scrutiny — the last mile.
The transportation sector is one of the main causes of global carbon emission, and last-mile deliveries are solidly in that category. Greening the last mile is a critical endeavor for today’s supply chain leaders. Most importantly, creating concrete sustainability goals that include a more eco-friendly last mile is an important step in the fight against climate change. But companies with business models that prioritize sustainability can also win with customers. More sustainable last-mile delivery models can also potentially add to the bottom line through greater efficiencies and enhance a company’s brand image.
“Enough customers care about the climate now, so it begins to become a potent aspect of a brand’s identity,” said Peter Dering, CEO at Peak Designs, a camera bag company headquartered in San Francisco that has an environmental focus as its core mission, and co-founder of Climate Neutral.
Here are 10 potential ways companies can opt for more sustainable delivery methods and support a more eco-friendly last mile.
Measure your last-mile carbon footprint
Taking an inventory of your current carbon footprint can help you understand what sustainability goals your company should focus on.
Peak inventoried its footprint and found that sourcing virgin aluminum was its biggest contributor to carbon emissions. However, sourcing recycled aluminum is challenging, particularly for a small companies that use a fraction of what large companies do. So, its leaders decided to invest in stockpiling recycled aluminum far above their requirements. Although stockpiling creates costs to manage, it is cheaper than the corresponding carbon offsets, or the investments that help cancel out carbon emission generation, such as planting trees.
Focus on sustainability metrics
Discovering the pragmatic steps you can take to reduce your carbon footprint is a key aspect of a sustainability initiative. Aspects to focus on include sustainability metrics and carbon offsets, and that may require working with an organization that specializes in these areas.
Climate Neutral, a nonprofit green trade consortium, is one such organization. Its mission is for companies to become carbon-neutral as quickly as possible.Enough customers care about the climate now, so it begins to become a potent aspect of a brand’s identity.Peter DeringCEO, Peak Designs
Climate Neutral offers a carbon emission calculator to identify impact. Companies get certified by Climate Neutral through a process that involves measuring footprint and offsetting emissions.
Companies can work toward addressing past and present emissions through carbon removal efforts and avoidance credits, said Austin Whitman, CEO of Climate Neutral. This helps highlight the return on investment of aggressive investments in reduced air shipping, clean electric vehicles for ground transport and other sustainability efforts, he said.
Connect offsets to delivery
Investing in carbon offsets — such as planting trees or using solar or wind energy — can be an important move to making the last mile more eco-friendly.
Ware2Go, a UPS warehouse fulfillment company based in Atlanta, is investigating this route.
It has recently partnered with Pachama, a San Francisco-based startup that builds a technology-verified marketplace for forest carbon offsets. Pachama monitors reforestation projects using satellite imaging and AI to ensure those projects’ ability to offset emissions.
Ware2Go is working with Pachama in efforts to fund reforestation, protect old-growth forests and improve forest management, according to the company.
“All of our merchants are automatically enrolled at no cost to them, so every business that is fulfilling with Ware2Go is participating in the program,” said Patrick Cadic, chief revenue officer at Ware2Go at the time of writing.
This investment will also help Ware2Go justify investment in other sustainable delivery options and innovative solutions, he said.
Market the green delivery option
The exponential rise of online shopping has added to traffic congestion in urban centers and to carbon dioxide emissions, to name just two issues researchers have found. Choosing a fast delivery time exacerbates these problems. Fast deliveries — in particular, next-day delivery or same-day delivery options — are particularly bad for the planet, which customers may not realize.
For example, a group of researchers at MIT found that fast shipping not only increases costs by up to 68%, it also increases total carbon emissions by up to 15%.
Communicating that information and giving consumers a slower-speed choice may help decrease harmful carbon emissions.
Researchers on the “green button project” at MIT are investigating this issue in depth. Their work suggests that companies can influence shopping habits by empowering consumers with green choices.
The researchers found that environmental explanations of slower delivery worked better than merely offering financial incentives. For example, 30% of customers who didn’t opt for slower delivery merely for economic incentives said they would be willing to wait longer for home deliveries when given environmental incentives.
The most effective way to motivate customers to wait was explaining their fast delivery choices in terms of trees.
When the MIT researchers gave consumers the choice between saving a hundred trees or opting for faster shipping, 40% said they’d wait. Researchers found that using trees to explain environmental impact has the potential for companies to cut their last mile delivery carbon footprint by 25%. They also believe it has the potential to increase customer satisfaction since the concept translates environmental issues into terms that are easy to understand and gives consumers a simple way to make a pro-environmental choice.
Use zero-emission delivery fleets
Last-mile delivery has traditionally relied on fossil fuel-powered delivery vehicles — a notorious source of carbon dioxide emissions — and supply chain leaders are beginning to look for alternatives to these.
Although delivery vehicles compose only a small portion of the traffic in urban centers, they generate more than half of overall emissions for certain contaminants, according to University of California Institute of Transportation Studies researchers. The use of zero emission and near-zero emission vehicles in the last mile is one way to help fight that. One concern about electric vehicles has been their limited range and performance compared to gas vehicles. But since 95% of parcel deliveries require ranges under 100 miles, commercially available zero-emission vehicles could easily fulfill these ranges.
Some cities are already exploring bicycle, drone and robot deliveries. Electric vehicles fall in this category as well.
Move to micro-fulfillment
Experts believe that enterprises can improve their sustainability by staging goods closer to consumers and solving some of the urban delivery issues.
Micro-fulfillment centers in the form of local smaller warehouse facilities, automated lockers, and click-and-collect points could help reduce harmful emissions and traffic congestion, according to an Accenture study on creating a sustainable last mile. A micro-fulfillment strategy in cities could reduce vehicle-related emissions by 16%-26% by 2025.
Revisit supply chain management strategies
Another complementary strategy lies in finding ways to optimize overall supply chain management methods around logistics, including better aligning the last mile with the rest of the distribution network.
One major consumer packaged goods company redesigned its supply chain to reduce the overall miles traveled by 11%, said Michael Zimmerman, partner in the strategic operations practice of global management consulting firm Kearney, headquartered in Chicago. The change produced a 10% improvement on $250 million in supply chain costs and reduced the company’s carbon footprint by 6,700 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.
Pack deliveries more efficiently
Since inefficient packing — often as a result of the push for fast deliveries — requires more vehicles to go out on the road, looking for packing efficiencies is a critical aspect of last-mile sustainability.
Consumer packaged goods companies are also finding ways to optimize the packaging dimension that reduces the pallets used, Zimmerman said. This can allow them to fit more products on each truck, lowering the total number of trucks on the road.
Teams can further improve sustainability by considering how the final container is packaged for transit, said Tara Milburn, founder and CEO of Ethical Swag, a Certified B Corp located in Novia Scotia, that distributes promotional products. This includes making sure the box is no larger than needed and that you’ve opted for sustainable packaging.
“This can be a complex process for many companies because shipment packages come in all shapes and sizes,” Millburn said. “It takes careful thought and consideration to make sure each client’s package is thoughtfully assembled.”
Explore sustainable packaging options
The amount of cardboard and plastic trash that home deliveries generate is staggering.
For example, in 2019 alone Amazon created 465 million pounds of plastic packaging waste, according a report from Oceana, a nonprofit organization.
The report focused on Amazon since it’s the giant of e-commerce, but other companies contribute to the issue, albeit on a smaller scale, and can learn from some of the takeaways.
For example, 86% of customers worried about plastic pollution, and 87% wanted Amazon and other retail giants to take major steps to reduce plastic packaging, including offering plastic-free packaging at checkout. Clearly, creating a more sustainable last-mile delivery requires funneling investments toward new packaging approaches. Prioritizing sustainable packaging options is key.
Realize greening the last mile is complicated
By 2030, demand for last-mile deliveries is expected to grow by 78% and emissions from those are expected to grow by more than 30% in 100 cities across the globe, according to a 2020 study by the World Economic Forum.
However, by forming public-private partnerships to create infrastructure improvements, looking for opportunities to improve sustainability as quickly as possible and exploring a variety of strategies, those numbers can change and companies can help bring emissions and costs down significantly.

How and why semi-autonomous e-scooters are defining the future path of mobility?
Over the years, the automobile industry has seen a significant rise. With advances in artificial intelligence and autonomous technology, automakers are rapidly turning to driverless vehicles racing to develop autonomous cars. Not only autonomous vehicles but automobiles are also making efforts towards sustainable transportation. The development of e-scooters is a decisive stride towards long-term sustainability. Electric scooters define as the future of urban mobility. They are eco-friendly, noise-free, and pollution-free. As these scooters are already starting to gain traction, many e-scooter makers are now building semi-autonomous e-scooters that can drive autonomously with the least human intervention.
Understanding Semi-Autonomous Vehicles
Semi-autonomous vehicles are those vehicles that require the least human intervention. They typically use advanced driver assistant technologies to minimize the effort required to manoeuvre the vehicle.
Concerns around enhanced safety and security are relentlessly powering the customers’ demand for semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicle technologies. The adoption of these technologies may differ in different regions. The economically advanced countries, or developing countries, have already adopted semi-autonomous and autonomous technologies. For example, Blind Spot Detection (BSD), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Adaptive Front Lights (AFL), Intelligent Park Assist (IPA) and Lane Keep Assist (LKA).
Semi-Autonomous E-scooters
Electric scooters, dockless, shared bikes and other vehicle types are significantly reducing the physical footprint needed to move people from one place to another, over relatively short distances. These vehicle services are known as micro-mobility, and these services have resonated with consumers, as evinced by their rapid adoption over just the last several months.
As electric scooters are becoming ubiquitous in the modern transportation ecosystem, giving them some sort of autonomy makes a considerable change in the e-scooter landscape.
In August 2019, Beijing-based e-scooter maker Segway Ninebot unveiled a new e-scooter that can drive autonomously to its charging stations. The e-scooter, dubbed as KickScooter T60, has reportedly been said to be controlled remotely from the cloud. In a chat with Reuters, Ninebot chairman and CEO Gao Lufeng explained that “AI-driven e-scooters could lower operators’ costs of maintenance and improve the economics of scooter sharing.”
In 2018, more than 85,000 dockless electric scooters hit streets in the United States. These e- scooters were rented for 38.5 million trips, making them the most prevalent form of shared micro-mobility, according to the National Association of City Transportation. This increasing growth and popularity of these scooters indicate the future of electric scooters is here to stay.
Flo Mobility, a Bengaluru-based two-wheeler autonomous vehicle developer, is harnessing the power of autonomous technology. The company is building semi-autonomous e-scooters, utilizing computer vision capabilities, artificial intelligence for obstacle identification, robotics and the Internet of Things sub-systems.
Giving Autonomy to E-Scooters
Key players in the electric scooter scenario understand the value of autonomous technologies that are worth pursuing. Tortoise, an autonomous delivery company, builds technology that coalesces driverless and remote-controlled features. These features can be integrated into any vehicle type – e-scooter, and shared, dockless vehicles. The purpose behind this is to allow rentable scooters and bikes that are currently being scattered around cities to self-deploy where needed to more readily match supply to demand, simplifying retrieval, charging, and replacement. Autonomous vehicles that move without direct human intervention will significantly ease the major logistical burden of companies. They will also reduce clutter on streets and sidewalks for cities.
Some of the top e-scooter companies and startups in the world are Lime, Bird, Tier, Bounce, Voi Technology, Ather Energy, Wheels, Wind Mobility, Dott, Scoot, Hero Electric, Etergo, and others.

Alphabet’s Google cut fuel use and traffic delays by 10 per cent to 20 per cent at four locations in Israel by using artificial intelligence to optimise signal lights and it next plans to test the software in Rio de Janeiro, the company said on Wednesday (Oct 6).
The early-phase research project is among new software initiatives inside Google to combat climate change. Some employees as well as advocacy groups have called on the company, the world’s third-most valuable, to more urgently use its influence to combat the crisis.
While Google has not addressed critics’ calls to stop selling technology to oil companies or funding lawmakers who deny global warming, it has prioritised sustainability features.
Google plans in the coming weeks to allow its Nest thermostat users to buy renewable energy credits for US$10 a month to offset emissions from heating and cooling. Credits will come from projects in Texas including Bethel Wind Farm and Roseland Solar. A majority of the funds will go toward credit purchases and utility-bill payment costs, Google said, without elaborating on the remainder.
For no charge across the United States, Nest users soon can automatically shift heating and cooling to times when energy is cleaner.
New informational panels alongside search results show emissions or other environmental ratings of flights globally and cars and home appliances in the United States. To stem misinformation, English, Spanish and French queries mentioning “climate change” starting this month will feature explanations from the United Nations.
Based on early results in Israel’s Haifa and Beer-Sheva, Rio de Janeiro’s municipal traffic authority expressed high hopes for the AI to better time traffic signal changes. It told Reuters the system should be introduced within months with locations announced soon.
Aleksandar Stevanovic, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, said simulations show AI could smooth traffic flow. But he questioned whether a tech company without traffic engineering expertise ultimately could bring such software to reality.
“Every year there is someone new claiming we can do wonders,” he said.

Multiple companies are working on new aerial modes of transportation, be they taxis that fly, drones that drive, or cars that drive and fly. What most of these vehicles have in common is that they’re intended for just a few people to ride in at once, like airborne Ubers. But a New York-based startup is thinking bigger, quite literally: Kelekona is developing an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle that will be able to transport 40 people at once.
The aircraft’s design is sleek and futuristic, with a flat shape not unlike a UFO. But for all the apparent flare of the design, Kelekona’s founder, Braeden Kelekona, actually has practicality on the brain; he told Digital Trends, “We have a really small airspace in New York. It never made sense to us to create a small aircraft that was only able to carry up to six people. You have to have the kind of mass transit we rely on here in the city. It makes sense to try to move as many people as possible in one aircraft, so that we’re not hogging airspace.”
He’s got a point. There’s a lot more space in the sky than on the ground, obviously, but flight paths need to be carefully planned and contained within specific areas, particularly in and near big cities. If flying taxis became affordable enough for people to use them the way we use Uber and Lyft today, there would quickly be all sorts of issues with traffic and congestion, both in the sky and with takeoff and landing space on the ground. So why not take a scaled approach from the beginning?
Speaking of affordability, Kelekona says that’s a priority, too. It may play out differently, especially in the technology’s early stages, but the intention is for tickets on the drone bus to cost the same as a train ticket for an equivalent distance. The first route, from Manhattan to the Hamptons, will reportedly have a 30-minute flight time and an $85 ticket price.
Other intended routes include Los Angeles to San Francisco, New York City to Washington DC, and London to Paris—all in an hour, which is comparable to the time it takes for a regular flight right now. One of the differences, ideally, will be that the eVTOLs will be able to land and take off closer to city centers, given that they won’t require long runways.
For this same reason, the company also envisions a streamlined approach to connecting warehouses; its aircraft will be able to carry 12 to 24 shipping containers, or a 10,000-pound cargo payload.
Moving that much weight, plus the weight of the aircraft itself, will demand a lot of battery power. The aircraft’s body will be made of 3D printed composite and aluminum and equipped with eight thrust vectoring fans with propellors whose pitch can change for the different stages of flight: vertical takeoff, forward flight, and landing. All of this will be built around a giant modular battery pack.
“Instead of building an interesting airframe and then trying to figure out how to put the battery into that aircraft, we started with the battery first and put things on top of it,” Kelekona said. The battery pack will have 3.6 megawatt hours of capacity, and will be built for easy swapping out with new iterations as battery technology continues to improve. The aircraft’s energy requirements will likely be the biggest challenge Kelekona faces in its design, production, and launch; at present, the aircraft is still in the computer simulation phase.
A British company called GKN Aerospace is developing a similar concept. Announced in February, Skybus would fit 30 to 50 passengers, and is intended for “mass transit over extremely congested routes.” Despite being made for vertical takeoff and landing, though, the aircraft design has large wings on either side; this would make it more challenging to find adaptable space in urban areas.

Self-driving vehicles won’t be widely viable commercially until their AI guidance systems are better than human drivers and can adjust to unpredictable road circumstances.
By Esther Ajao

When electric car giant Tesla recently introduced a beta of it latest full self-driving software then withdrew it, the abrupt reversal encapsulated the stop-start state of autonomous vehicle technology.
In a tweet on Oct. 23 about the withdrawal of the system, Tesla CEO and founder Elon Musk said it’s impossible at this point to test all configurations of a fully self-driving vehicle.
That dilemma is at the heart of the fitful progress on autonomous vehicle technology by major automakers such as Ford, General Motors and Hyundai, and tech giants including Apple, Google’s Waymo subsidiary and Amazon’s Zoox robotaxi subsidiary.
The industry must also overcome daunting challenges in ensuring safety.
While Tesla cars now have only limited autonomous capabilities, the company has made significant advancements, including putting cars on the road with limited self-driving features.
But some experts say Tesla’s chief limitations stem from a sensor suite that is not quite diverse enough. And different iterations of that problem also afflict other developers of autonomous vehicle technology.
Tesla relies on mainly cameras and software to perform all aspects of sensing the environment surrounding the car, leaving its level of autonomy at what is known in the industry as level 2, meaning the driver’s hands must always be on the wheel. Others in the industry that are developing level 3 or 4 technology (vehicles that don’t require limited help from the driver or don’t require a safety driver) are using a combination of cameras, software, lidar, radar and updateable HD maps.
“The advantage to adding these additional sensor modalities is that it provides redundancy across environmental conditions … and road types, and provide[s] an alternative method to distinguish certain roadway elements and actors,” said Matt Arcaro, an analyst at IDC.
Advances in autonomous vehicle technology
A prominent vendor in this area is Waymo. The Google subsidiary runs a self-driving taxi service in a section of Phoenix.
The vendor is also working on using the technology in other areas such as trucking, logistics and personal vehicles. Recently Waymo and GM’s Cruise division were the first autonomous vehicle technology vendors to obtain autonomous vehicle permits in California that would allow them to transport passengers.
Other promising projects involve traditional and new automotive manufacturers working on autonomous technology for robotaxis and personal vehicles.
For example, in 2019 Volkswagen said it would join Ford in investing in AI vendor Argo AI to introduce autonomous vehicle technology in the U.S. and Europe. The companies committed to spending more than $4 billion through 2023 to develop their self-driving service.
Another involves Intel subsidiary Mobileye and SIXT, a provider of mobility services in Germany; the vendors plan to offer robotaxis in Munich next year.
Amazon’s Zoox is designing autonomous vehicles from the ground up. The Zoox strategy is distinguished by its unique model, which is not designed like a car and doesn’t have a front or a back end or even a steering wheel.
The safety issue with autonomous vehicles
Despite the advances in the technology and interest in it from the public and enterprises, the autonomous vehicle industry is still up against many challenges, chief among them safety.
Although the industry is making progress in trying to make sure the technology is safe, regulation that could enforce safety requirements is largely absent, and it is mostly unclear still how local authorities will administer laws and regulations governing the use of autonomous vehicles.
Some states have enacted legislation for autonomous vehicles. Nevada requires manufacturers to meet detailed testing and safety rules; maintain a $5 million insurance policy to test vehicles on public roads; and, as of now, place a safety driver on board.
“If it’s vague out there that you’re relying on each individual provider to come up with their own definition of safety, that’s not the right way to do it,” Arcaro said.
And if autonomous vehicles are not as safe or even safer than human drivers, then there’s no point to them, said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Guidehouse.
Abuelsamid noted that while human drivers are criticized for being responsible for most crashes, people are good at driving and most of the time they drive, they don’t crash.
“We have not yet proven that autonomous vehicles can do the same, especially in the more challenging conditions,” he said. “We will undoubtedly have more crashes and more fatalities with autonomous vehicles because it’s impossible to make a system that complex perfect. But if we make it better than humans, then we’ll make progress.”
The uses of autonomous vehicle technology
Another challenge with the technology is figuring out where it’s useful.
Vendors such as Waymo, Uber and Motional — a joint venture between Hyundai and autonomous vehicle technology vendor Aptiv — are using the technology to develop robotaxis.
However, the goal and challenge for businesses is to find wide applications for the technology that can help them make money.
One industry that’s crying out for autonomous vehicles is trucking, which is suffering from a widespread shortage of drivers. An autonomous vehicle out on the highway is much simpler than guiding a vehicle autonomously in the city.
Waymo’s Via system uses cameras, software, lidar and radar configured to the specific requirements of truck driving. Startup vendor Aurora has put autonomous trucks on the road with backup human drivers. However, Aurora hopes to remove the drivers by 2023 when It fully launches its trucking business.
While there appears to be a real need for autonomous vehicles in the trucking business, Arcaro said other sectors are interested too, but self-driving is not like “turning on a light switch.”
“A lot of enterprises are a little skeptical because of initial timelines, but they’re also open to the technology,” Arcaro said.
Challenges for automated driving systems
Part of the reason that enterprises are still skeptical is because while some models are being tested, autonomous vehicle technology is still firmly in the testing phase.
Driving is an extremely difficult task for AI technology to understand, according to Abuelsamid.[Driving] takes a lot of nuance and nuance is something that computers and software are actually not good at.Sam AbuelsamidAnalyst, Guidehouse
“It takes a lot of nuance, and nuance is something that computers and software are actually not good at,” he said.
One reason is because AI is not as adaptable as the human brain and can fail in unpredictable ways.
The task of an automated driving system is broken down into four major steps:
The first step is sensing and perception, using a software system on top of a sensor array including cameras, radar, lidar and ultrasonic sensors. The sensors look at the world around the vehicle to detect what’s around it — in much the same way humans use their five senses to understand objects and distinguish them from each other.
The next step is to make sense of what all the different objects around the vehicle are. After that, the technology must be able to predict what the objects — including pedestrians, bicyclists, other vehicles and roadway items — might do within three to five seconds.
After the prediction, the next step is to plan a path for a vehicle to drive through that environment.
The final step is control. This is where the system sends signals to the steering and brakes and accelerator to make the car or truck go where it needs to.
“Perception is really hard for software,” Abuelsamid said. “AI systems can actually be fooled by subtle changes.”
One of the thorniest problems for autonomous vehicle technology is the prediction phase. While it might be easy for the autonomous vehicle to understand what other vehicles could do, pedestrians are relatively unpredictable and can easily change their minds at any moment.
“So, it has taken longer to create autonomous vehicles that can operate reliably in the kinds of environments with which humans have few problems,” Abuelsamid said.
For engineers, it’s about being able to manage and deploy a system that can support not only 99% of what is predictable, but also the small fraction that is unpredictable, Arcaro said.
“That last one percent is very difficult,” he continued. “That’s what’s keeping cars off the road today.”
The possible workaround
Some vendors are already finding ways around these problems and taking multiple pathways, Abuelsamid said.
They are deploying multiple algorithms instead of just one for perception. Rather than having software rely on cameras, lidar or radar, developers are using them all together. In some cases, vendors use both a deterministic approach and a probabilistic approach in their development of autonomous vehicles.
The deterministic approach is traditional and rules-based, Abuelsamid said. This is when an input signal to the algorithm will always yield the same result and the algorithm’s path is fully traceable.
“This is a well understood and reliable but sometimes limited approach,” Abuelsamid said
The probabilistic or AI approach uses complex models with many parameters that are often determined by the algorithm itself with a training process in which known, labeled data is fed to the algorithm.
The subsets within this category includes machine learning or neural networks. The algorithms will usually produce a probable answer about the likelihood that an object is a pedestrian or a vehicle According to Abuelsamid, the systems tend to be brittle and can sometimes give the wrong response in unexpected ways.
Making algorithms reliable
Most developers are now combining both approaches and breaking their software down into smaller chunks so that even if a specific algorithm can’t be traced, the problem can be isolated.
“By using all of those together, you can mix and match them in different ways so that you can verify what you think the system can verify … and have a more accurate result,” Abuelsamid continued. “Having that redundancy built in really turned out to be really important to have a safe and reliable system.”
Another way vendors are trying to attack this problem is by focusing on one industry. While some vendors zero in on the robotaxi industry, others are looking at the delivery industry.
As some focus on trucking on highways because it’s simpler than driving in the city and doesn’t contain many intersections, others are reining in the scope of their version of autonomous vehicle technology by geography, location or weather conditions.
“What we’re seeing now are companies that are limiting the problem set in some way, and having a limited design domain,” Abuelsamid said.
One autonomous vehicle vendor that has been somewhat successful in constraining the problem set is Motional. Motional transports passengers in Las Vegas through a partnership with Lyft. The company said it has conducted more than 100,000 public rides with two safety drivers in the front seat.
Earlier this year, Motional began testing driverless vehicles in Las Vegas after a two-year safety evaluation period and testing self-driving taxis with a safety driver. The company says it will launch a driverless service in 2023 through its partnership with Lyft, without a safety driver.
The Motional method
Meanwhile, Motional is still working to ensure its technology can handle unpredictable situations without a safety driver.
The vendor is using a machine learning-first approach and a continuous learning framework, said Sammy Omari, vice president of engineering and head of autonomy.
The continuous learning framework automatically detects unusual situations or objects, produces training data automatically in the Motional system and enables engineers and data scientists to retrain quickly and redeploy if the performance evaluation is good enough in simulation.
“This automatic loop allows us to get better, build a better autonomy and handle these kinds of rare situations better with every single mile we drive,” Omari said.
Motional also uses the continuous learning framework to mine for unexpected situations and determine if its prediction system is responding correctly.
If the prediction system does not respond correctly, Omari said, that data is put into the training data that is used to train the model or system. In some cases, the data may also be placed into the model validation set and used to re-create simulation scenarios.
One challenge Motional faces with the continuous learning approach is that it’s working with a large volume of data, as well as hundreds of cars that are out on the road every day.
Processing all that data, pushing it into the cloud and mining for relevant scenarios to create the training and retraining data is also challenging. Another hurdle to overcome is to keep the costs of doing all that for each vehicle under control.
“If you want to pull the safety driver out, you need to have the confidence that you have the right behavior of hundreds or thousands and millions of files,” Omari said.

-There are an estimated 975,000 telematics insurance policies active in the UK, according to the latest figures from TheBritish Insurance Brokers’ Association (2018) out of approximately 33 million registered cars.
-Telematics car insurance is a way to track and score someone’s driving and thus decide how much to charge you for car insurance.
-This is particularly important for young drivers who would otherwise face high or unaffordable car insurance premiums.
-Young drivers, careful drivers and low mileage drivers can save up to 60% at renewal by installing a telematics product in their car, which reports the quality of their driving back to the insurance provider via GPS.  In fact, it is predicted 88% of new cars will carry integrated telematics within five years.
– insurethebox proactively communicates with its policyholders who display risky driving behaviours, providing them with the information they need to improve their driving. Amongst its communications is their award-winning Speed Reduction Programme,  which has seen upwards of 86,000 drivers reduce their speed by 22%, leading to a 6% reduction in accident frequency amongst its customers – helping to prevent an estimated 1,191 accidents and a further 50 serious injuries in the past 5 years
-Warren Hetz, UK CEO of Aioi Nissay Dowa Europe, parent company of insurethebox comments: “Our telematics products have long-provided an opportunity for drivers to improve their driving behaviour and earn rewards by providing a level of insight unavailable with traditional insurance. As a business, we observe the benefits of safer driving by our customers on a daily basis, and through this partnership with one of the UK’s pioneers in the insurance comparison space, we endeavour to expand our reach and provide these benefits to more drivers, of all ages.”

Across Australia and around the globe, Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) are already making road travel safer, more efficient and more sustainable. Such systems are only becoming more and more relevant as population grows and the number of vehicles on the roads increases, with various ITS technologies offering solutions to decrease congestion, increase efficiency and mobility, and even save lives.
Fundamentally, ITS involves integrating information and communication technologies into transport systems to optimize operations. ITS encompass a broad range of systems and technologies, with varying levels of complexity and automation.
While smart systems can be applied to any form of transport, the term ITS is most frequently used in reference to road transport. The ‘currency’ of any ITS is its data, which is used to improve the transport system’s operations, often in real time.
As such, ITS employs a variety of wired or wireless technologies to collect, transmit, communicate and interpret data, with many also including automated control functions.
ITS infrastructure may involve technologies integrated into road networks (e.g. roadside sensors), within the vehicles themselves, or both. Essentially, ITS enhances connections between road users, vehicles, road infrastructure and transport system operators.
ITS solutions are generally applied to do one or more of the following:
Improve the mobility of people or goodsIncrease safetyReduce traffic congestion and increase transport efficiencyInform road users of conditionsRespond effectively to incidents and emergenciesIncrease the resiliency of the transport system in case of changed conditions or unforeseen disruptionsReduce air pollution or improve energy efficiencyAutomate billing processesAchieve policy objectives (such as demand management or transport priority)
Its infrastructure in action
ITS fulfill various vital functions on our roads, reaping significant benefits for road users and operators, as well as for our broader society and economy.
Traffic management
ITS traffic management is concerned with the overall management of traffic on a road. The ITS detects traffic situations and deploys traffic control strategies. Technology is applied to traffic signalling systems, traffic safety, and route and congestion management.
For example, the busiest roads around Melbourne, including the M80 Ring Road, Tullamarine, West Gate and Monash freeways, Eastlink and Citylink, use coordinated dynamic ramp metering to measure and regulate the number of vehicles entering and exiting in real time.
This enables each road to handle the maximum number of vehicles while maintaining traffic flow, reducing travel times and preventing safety issues associated with congestion.
Controlling traffic signals to only allow a certain number of vehicles to merge onto a road at a time helps break up groups of vehicles that might otherwise be competing for space, reducing the likelihood of collisions. Ramp metering signals that become operational during peak times have also been deployed as part of Sydney’s $600 million M4 Smart Motorway project.
Similarly, ITS such as the Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS) employ in-pavement detectors and other sensors at busy intersections to monitor demand for right-of-way and shifts in direction of demand.
Traffic signals then adapt accordingly, resulting in a smoother flow of traffic and minimising wait times. The SCATS Priority Engine also allows essential vehicles (such as emergency services) to be prioritised through traffic lights.
In Queensland, Hold the Red, an innovative intersection crash avoidance system trialled at four intersections in Brisbane and the Gold Coast, demonstrates the potential of ITS to prevent traffic incidents and enhance safety. The system uses radar to predict when a vehicle approaching the intersection is going to run a red light.
When this occurs, the system extends the all-red phases of lights at the intersection by two seconds, preventing other vehicles or pedestrians from entering the intersection where they could collide with the offending vehicle.
Traveller information
A common function of ITS technology is to better inform road users about road, environment and traffic conditions. These services enable road users to plan the most efficient route, avoid delays and quickly become aware of any changed conditions, potential hazards or emergency situations.
For instance, signs may display current travel times or advise of incidents or lane closures, or real-time information about conditions might be conveyed via highway advisory radio or reflected in GPS data.
Real-time traffic information signs and variable message signs are employed on a variety of roads around Australia, while certain busy car parks use parking guidance systems to advise of parking availability.
For example, the Parramatta Parking Finder helps support people with accessibility issues by providing information about accessible parking spaces around the Parramatta CBD including photos of the space and a rating out of five for the size of the space, hoist suitability and kerb ramp access.
Some of the potential benefits of ITS integrated with connected and semi-autonomous vehicles have been demonstrated by a trial undertaken by the Victorian Department of Transport on Eastlink, which involved the operational deployment of semi-AVs and cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS).
The project developed a DSRC messaging platform that delivered real-time road warnings in a high-speed environment, with high reliability and precision (to location and lane), without interfering with the existing tolling system.
Emergency management and response
The real-time monitoring capabilities of ITS can greatly reduce emergency response times, saving lives, preventing secondary incidents and reducing disruptions.
For instance, if a collision occurs, the relevant authorities are alerted, and the nearest emergency vehicle is located and dispatched to the scene.
Other drivers on the road can be alerted through dynamic signage and signals may change to prevent too many vehicles entering the area of the accident until it is safe to do so.
In South Australia, on the section of the North-South Corridor between Torrens Road and River Torrens, a Thermal Video Incident Detection System detects slowing, stopped or wrong direction vehicles within 5-15 seconds, fast-tracking incident response actions.
These include notifying drivers of lane closures and congestion using variable message signs and monitoring the situation with CCTV pan-tilt-zoom cameras.
Meanwhile, the Queensland Police Service employs drones and motorcycles to expedite serious crash scene clearance times, allowing traffic managers to estimate the duration and severity of congestion impacts and use existing ITS technologies to help manage congestion and prevent secondary incidents.
Using drone technology to map crash scenes, the Forensic Crash Unit has reduced scene mapping time by 50 per cent, reducing road closure times and traffic congestion, while also improving the quality of evidence captured at scenes.
In Brisbane, a structural health monitoring system has been developed to detect damage to the iconic old Sir Leo Hielscher Bridge (the Gateway Bridge) in real time, before it can affect public safety. These are just some of the ways in which ITS are currently transforming Australian road travel, with much more to come.
As the field of ITS continues to develop rapidly, the deployment of smart systems on our roads can help address significant social, economic and environmental issues.
With the costs of congestion predicted to rise to as much as $40 billion by 2030, and over a thousand lives still lost on our roads each year, we cannot afford to miss this opportunity to reap significant benefits at a relatively low cost, leveraging data to revolutionise road transport.

 A pause in one of the largest transit systems in the U.S. inspired an award-winning pilot project to improve public transportation. 
 By Steve Mazur

Throughout America’s history, cities that have invested in a reliable and robust network of roads, bridges and public transportation have been key to the growth of the nation’s economy.
Take Chicago, for example. The city ranks third in economic output in the country. Chicago is home to one of the best and largest public transit systems, second only to New York City’s.
Before the coronavirus pandemic, the Chicago Transit Authority reported bus and rail ridership totaled 455.7 million rides in 2019 (237.3 million bus rides and 218.4 million rail rides). In 2020, ridership plummeted amid the pandemic, particularly during March, April and May.
By the end of 2020, the CTA reported bus and rail ridership had risen to 197.5 million (121.5 million bus rides and 76.0 million rail rides). While this reflects a 57.6 percent average drop in ridership from 2019, it is a steady climb from its lowest point during lockdowns, when most city buses and trains were empty.
Restoring ridership to pre-pandemic levels has presented a major challenge for cities across the country, and Chicago is no exception. According to the CTA, 1.6 million bus and train rides are taken on an average weekday across the regional CTA transit system that serves the greater metropolitan region, inclusive of the city and 35 suburbs. Certain routes operate around-the-clock.
Because it is viewed as the circulatory system driving the economic vitality of Chicago, the CTA recognized the urgent need for a way to collect and analyze vehicle capacity in order to optimize routes, increase rider comfort and improve the passenger experience —all cornerstones to bringing riders back.
Chicago Gets Real-Time Data to Improve Transit Service 
As is the case for many transit agencies, much of the CTA’s data on transit vehicle capacity was incomplete, not available in real time or based on historic averages that may or may not reflect current realities, especially in the face of changing public health guidelines.
Without accurate real-time occupancy data and demand forecasts, the CTA had no insight into when and where to adjust service to ensure efficiency and reliability, appropriate social distancing, and shorter wait times.
To leverage its existing data and collect new data through advanced technology, the CTA turned to City Tech Collaborative, a Chicago-based urban solutions accelerator, which spearheaded a passenger-counting pilot project to understand vehicle occupancy in real time. The pilot was deployed on 10 buses from March to August along the CTA’s 79th Street bus route, one of the agency’s busiest, measuring the efficacy of various passenger-counting technologies.
The pilot served several purposes:
Capturing demand and using data from existing bus video assetsUsing data management tools to support CTA operationsApplying analytics and predictive models for proactive demand management
Building on the CTA’s existing measures and passenger-counting technology to keep bus and train service timely, efficient and safe, City Tech and an ecosystem of partners implemented video analytics, onboard cameras and routers to provide real-time insights into occupancy across multiple vehicles.
The pilot project recently received the IoT Deployment of the Year Award from IoT World Today, demonstrating the value of IoT technology in helping the CTA proactively meet route ridership demand; reduce passenger crowding and wait times; and provide a safe, socially distanced rider experience.
How to Streamline Technology Within Transit Agencies
A forthcoming report from the CTA will show how this model holds great potential for solving current challenges within core functions of society, as well as for building a solid foundation for future operations that prioritize the greater good.
Over the years, transit agencies have gradually added different applications and systems to their fleets of vehicles, such as:
Fare collection and payment terminal backhaulComputer-aided dispatch and automatic vehicle location (CAD/AVL)High-speed passenger internet accessPassenger countersClosed-circuit security camerasRemote engine diagnostics and fuel consumptionVehicle telematics, including information on speed and idle timeDigital maps, signage and advertising
However, implementing these applications and systems in a cost-effective way has been challenging. The municipal authority may have started with GPS navigation and vehicle tracking CAD/AVL systems, then later added onboard and in-terminal payment systems that needed backhaul to the central office. Then came passenger Wi-Fi, digital signage, security cameras and more.
The result for many transit agencies was a multitude of systems that do not integrate with one another and do not use the same internet connectivity methods and cellular carriers.
For municipalities already burdened with managing large fleets while maintaining an IT infrastructure on a tight budget, the challenges can stack up. With even more hardware, software and connectivity to maintain and manage, the risk of system failure only increases. The better answer is to consolidate all vehicle connectivity through a single, robust connection platform.
As unpredictability becomes the new norm, the future of transit belongs to agencies, operators and authorities that can leverage smart, secure and cost-efficient connectivity to improve the rider experience, lower costs, and improve safety and performance. In doing so, they invest in the continued economic growth of their cities as well as the American economy.

While Phoenix travel guides may not mention this, taking a ride in Waymo’s self-driving car should be at the forefront of that list. Travel the city via a fully autonomous vehicle you can book simply with an app on your phone.
Waymo, Google’s platform for driverless vehicles, provides fully autonomous cars seven days a week all around Phoenix. Dubbed ‘the World’s Most Experienced Driver’ by Alphabet AI, Waymo has driven over 20 billion miles so far, with the sole mission to make travelling easier and safer. In 2020, Alphabet expanded the tech to commercial trucks. 
Waymo calls itself a self-driving technology company rather than a self-driving car company. Their fleet of thousands of self-driving cars is powered with sensors like lidar, enabling driver-free operations and 360-degree perception technology to identify obstacles. 
Waymo, back in October 2020, announced its plan of launching fully driverless vehicles to the public. It is wholly focused on full autonomy. “We’re building systems that operate without any reliance on human drivers. Either the system can complete the entire trip, or it cannot,” the team at Waymo explained. 
In this article, we break down how Waymo leverages AI/ML to create their dominating technology. 
Territory Marking & Prediction
Before operating in a new area, the Waymo Driver maps the territory with a high detailing rate. This includes noting the stop signs or the curbs, and the platform adopts these into custom maps equipped with real-time sensor data. This information is later mixed with real-time details to gauge how the road users might behave and drive accordingly. 
Advanced Sensors
Waymo has claimed to have built the most advanced sensors and perception systems with quality data. The system dataset contains more than 20 million autonomously driven miles and five generations of development. 
Its fifth-generation Driver comprises complementary sensors that include radar, lidar, and cameras that allow it to see 360 degrees around the vehicle. This considers the time of the day, bad weather conditions like rain or fog, and the variety of road users such as those double-parked vehicles whose riders can hop out at any second or the scooters cutting across traffic through a red light.
Waymo Blog Post A dense and highly detailed 3D view of its surroundings as generated by the system’s lidar
These sensors allow the vehicle to navigate the city streets accurately and track objects around, especially while taking turns or changing lanes. “Because of the long-range and high density provided by our sensors, the Waymo Driver can detect with high accuracy, and intelligently reason about small objects and movement at distances – such as spotting a truck door slowly opening in the flow of traffic as a person gets ready to hop out and deliver some packages,” according to Waymo’s blog post.
Waymo’s compute platform allows the Driver to process vast amounts of data and run real-time inference on large ML models. This will enable it to react immediately without additional human input, like when an emergency vehicle is approaching or when a dog runs out into the street. They even do this without needing a cell signal to operate.
Software and Training Structure
Waymo’s driving software is based on years of AI research, their Waymo Open Dataset Initiative, and research team Google Brain. The engineers working at Waymo operate in coordination with the Google Brain team to apply deep nets to the car’s pedestrian detection system. 
The team has created a robust, generalisable tech stack based on their operation in multiple environments and cities. The Waymo Driver has learnt to behave assertively and merge into traffic based on this experience. 
Waymo has invested in creating training softwares for the Waymo Driver. The Simulation City is software to test the autonomous vehicles and assess their performance for the cities Waymo is present in. It creates realistic conditions like spring showers, solar glare, or dimming light for the technology to experience; the researchers further learn from the system’s reactions.

Waymo blog post: an illustration of how the Simulation City draws a random outcome from a statistical distribution of the real world. 
The Waymo Driver itself is trained with a highly nuanced understanding of city roads with driving experience of more than 20 million miles on public roads and 20 million miles in simulation. It can adapt to the local driving conditions accurately, given this training.
For instance, in San Francisco, the system has learnt that the residents often drive slower on steep slopes and adapt to change its speed depending on traffic flow. Waymo Driver makes similar calculations while approaching crosswalks or lower visibility areas.
Tensorflow Ecosystem
Waymo has adopted the TensorFlow ecosystem and the data centres of Google, such as TPUs, for training its neural networks. Their rigorous testing on simulations and training cycles allows it to enhance its ML and autonomous system.
SurfelGAN 
The platform is leveraging AI to generate camera images to simulate sensor data gathered through its self-driving vehicles.  
In a recent paper, the researchers introduced the technique – SurfelGAN. This uses texture-mapped surface elements for reconstructing scenes and camera viewpoints to handle positions and orientations. This is a considerably more accessible and more data-driven path to simulate sensor data. The AI generates and preserves data based on real-world lidar sensors and camera feeds. This data is regarding the semantics, 3D geometry, and object appearances on the scene used to render a simulated scene through the reconstruction. 
Currently, Waymo is the only company operating a fully autonomous public ride-hailing service in the U.S. They have partnered with many car manufacturers like Jaguar Land Rover or Volvo to integrate the self-driving technology into their vehicles and with OEMs to expose their Driver to more places and people.

						Waymo will start by mapping the city in preparation to deploy its fully self-driving vehicles.
											
					
Alphabet Inc’s autonomous driving arm Waymo,  which spun out of Google’s self-driving car project, is deploying its  autonomous vehicles in New York City. Beginning tomorrow, Waymo’s  mapping vehicles start mapping the city in preparation for a more  widespread deployment of fully-autonomous vehicles.
As
 one of the most densely populated cities in the world, New York poses 
difficult challenges for Waymo’s self-driving vehicles. The city’s 
streets are clogged with cars, pedestrians, bicyclists and delivery 
vehicles. 
Waymo plans to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service in major U.S. cities called “Waymo One“,  which is similar to Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing providers. More  recently, Waymo has been testing its autonomous vehicles in San  Francisco. 
“Autonomous vehicles hold the 
promise to dramatically improve traffic flow and expand access to 
convenient and affordable transportation for millions of New Yorkers,” 
said newly elected NYC mayor Eric Adams. “I’m excited to welcome Waymo 
to New York so that one day we can have safe autonomous technology on 
our streets.”
To successfully navigate in  this challenging environment, the first steps for Waymo are to fully map  the streets of New York City, since the company’s fleet of autonomous  vehicles relies on high-definition maps with centimeter-level accuracy for safe navigation.  These HD maps allow Waymo’s vehicles to navigate in places even where  GPS signals are spotty, such as in tunnels or between skyscrapers.
With
 the backing of Google over the years, Waymo has emerged as a leading 
developer of self-driving technology. The company’s fleet of autonomous 
vehicles has traveled over 20 million miles on public roads
 in cities across the U.S., with billions of more miles in computer 
simulation to perfect its autonomous driving platform that Waymo calls 
the “Waymo Driver.”
For the time being, 
Waymo’s mapping vehicles in New York will be manually operated by 
autonomous specialists at all times, the company said.
Testing  its vehicle in New York City will allow Waymo will give Waymo  opportunities to learn more about how its Waymo Driver handles urban  driving in snow, rain and other winter weather conditions. By assessing  the way Waymo vehicles perform in inclimate weather, Waymo will be able  to make improvements to its software based on real world scenarios, then  apply these learnings across its entire fleet.
Waymo’s
 New York fleet, which will start with five Chrysler Pacifica minivans 
outfitted with hardware to support autonomous driving and mapping 
capabilities, will primarily operate south of Central Park. Waymo said 
its areas of operation will extend down through the city to the 
Financial District and the southern end of Manhattan, as well as out to a
 small section of New Jersey through the Lincoln Tunnel, which connects 
New York to New Jersey across the Hudson River.
Waymo
 will also be driving its zero-emission Jaguar I-PACEs electric SUVs 
equipped with its latest technology on the same streets in Manhattan. 
The company said the insights gathered will help the Waymo Driver improve its ability to perceive and predict the actions of other road users in dense urban areas.
“The  more information we gather about the way our city moves, the closer we  get to creating a more efficient, sustainable, and safe mobility  network.” said Tech:NYC Executive Director Julie Samuels. “NYC is  excited to welcome Waymo to New York to help us learn how our streets —  from bike and bus lanes to highways and walkways — really work.”
In August, the Waymo One service opened to a select group of “trusted testers” in San Francisco.
 The company was recently approved to begin picking up passengers in its
 driverless vehicles for the first time, after years of extensive 
testing using safety drivers behind the wheel.
Waymo’s
 Trusted Tester pilot is a research-focused program that invites San 
Francisco residents to participate and help the company shape the future
 of fully autonomous ride-hailing. Waymo takes valuable feedback from 
its trusted testers to continuously improve its service. 
Prior to opening Waymo One to its trusted testers, the company was picking up its own employees in the city.
Just  like Uber and Lyft, the Waymo One service has a smartphone app where  customers can summon one of the company’s self-driving vehicles. Once  seated and bucked up, riders press the trip start button to begin their  trip. A monitor installed in the backseat of each vehicle shows the  vehicle’s perception systems in real time and riders get an expanded  look at what the self-driving vehicle “sees” as it navigates  autonomously in the city.
Riders also have a
 pull over button in case a passenger needs to cut their trip short. If a
 rider presses the button, the Waymo vehicles will pull over in a safe 
location and let them out.
Prior to 
launching the Waymo One service in San Francisco for select riders, the 
company has been testing its technology in the Phoenix Metro Area since 
2016, mapping streets and improving its self-driving software for the 
Waymo One ride-hailing service.
In September, Waymo and Cruise LLC, the autonomous driving unit of automaker General Motors, were
 issued permits by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to 
deploy their commercial self-driving vehicles in San Francisco and pick up paying customers.
The  permits pave the way for a more broader deployment of the Waymo One  autonomous ride-hailing services in the San Francisco Bay Area and in  other major cities like New York.

Chinese
 technology company Baidu Inc. is one of the world’s leading developers 
of autonomous driving technology with its open Apollo platform. In 
addition to developing an entire mobility ecosystem in China around self-driving vehicles,
 the company is working directly with three of China’s biggest 
automakers to install its autonomous driving hardware during the 
production phase, as opposed to modifying the vehicles after assembly. 
The
 vehicles are being mass produced by the three of China leading 
automakers, GAC, WM Motor and SAIC Group, to serve as robotaxis for 
Baidu’s “Apollo Go” ride-hailing service.
On Oct 26, Baidu launched the third of these “Apollo Moon”  robotaxis based on an electric SUV from AION, the new electric  sub-brand of Chinese automaker GAC which launched in 2018. The EV comes  with Baidu’s factory-installed autonomous driving system and is referred  to by Baidu as the “Apollo Moon AION version”.
The
 Apollo Moon AION SUV is built on the latest version of GAC’s GEP (GAC 
Electric Platform), which is designed for purely electric vehicles. It 
will accelerate the application of L4 autonomous driving and drive the 
era of shared mobility, according to Baidu.
“The  launch of Apollo Moon is an important breakthrough signifying the  powerful linkage between China’s leading autonomous driving technology  and the most advanced smart vehicle platform, marking a landmark step in  the field of robotaxi ride-hailing services globally,” said Li Zhenyu,  senior vice-president at Baidu.
The AION 
robotaxi is the third production vehicle from three different automakers
 that Baidu has added its autonomous driving hardware to. The other two 
are the Apollo Moon Arcfox from automaker BAIC Group’s electric sub 
brand Arcfox, which was released in June, and the Apollo Moon WM Motor, 
which is based on the W6 SUV from chinese automaker WM Motor. The W6 was
 officially launched on Oct 19.
The W6 from
 WM Motor is equipped with 12 cameras, 5 millimeter-wave radars and 12 
ultrasonic radars with L2+ autonomous driving capabilities. Baidu says 
its Apollo platform supports autonomous driving in dense urban areas as 
well as highway driving. 
Integrating 
Baidu’s Apollo autonomous driving technology in a production vehicle 
involved an R&D investment of 3 billion yuan ($469.91 million), 
according to Chinese news outlet Gasgoo. The platform features both autonomous driving software and hardware integration.
The
 Apollo Moon AION includes a customer-built LiDAR unit, a fully 
redundant design for added safety. If any sensors fail, the entire 
vehicle still executes autonomous driving commands and delivers 
passengers to a safe dropoff location.
Since  its based on a dedicated EV platform that supports better hardware  integration, the Apollo Moon AION features lower manufacturing cost per  car than that of the former-generation cars, while its overall  autonomous driving capabilities have been improved.
Baidu’s  Apollo Moon vehicles also use its “ANP-Robotaxi” architecture, which  can reduce the weight of autonomous vehicle hardware. The platform can  be used to share intelligent driving vehicle data with other Apollo Moon  vehicles to create a closed-loop information ecosystem that allows for  level-4 autonomous driving, which has not yet been achieved by the  industry. 
Apollo Moon also includes a 
precise failure detector and degradable processing algorithms, 
5G-powered remote monitoring services and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology.
Baidu plans to work with other automakers in the future to install its autonomous driving system in a higher number of vehicles at the factory. Baidu plans to have its Apollo intelligent driving solutions available in more than one million vehicles in the next three to five years, said Li Zhenyu, senior corporate vice president at Baidu, during a presentation in April at Auto Shanghai 2021.
Baidu’s Approach to Self-Driving Differs From Tesla and Waymo in the U.S.
Baidu’s  approach in the development of its self-driving technology differs from  that of Tesla and Alphabet’s autonomous driving division Waymo, which  spun out of Google’s self-driving car project. 
Speaking
 at the Emerging Engineering International Forum 2021, hosted by Peking 
University last week, Baidu CEO Robin Li spoke about the engineering 
mindset that drives Baidu’s business.
In 
his speech, Li shared his thoughts on how competitors like Waymo and 
Tesla approach the development of autonomous driving technology compared
 to Baidu. 
According to Li, Waymo’s  approach is a “scientific one”, aiming to achieve L5 first, then  expanding, scaling and commercializing the technology. Tesla however,  has taken an “engineering approach”, by gradually making incremental  advances in its self-driving technology. Baidu has instead prioritized  expanding the driving range of self-driving vehicles, by perfecting the  technology in a smaller geo-fenced area before expanded to a wider  region.
Li said in his speech that its 
impossible to deploy a self-driving car on the road and immediately be 
able to drive all 5 million kilometers of road in China. He says there 
are many factors that need to be tested and considered prior to 
achieving the highest level of safety for autonomous vehicles. 
By
 practicing the operation of self-driving cars in smaller areas where 
the conditions are more conducive to testing, Baidu argues that its able
 to gradually learn and improve its autonomous driving capabilities 
before expanding to a wider geographical area.
Baidu
 is often referred to as the “Google of China”, has been working to 
deploy commercial autonomous driving technology at scale as part of its 
open Apollo platform since 2017. The Apollo platform is designed to 
speed up the development of self-driving technology through 
collaboration with industry partners.
Since
 its launch, Apollo’s development work has grown significantly. Baidu is
 working with over 200 industry partners as part of Apollo, including 
automakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen, and hardware manufacturers Intel
 and Nvidia.
The Apollo platform is often 
referred to as the “Android of the Automotive Industry.” It’s the 
largest open-source autonomous driving platform in the world, according 
to Baidu. 
Baidu called the integration of 
its autonomous driving technology in the three Apollo Moon robotaxis “a 
monumental milestone in the large-scale commercialization of fully 
autonomous ride-hailing services in China.”
During
 the company’s annual Baidu World 2021 conference in August, Li unveiled
 his vision for mobility of the future in the form of a futuristic 
“robocar” designed to make autonomous vehicles more accessible to the 
broader public. 
The robocar features automated gull-wing doors and a transparent glass roof to  make the interior feel more spacious for passengers. Each vehicle  includes a suite of external sensors for safe navigation on public  streets. Baidu says its robocar is capable of level 5 autonomous  driving, meaning that no human intervention is ever required.
The  over design of the robocar is bold and differs from traditional vehicle  designs, with no steering wheel, pedals or other controls for a human  operator.

The world, as we know it today, bears no resemblance whatsoever to the yesteryears. Advancements in technology have disrupted every possible industry and the automotive sector is no stranger to it. There has been an increasing change in the way people look at transportation. In fact, the very term and concept is being shifted from ‘transportation’ to ‘mobility.’ Where traditional transportation was a “system-centric” concept, modern mobility is completely “user-centric,” recognizing the fact that transportation must be responsive to the needs and preferences of commuters and society. Let’s find out why cities should rethink parking as ride-hailing services grows.
Ride-Hailing Services on the Rise
The new concept of shared-use mobility which lies at the centre of New Mobility Services (NMS) allows users access to various modes of transportation – bicycles, motorbikes, and cars – on a short-term and on-demand basis.
Mobility-as-a-service has emerged as a thriving concept with several push forces and enablers responsible for its popularity – one of the main push forces being a millennial aversion to car ownership. And what’s more, is that one of the main reasons the Gen-Z is against car ownership is the stress related to parking.
And the key enablers of ride-hailing services are smartphone applications and smart parking technologies such as IoT working in tandem to connect paying passengers with drivers who offer rides for a certain fee (for their private vehicles).
These ride-hailing services are easy to use and understand. Via a user-friendly smartphone application, the user simply needs to input their drop-off destination (with the pick-up destination either automatically entered through their phone’s GPS or manually entered on the map)and opt for the vehicle type (mini, micro, sedan, etc.) and the ride type (full or share) that best suits their needs and budget and book their ride.
Since these ride-hailing services recommend vehicles that are lurking nearby the pick-up location, the driver generally arrives within minutes of the booking. All that is now left to do is enjoy the ride and make the payment on arrival. How hassle-free is that!
How Cities are Coping with the Revenue Loss
Ever since the concept of mobility-as-a-service has emerged, there has been a bi-directional relationship between it and parking. And why not! After all, one of the top reasons cited for favouring ride-hailing services over car ownership is the increasing stress, hassle, and time and money loss involved in finding a vacant parking spot.
Ride-hailing does alter the parking demand. No longer is parking viewed as a necessary evil, with the degree of its necessity constantly decreasing. With ride-hailing services, people can easily access destinations of their choice without requiring an accompanying parking space. As a result, the demand for parking spaces is seeing a fall. This, in turn, has naturally led to revenue loss for the parking industry.
Cities are compelled to reduce the supply of parking spots and to look for alternative ways of allocating existing, unused parking infrastructure towards other needs and land uses. The diminished value and use of parking infrastructure offer the opportunity to put them to more in-demand and purposeful uses – parks, plazas, and similar elements – that make a city more lively and habitable.
Moreover, the low demand for parking spots owing to lesser driving trips and declining car ownership has proven to be insightful, allowing cities to rethink and better manage curb space – allocating more space for walking and bicycling, and most importantly, monetizing car trips (both private vehicles and ride-sharing vehicles) to cover up the losses incurred. For example – several airports have started charging ride-hailing vehicles a pick-up and drop-off fee for the curb space allotted to them.
Even the rise in mobility services such as ride-hailing can have their downsides – cab-sharing drivers wandering around with no passengers (dead-heading), unnecessary traffic congestions, and decline of sustainable travel options such as walking and bicycling. However, the root of the issue lies in the misuse of spaces – no proper space seems to be available for walking and bicycling.
Hence, the need of the hour is to make cities livable on a human scale with increased space for more sustainable transportation options and to allow technology to adapt to it – a truth more and more cities are waking up to.

 Autonomous tech could lead to deaths at the hands of robots. But is continuing to let humans drive even worse? 
By Rani Molla
LaBystLast year saw a jump in the number of car fatalities, even as the pandemic kept many Americans off the roads. The number of deaths per 100 million miles driven grew 24 percent from a year earlier. It was the biggest single-year rise on record — and 2021 is on track to be just as bad. At the same time, the promise of autonomous cars has never been closer. Waymo and Tesla are continually improving their autonomous capabilities, drawing the tantalizing prospect of markedly less human suffering ever nearer. But getting to that future is complicated.
The decision to switch to autonomous vehicles presents a very modern take on an old ethical dilemma: the famed trolley problem.
This thought experiment involves a trolley car driver on a collision course with a group of pedestrians. The driver can do nothing and kill several people on the track ahead or take action, switching tracks so that just one person dies. These days, doing nothing means that about 1.3 million people will die each year globally in regular car accidents, the leading cause of death in people under 30. Switching tracks would involve more rapidly developing and adopting autonomous vehicles that could eventually prevent thousands of deaths per day. The problem is that the technology has a long way to go before it can drive people safely on its own in everyday conditions. In the meantime, it could lead to deaths at the hands of robots, if not humans.
Waymo and Tesla are at the forefront of the driverless car push and thus have a front seat to this dilemma. Both have similar goals — to safely transport people in autonomous vehicles — but they are operating with wildly different strategies.
Waymo, which shares a parent company with Google, is slowly and methodically rolling out its autonomous vehicles in the form of a robo-taxi service. The company boasts it has logged well over 20 million miles of autonomous driving without a single death. But currently, regular people can only ride in one of several hundred Waymo vehicles, in sunny Phoenix. Last week, the company got permission to launch its taxi service (with a human monitor behind the wheel) in a second city — San Francisco — where hills, weather, and traffic complicate the task. The company eventually plans to launch in other cities and license its automated driver technology to car manufacturers. But Waymo doesn’t know when that will happen because, as its co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana told Kara Swisher at the September 2021 Code Conference, the company is “in the process of learning.”
“It’s, I would say, the engineering challenge of our generation. That’s what’s taking it so long,” Mawakana said. “Safety takes time.”
In the meantime, people will continue to die in car accidents, with 94 percent of fatal car crashes caused by human error.
Tesla, on the other hand, has rolled out autonomous features much more quickly. In September, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that drivers with a record of safe driving and who paid for the feature could request permission to beta test its “Full Self-Driving” technology. It includes more advanced driver assistance featuresthan Autopilot, Tesla’s existing semi-autonomous feature, which helps drivers steer, brake, and accelerate within a lane.The company claims that the hardware — but not the software, which is still being tested — in new Teslas is capable of “full self-driving in almost all circumstances” and is “designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat.” According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there are currently no fully automated or self-driving cars for sale, and such technology is years away.
The head of the National Transportation Safety Board has said that Tesla should fix existing safety deficiencies before rolling out the new tech. Meanwhile, other Tesla critics say that names like “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving” cause people to place more faith in the technology than they should, erroneously taking their hands off the wheel or not paying attention.
This dissonance has resulted in tragedy. In August, the NHTSA opened a formal investigation into Autopilot after crashes involving Teslas and emergency vehicles (12 so far). The agency has also opened special investigations into accidents suspected to have happened while advanced driver assistance systems were engaged and which have resulted in 12 deaths.
Musk maintains that, despite the deaths, these cars are 10 times safer than regular cars.
“Even if you, for argument’s sake, reduce fatalities by 90 percent with autonomy, the 10 percent that do die with autonomy are still gonna sue you,” Musk told Swisher at Code. “The 90 percent that are living don’t even know that that’s the reason they’re alive.”
There’s some truth to that. By taking humans out of the equation, autonomous cars have the potential to save lives and alleviate incalculable social and economic losses. As NHTSA put it, “Fully automated vehicles that can see more and act faster than human drivers could greatly reduce errors, the resulting crashes, and their toll.”
The key is getting to that future quickly without jeopardizing it by causing the very harm you’re attempting to stop.
Two roads traveled
If the goal is to get autonomous driving assistance to the masses, Tesla is closer. If the goal is to have cars that safely drive themselves, Waymo is winning.
“Tesla is doing high-altitude flights or near-space flights, and Waymo is landing on the moon,” Mike Ramsey, vice president at research firm Gartner, told Recode. “One is trying to achieve something that’s far harder to do than the other. But that’s not to say that the high-altitude flights can’t keep getting higher and higher.”
In other words, while Tesla probably won’t be delivering a fully autonomous vehicle anytime soon — despite its misleading naming — it could incrementally get better and better assistance features that would eventually lead to true self-driving capabilities.
Tesla vehicles are considered to be at level 2 on the engineering society SAE International’s automation scale. That means Tesla’s system requiresconstant driver supervision, even if the assistance features are handling some of the steering and braking. Waymo vehicles are level 4, meaning the car can drive itself under limited geographic conditions and doesn’t need driver supervision. However, the technology that powers them is not ready for mass-market use outside of its test areas.
Waymo’s hardware is much more robust than Tesla’s. It uses several redundant sensor systems, including lidar, radar, and cameras, to create a real-time picture of where it’s operating. The company also maps areas ahead of time by having human drivers manually drive the vehicles through them. Meanwhile, Tesla vehicles rely exclusively on cameras and ultrasonic sensors.
“The more sensors you have, it adds to the complexity of the system, but it also makes it way safer,” Ramsey said.
Cameras aren’t as accurate at gauging distance as lidar or radar, andtheir ability to map an area can be impaired by everyday hazards like snow, dust, or darkness. However, cameras are a lot cheaper, and that matters when it comes to getting this technology into consumers’ hands.
You can purchase a souped-up Model 3 Tesla for around $75,000. However, experts don’t think Tesla vehicles could be fully autonomous with their current hardware, and will likely need to incorporate other technology like lidar to get there. We don’t know the exact price of Waymo vehicles — which are Chrysler Pacificas and Jaguar I-Paces outfitted with Waymo’s sensors and autonomous driver tech — but the company’s former CEO previously said it “cost no more than a moderately equipped Mercedes S-Class,” which has a price tag of about $180,000. Waymo says its costs have come down significantly with the latest generation.
But by selling its vehicles to the general public, Tesla is able to collect lots of real-world driving data that will be useful in helping solve autonomous driving challenges. Raj Rajkumar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and an autonomous vehicle pioneer, calls Tesla’s data collection an “incredible advantage” but warns that data is “part of the answer, but it’s not the entire answer.” Still, he thinks Waymo ought to collect more of it from regular drivers in regular conditions.
“We should be driving them whenever they can drive themselves and, when they do not, humans drive themselves,” Rajkumar said. “And for a time we collect experience. We understand what works, what does not work, and we refine.”
Tesla’s relatively wide reach also means rolling out a truly autonomous vehicle, when they eventually make one, will be a lot easier.
“Tesla’s strategy is interesting because, if it works, it could be a lot more scalable. They could launch a lot faster in other cities than their competitors could,” Tasha Keeney, an analyst at Ark Invest, which has a large stake in Tesla, said. Keeney said a faster rollout of autonomous vehicles will hasten a safer driving future, but it won’t be without cost.
“Are computers better than humans at driving? I think yes,” she said. “Will there be mistakes along the way? Yes.”
What’s next for autonomous vehicles?
Experts estimate that we could have level 3 or 4 cars for sale within the next 10 years. But in the meantime, it’s important not to overlook the benefits that the pursuit of autonomous cars has already wrought. Cars will soon be able to reliably take over in some instances, say, on the highway — where the lanes are clearly marked and the rules are pretty clear — but humans might take over on city streets.
Already a number of advanced driver assistance features are showing up on regular vehicles. Automatic emergency braking, technology that automatically slows or stops the car before it hits an object, has been shown to reduce injuries and fatalities and will be standard on most vehicles sold in the US next year. Consumers can expect more of these features to spill over from the quest for autonomous vehicles in the next few years.
“We should all stop thinking in terms of something magical will happen and all of a sudden cars will become self-driving,” Rajkumar said. Rather, the shift will happen feature by feature, after many tests and improvements. “That last change will be so incremental you won’t be able to realize it happened over the last five to 10 years.”
When cars do become fully autonomous, there are also benefits beyond safe driving. Keeney said autonomous technology would also greatly reduce the cost of travel because of cars’ increased utilization as taxis, without the expense of a driver. “It’ll give a lot of people access to very inexpensive point-to-point travel, which could totally change our lives and how we get around.”
In the meantime, perhaps the path forward for self-driving cars isn’t a binary choice at all. We’ll likely see a spectrum of improvements from many car companies as they incorporate more and more driver assistance features. And although in the near term the tech might not be the self-driving future we were promised, it will be better than nothing.
“We should not lose sight of the benefits the technology can bring,” Rajkumar said. “It takes time, but we’ll eventually get there.”

Every service has a last mile – that final, physical meeting between consumer and provider. We tend to equate the “last-mile” concept with retail, with the delivery vans that move from distribution center to doorstep.
But healthcare has its last mile – and its last-mile frictions, too. That can mean scheduling the appointments, getting in the car, making one’s way to the doctor or provider – oftentimes dedicating a huge swath of the day to the task.
It’s no secret that the pandemic has forced us all to go online for daily interactions, and that telehealth has been widely adopted. But much of healthcare – such as the preventive efforts that can catch illnesses before they become life-threatening – is tangible, requiring needles, vials, labs and technicians.
We tend to skip appointments for the needed checkups, the blood draws and the other diagnostic tests that are so essential to treatment.
There’s a way to solve the last-mile gap here, as Sprinter Health co-founders Cameron Behar (CTO) and Max Cohen (CEO) told Karen Webster: Bring lab services and testing into the home environment – on demand.
“A lot can be done to solve the problem of access in healthcare,” said Cohen, who posited some key questions about access: “How can we try and get these critical diagnostics, especially these new generations of tests, to patients in a way that’s affordable, accessible, flexible – driving a great patient experience?”
To that end, Sprinter Health announced earlier this month that it has come out of stealth mode with a $33 million investment via Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from General Catalyst, Accel, Google Ventures (GV) and other leading investors.
At a high level, the company said, Sprinter Health addresses the last mile in healthcare by making access to a range of tests and vitals checks as simple as ordering food to be delivered to the home.
In terms of the mechanics, “sprinters” – defined by Cohen and Behar as “tech-savvy phlebotomists” – conduct a range of at-home lab work services at a patient’s home, spanning blood draws, vitals checks, urine sample collection or COVID-19 checks.
The duo said that its technology uses real-time messaging to keep patients apprised about sprinters’ progress. They utilize a “checklist,” said Behar, to complete as services are performed.
Cohen and Behar, with stints at Google and Facebook, come from technology backgrounds, and both had fathers who were doctors. And Cohen, with a long history of suffering from an undiagnosed herniated disk, had firsthand experience with the problems that untreated conditions can cause.
“There’s some amazing technology coming out, but the problem is that it’s not getting in the hands of providers fast enough,” said Cohen. Or providers may have technology in hand, but patients lack access. Individuals may be homebound, or working parents may be unable to schedule time to get to the lab and have blood taken.
That’s a problem in a world where 70% of medical decisions start with a diagnosis, which in turn starts with a lab test. To get a sense of how the tech-enabled, on-demand model can solve for some of the frictions in the last mile of healthcare, Cohen pointed to pre-chemotherapy lab draws.
Cancer patients who travel for treatment have to visit the provider after having blood drawn the day before the treatment. They may be sent home before getting chemo if their white blood cell counts are not satisfactory, he said. But with in-home testing, said Cohen, “you get a text message that we’re on the way, you get a picture of who’s going to be showing up. We come in, and we’re in and out of the house. In under six minutes, we can get that test out” to be examined and confirmed by a physician that same day – paving the way for a timely chemotherapy session.
As Behar and Cohen explained, Sprinter Health can be viewed as an infrastructure play into the healthcare system, serving as connective tissue between patients and providers – at $79 a visit, which is cost-effective compared to in-office visits.
“We’re interested in creating something that helps both the health system to fill that chair, and the patient who doesn’t have to come in and miss work all day for something that ends up not even happening,” Cohen told Webster.
Getting to Scale
The company, which had a $4.6 million funding round in place before the Series A, has been teaming with specialty labs and remains in the early stages of partnering with several health systems as well, forging both a direct-to-consumer and partner-based ecosystem.
Looking ahead, the firm will expand geographically beyond California into Texas, Florida and other states. As the company scales, the duo said, it will look for a subset of the phlebotomist population that is comfortable with technology, with an eye on the fact that certification (to conduct the tests) can vary from state to state. A further goal is to have clusters of patients within cities and towns, which makes the sprinters’ journeys most cost-effective. Eventual payment models will include patient payments (the current model), co-pay and partner pay, said Cohen.
As Behar pointed out, though there has been tremendous growth in the telehealth space, “we know that they’re fundamentally going to be limited by the number of services they can offer with actual hands in the home. We’re hoping to be those kinds of clinical extenders for services like theirs – so they can actually help diagnose an ear infection by looking in your ear. They can actually look in your eyes and get those necessary diagnostics beyond blood draws.”

The VoloDrone in actionVolocopterVIEW 3 IMAGES
Better known for its work developing audacious 18-rotor flying taxis to solve congestion in city centers, Volocopter is adapting its expertise in electric aviation for the purposes of moving heavy cargo. Its giant VoloDrone has now completed its very first public flight, demonstrating how it can safely transport large loads with the help of cargo bikes and play a key role in an all-electric multi-mode delivery system.
Since introducing the VoloDrone in 2019, Volocopter has carried out regular test flights in closed airfields around Germany. Like the Volocopter itself, the giant drone uses 18 rotors, a battery and electric motors to hoist itself into the air, using a rail attachment system in between its landing gear to carry payloads of up to 200 kg (440 lb) over a 40-km (24-mile) range.
On Tuesday, the VoloDrone carried out its first simulated delivery in the public arena, with the exercise undertaken together with logistics firm DB Schenker. This took place as part of ITS World Congress 2021 in Hamburg, and began with the team securing a load to the VoloDrone’s undercarriage.
The aircraft then took off, reaching an altitude of 22 m (72 ft) and carrying the load over a three-minute flight to a nearby carpark, where it came down to land safely. From there, electric cargo bikes were used to transfer the load to its destination beneath a nearby decking.
“This first public VoloDrone flight is a strong sign for Volocopter´s leading position in the UAM (urban air mobility) industry,” says Florian Reuter, CEO of Volocopter. “We are the only UAM company offering solutions for passengers and goods that are flying fully scaled and publicly around the world. Our VoloDrone will make existing logistics processes more robust, efficient, and sustainable. DB Schenker is an invaluable partner in our endeavor to untap the massive potential of our VoloDrone’s logistics use cases.”
As it continues carrying out test flights of the VoloDrone along with its passenger aircraft, Volocopter is working on the infrastructure side of things to support the operations of these vehicles. These could take the shape of so-called VoloPort networks where the vehicles can land, swap batteries and pick up people and cargo. The company says today it is planning to launch these sometime in the next two or three years, though there’ll be regulations and a certification process for it to navigate before a proper lift-off.

A smart city has billions of connected devices and systems. This includes smart street lighting, pedestrian management, road management, waste management, air/noise quality monitoring, smart medical systems etc. Enormous volumes of data will be generated for security, productivity and the quality of life of the citizens. A unified data management framework is imperative for the smooth functioning of a smart city. However, storing and processing such massive amounts of data via the internet will put tremendous pressure on networks and make a dent in the city’s funds. The best solution to this would be to store data locally for easy and immediate access. This is usually done with edge computing.
Understanding Edge Computing
Unlike the standard internet model that relies heavily upon cloud technology services provided by Google, Microsoft, etc., edge computing is a complementary model where the processing of information and its storage is done at the very edge of the network. This means that the information under edge computing is stored as close as possible to the end-points of a network and the devices it is servicing.
This method of processing and storage of data lets organizations render services even when there is no internet connectivity and enabling localized data processing.
Since edge computing makes it possible to develop applications without an internet connection, the installed multiple edge servers will form a network, enabling apps and services to run locally at the edge as opposed to it running on a central cloud platform. As a result, autonomous operations can be performed even when backhaul coverage is lost and lower latency will be required since applications are located nearer to the data source. An open platform will be freely available for third-party developers to develop new applications.
The Need for Edge Computing for Smarter Cities
Smart city development pilots and projects have been replaced with more wide-scale deployments. The concept of a smart city has the IoT (Internet of Things) as a foundation – a network of connected devices offering easy and real-time data exchange for the efficient management of services.
Common examples of IoT deployment include tracking of buses, traffic light and signage management, control of street lighting, refuse monitoring, air quality control, etc.
There are several operational benefits to such deployments. However, too many applications lead to the formation of a large number of data streams, generating the risk of network overloading issues. If these data streams are forced to remain in connection with cloud-based data centres.
The wireless network on which the connectivity of the data sensors depends upon – 5G – is still in a precarious state, even in developed countries. 5G may be the panacea to all network infrastructural problems, but there are only a few widespread commercial deployments of it as of now. There are few proper use cases that justify its costs.
The technology of edge computing can lead not only to operational cost savings but also to an unlimited range of smart apps that can be managed through a single platform, as opposed to siloing it across management devices.
Edge Computing in Everyday Life
Here’s how edge computing technology can improve things in our daily lives:
Street Lights
Smart street lights are growing in popularity, as a result of which there is a rising demand for networking, computing, and storage resources. What smart streetlights need is a highly scalable system that can facilitate easy migration, fast deployment, and high resource utilization. Many cities are replacing their sodium street lights with LED-powered ones. Edge computing provides lighting controls and a means for deploying a universal platform on which other smart apps can also be developed.
Security CCTV Cameras
Today’s smart cameras can be made ‘conscious’ using edge computing to recognize objects and faces. Low-cost and straightforward wireless IP cameras on the market today from which footage can be stored locally in edge for easy and immediate access. This would help save on backhaul costs.
Connected Parking Meters
Edge computing is also being used to deploy smart parking meters, where such systems can be monitored on demand. The data will be transmitted to a central database only in case of a fault, for easy local access.
High-Bandwidth Messaging Services
Edge computing can help provide a high-bandwidth messaging platform that can run without a connection to the internet on standard smartphones and tablets. City workers can use this high-resilient local area network for quick exchange of information.
While smart cities pose a challenge with the vast volumes of data that they will generate and the billions of smart devices that will need to stay connected to each other at all times. Thankfully, edge computing can effectively deal with these problems by offering smooth operation without internet connectivity, enhancing security as the processes are limited to the “edge,” lowering operating costs, and reducing risk with compliances.

If you are looking to expand your sales territory and have not yet put Latin America on your bill of lading, you’re missing a golden opportunity. Latin America offers the fastest-growing regional e-commerce marketplace in the world.
You do not think so? Well, think again. Last year, the total retail e-commerce sales to the LATAM region grew 36.7 percent to $84.95 billion. That is still growing this year.
Among the larger individual economies in the region, Argentina was the fastest growing, with a retail e-commerce increase rate of 79 percent. Brazil’s e-commerce growth rate was 35 percent, while Mexico’s was 27 percent.
“Normally, our holiday rush begins in November. Last year it started in July, and basically never ended,” said A.J. Hernandez, president and CEO of international business-to-consumer shipping firm SkyPostal.
The pandemic increased shipping volumes to Christmas levels in July all over the world as well as throughout Latin America. With the approach of summer, Hernandez sees a continued growth trend as the region works to vaccinate the population.
“I do not believe that there will be a leveling off now that people are more comfortable with online shopping,” he predicted.
Marketing Basics
Hernandez, whose firm is widely recognized as the industry leader in Latin American shipping and delivery logistics, noted that Latin America is, in addition to being a rapidly growing e-commerce market, one of the world’s most complex economic regions.
South America consists of 33 individual countries and an additional 15 dependencies and territories. Populations range in size, with Brazil the largest at 212.6 million people. The Falkland Islands comprise the smallest with just less than 3,500 people.
Most of these countries support their own currencies and have their own taxation and customs authorities. They have their own postal systems, too. But they are widely regarded as unreliable. So you will have to be a bit creative in handling the last mile of delivery.
“U.S.-based companies have to understand the local flavor. The last-mile delivery is key to success. This means partnering with local delivery service providers as well as hiring local leaders,” Ray Wang, a principal analyst at Constellation Research, told the E-Commerce Times.
Latin America has seen the acceleration of digital all across the board. The e-commerce market has seen five years of accelerated transformation in one year, Wang offered about the existing potential for sales growth.
“In Latin America, we have seen innovations in last-mile delivery services, more use of buy online pick up at the curb, and even improvements in payments and apps,” he added.
E-Commerce Market Maker
The pandemic introduced many people to online shopping as it became a necessity. Prior to the pandemic, adoption was not as high in the region as it was in the U.S., Canada, Asia, and Europe, according to Hernandez.
But the pandemic changed the e-commerce landscape considerably in Latin America. The market growth elsewhere as a percentage was not as impressive, since those regions already had higher adoption rates. Yet their volume increases were just as high.
Product offerings are ripe for the picking among Latin American consumers. Many categories of products are globally sought after. Then there are “niche” or hard-to-get items that are not as easy to get as in other markets, Hernandez noted.
That makes an opening that U.S.-based vendors should take. Successful marketers do not need to overdo e-commerce technology. Rather, they should utilize tech to better facilitate the logistical challenges.
For instance, U.S.-based vendors should identify products that are not readily available in the local markets or are very costly. They find a way to make these products available for shoppers supported by a strong logistics network to manage the deliveries, suggested Hernandez.
“Fifty-two million people in that region are expected to make their first online purchase during the pandemic, which could create an increase of up to 30 percent in online consumers in some Latin American countries,” said Hernandez.
What’s more, the Latin American market is expected to grow more than eight percent and reach a market value of $200 billion, he added.
Overcoming Obstacles
U.S.-based marketers and vendors need to be proactive to enter this marketplace. Obstacles do exist but are not insurmountable.
For instance, the number of consumers venturing online to shop lack physical bank accounts. That is a key challenge, remarked Constellation Research’s Wang.
“One opportunity is to leverage the mobile operators who can extend credit on the phone bill or improve sign up of microcredit services,” he offered.
Past issues involving e-commerce for consumers in the Latin America region have long existed, added Hernandez. But a shift in consumer attitudes in starting to improve the damaged online trust factor.
Build Trust or No Sale
Before the pandemic, Latin American consumers fell on the wrong side of the trust barrier. Many feared putting their credit card information online. That also included American citizens reticent to do business with Latin America for fear of credit card fraud.
Covid-19’s arrival shut local stores. Latin American consumers had no choice but to change their trust issues. Now, a new level of confidence is evident that will sustain the region’s growth in e-commerce even after the pandemic has lifted.
“Positive experiences with online shopping have done a lot to erode the underlying mistrust that has always been prevalent in Latin America,” Hernandez said.
Whether it was concern about having a credit card number stolen, or never receiving ordered products, those issues are less of a barrier. Now that Latin American consumers have tried it and found that it works, they trust the process, he added.
Challenges and Technology
The biggest challenge businesses face when expanding to Latin American consumers is that each country has its own set of rules. It is important that businesses work with experts who are familiar with the region to help them avoid the pitfalls that have caused other businesses to fail, recommended Hernandez.
Also, do not sell logistics short. Logistics is as much about delivering data as it is about delivering packages.
Sellers want data. They want to know where their packages are when they are delivered, and if there are any challenges.
“Online visibility is critical, as are data services, to help sellers provide critical information necessary to import goods such as tax ID numbers and HS Codes,” he explained.
In addition, the technology used to correct errors in the initial shipment data and validating postal codes is also critical to success.
Navigating the Shipping and Selling Lanes
The growth in e-commerce and logistical capabilities needed will still require merchants’ keen attentiveness in tapping into the overall Latin American retail economy. To successfully navigate that course, U.S.-based merchants use specialists in Latin American logistics to handle their shipping.
For example, SkyPostal is actually an IT company focused on package delivery. It provides its clients API-based solutions that coordinate their own checkout systems with all the necessary delivery data. The company also offers services in the U.S., Canada, and Europe through partners with similar expertise.
Rather than struggle with setting up a fine-tuned web presence for selling your wares to Latin America’s consumers, consider using an already existing online sales marketplace with built-in selling expertise.
Mercado Libre, known as the “Amazon of Latin America,” has operations in 18 countries throughout the region, is the fourth largest online marketplace in the world, and the largest in Latin America in terms of visits per month. Its top markets are Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico.
Another option for handling localized shipping is ShipStation; which has a partnership with Mercado Libre. That could be a big help to U.S.-based SMBs looking to break into selling to the Latin American marketplace with a package deal.
ShipStation offers shipping software and also has partnerships with more than 300 leading shopping cart, carriers, and fulfillment services. These include FedEx, UPS, the United States Postal Service, Amazon, Shopify, and BigCommerce.

The National Science Foundation (NSF), in partnership with the Department of Energy, has awarded a $1 million Stage 2 Civic Innovation Challenge grant to a team led by A. Russell Chandler III Chair and Professor Pascal Van Hentenryck to pilot an On-Demand Multimodal Transit System (ODMTS) in Atlanta. The goal of the project is to make public transportation in Atlanta faster, more convenient, and more equitable for the city’s residents, especially in underserved communities.
According to Van Hentenryck, who also leads the Socially Aware Mobility Lab, mass transit has a significant first- and last-mile problem: Most people will only walk a quarter of a mile to and from public transportation. If the distance exceeds this threshold, ridership decreases by more than 90%. To address this, Van Hentenryck’s team has created an ODMTS, which uses small on-demand vehicles, in addition to buses and light rail, to take riders to and from their destinations. The on-demand vehicles act as feeders to and from the fixed routes, allowing the transit system to be essentially door-to-door.
Van Hentenryck, a world leader in the fields of artificial intelligence, data science, and operations research, began to tackle the first- and last-mile problems in mobility eight years ago in Canberra, Australia. He then conducted another successful case study in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In both midsized cities, the multi-modal approach resulted in a significant reduction in both cost and passenger wait times. In 2018, Van Hentenryck joined ISyE, shifted his focus to Atlanta, and began a collaboration with the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA). This winter, after more than three years of preparation, the team plans to pilot ODMTS in Atlanta areas with limited public transportation.
While ODMTS will improve the performance and efficiency of public transportation for everyone in Atlanta, the main objective is to provide cost-effective transportation to underserved communities and connect residents in underserved communities to jobs, healthcare, education, and healthy food. The ODMTS pilot will run in MARTA’s four jurisdictions: Clayton, DeKalb, and Fulton counties, and the City of Atlanta.
“It is almost impossible to do this with a traditional system, because these areas are very large and sparsely populated,” said Van Hentenryck. “It is not feasible to put buses in these areas, because they would run empty most of the time, and they require significant capital expenditures. On-demand vehicles, however, are inexpensive to operate and can reach a larger population, because they can be deployed as needed rather than following a set route.”
Though this is not the team’s first pilot, tackling a city like Atlanta is no small feat. Most of the algorithms used in Canberra and Ann Arbor had to be completely rewritten to account for Atlanta’s size and rail system, a component not part of the previous pilots. This creates a four-level system — trains, buses, on-demand vehicles, and walking — to get passengers to and from their locations.
“Atlanta is also a complicated city because it has multiple job centers. In addition to downtown, there are centers in Midtown, Gwinnett, Alpharetta, Buckhead, and near the airport,” said Van Hentenryck. “This makes for a much more complex design since we are taking people from their homes to one of many locations for work.”
Tickets will cost the same as the traditional MARTA system, just $2.50 each way, and riders will be able to purchase fare using the Breeze system. The team is also using a combination of machine learning and optimization techniques to predict rider behavior and ensure the system can scale accordingly.
“If we decrease transit time by 40%, more people will adopt transit because now it is much faster and more convenient than it used to be,” explained Van Hentenryck. “This will increase the demand, so it is important that we size the system correctly to account for this.”
ODMTS will also help decrease traffic congestion in Atlanta and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by enabling more people to use public transportation in place of personal vehicles. The addition of on-demand vehicles will also create jobs since additional drivers will be necessary to operate them. No existing bus routes will be eliminated during the pilot.
Collaboration Leads to Success
“MARTA’s leadership is very forward thinking, and they are working to determine the future of public transportation,” said Van Hentenryck. “They have been extremely collaborative throughout the process and provided us with vast amounts of data and insights to drive the process.”
“We are grateful to the National Science Foundation for this grant and proud to partner with Georgia Tech,” said MARTA Deputy General Manager Collie Greenwood. “Exploring first- and last-mile connectivity options is important in providing transit service that meets the needs of everyone in metro Atlanta.” 
In addition to Van Hentenryck, the Georgia Tech team that will pilot ODMTS in Atlanta includes Professor Subhrajit “Subhro” Guhathakurta in the School of City and Regional Planning, Executive Director for Partnership and Inclusive Innovation Debra Lam, Associate Professor Christopher Le Dantec in the School of Interactive Computing, and Frederick Law Olmsted Associate Professor Kari Watkins in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
The research team will partner directly with residents in pilot communities, as well as with the transportation advocacy organization Atlanta Bicycle Coalition, to ensure transit services and access address the real-world needs of underserved locations.
“Our long history of working directly with Atlanta communities, and with local partners like the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition, will help us embed local expertise into the design of last-mile transit service for under-served locations in the city,” said Le Dantec.
The Stage 2 Civic Innovation Challenge grant is the latest in a series of awards to bring ODMTS to Atlanta. The team received the NSF Leap HI (Leading Engineering for America’s Prosperity, Health, and Infrastructure) grant in 2019 in collaboration with the School of Civil Engineering, School of Urban Planning, MARTA, the Atlanta Regional Commission, and the City of Atlanta to scale the algorithms used in Canberra and Ann Arbor with hopes to eventually pilot the program in Atlanta. They were then awarded a Stage 1 Civic Innovation Challenge planning grant in January 2021 to model the mobility patterns in Atlanta in preparation for a pilot in Stage 2.
“Professor Van Hentenryck deserves much credit for having the foresight to bring multidisciplinary, applied research and external partners together to catalyze innovative responses to regional and urban mobility,” Lam said. “We are excited to explore how this can be modeled for other communities for greater economic and social growth.”
Of the 52 teams selected for Stage 1, only 17 were chosen to move forward with pilot projects in Stage 2. They will have 12 months to complete and evaluate their projects.
“We applaud the efforts of all the teams who worked tirelessly to build partnerships between researchers and community stakeholders” said NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. “We are excited to see the teams selected for the next phase begin their pilot projects and plant seeds of innovation across the country. This program demonstrates the value of research-community partnerships in rapidly translating cutting-edge science into community-based innovation, and we look forward to seeing its positive impact across urban and rural communities.”
Van Hentenryck is eager to implement the pilot. “For me, this is the most successful research that you can have,” he said. “We started more than three years ago with an idea and now we get to make a difference in the lives of people.”

The trusty delivery van may be the most common form of last mile delivery in cities around the world, but its position atop the throne is now being challenged by an unlikely competitor: the humble electric cargo bicycle.
Cargo e-bikes are similar to most electric bicycles in that they feature an assist motor and battery to help the rider travel faster and farther. But unlike most electric bicycles, cargo e-bikes have longer, more robust frames designed to carry significantly larger loads and sometimes even additional passengers.
A new study has found that in urban areas, electric cargo bicycles make deliveries 60% faster than delivery vans.
While delivery vans may be capable of carrying more packages, they are much less efficient at actually making deliveries.
The study found that electric cargo bikes were capable of making 10 deliveries per hour on average in urban areas, while delivery vans recorded just 6 deliveries in the same period.
The major factor was the increased average speed of delivery e-bikes. They were able to utilize bicycle lanes and thus avoid getting bogged down in traffic. Larger delivery vans don’t have the same luxury, ultimately spending much more time waiting in traffic.
The study also found that cargo electric bicycles didn’t just get deliveries done faster, they also performed the job much more cleanly.
Compared to diesel vans, the cargo e-bikes cut emissions by 90%. Even compared to electric vans, cargo e-bikes had 30% fewer emissions.
While electric delivery vans are slowly becoming more commonplace, they still can’t compete with cargo e-bikes on efficiency or emissions.
They’re a huge improvement over fossil fuel-powered vans, but they use more energy to make deliveries and they get bogged down in traffic just the same.
The speed and efficiency advantages of electric cargo bikes have been exploited by a number of industries.
E-bike maker Tern recently teamed up with Dutch-X to combine the latter’s NYC delivery service with the former’s heavy duty electric cargo bikes.
Third party logistics companies such as UPS, FedEx and DHL have employed cargo e-bikes to increase the speed and efficiency of package deliveries in urban areas.
Hospitals have used cargo e-bikes as mini-ambulances to more quickly deliver EMTs and their life-saving first aid to emergency sites.
And cargo e-bikes are even being used by entrepreneurs to operate food trucks and ice-cream vans on smaller, cheaper and more sustainable platforms.
Electrek’s Take
I file this one in the ‘duh’ category.
Cargo e-bikes simply make so much sense. I’ve always had a thing for e-bikes that can carry more than one person, and cargo e-bikes combine that shared fun factor with extreme utility for carrying cargo/groceries/supplies/deliveries/etc.
They have the ability to replace so many types of vehicles.
Think you need a minivan to move apartments? I’ve done it on a cargo e-bike.
Think you need a truck to make a lumber run to your local home improvement store? I’ve done it on a cargo e-bike.
Think you need an SUV to haul all the kids to school? I’ve done it on a cargo e-bike.
Think you need a van to pick up a new bike? Mikey’s done it on a cargo e-bike.
There’s just so much utility to be had with a cargo electric bike. What’s not to like?!

Transportation systems traditionally favour suburban, upwardly mobile users over those from lower-income groups and neighbourhoods.Emerging technology – AI in particular – can help to address this issue.Safe, equitable transportation is within our reach, but we still have a lot of work to do.
Amidst our current reckoning with structural racism, gender bias and unequal access to education and economic opportunity, the transportation industry has a responsibility to acknowledge its own contributions to these inequities. We also have an opportunity to begin to address them – through more considered choices going forward, and, excitingly, with the help of new technology. If these solutions also enhance safety and lower risk for all road users, and if they produce fewer emissions while using our planet’s resources more efficiently, we as a society will have achieved a rare triple-win.
New transit models will democratize safe transportation moving forward. Historically, transit design – and the interstate system in particular – has catered to suburban, upwardly mobile groups, while exacerbating the socioeconomic divide and limiting access to opportunity for those most in need. A recent Harvard studydemonstrated that transportation is the single largest determinant of social mobility. Lack of access can lead to less opportunity, more dependence on (often subpar) public transportation, and longer commute times. Ideally, transit networks should open up a city to all those who live within its proximity, not create mobility and economic hurdles.
Although the link between social mobility and access to transportation is troubling, even more so is how disproportionately low-income communities experience the effects of traffic-related fatalities; for example, those walking in lower-income metropolitan areas have twice the fatality rates of those walking in other neighbourhoods. Transit design in low-income communities is often not optimized for safety to the same extent as in more affluent communities. For instance, low-income communities often lack safe sidewalks and biking infrastructure, while also suffering from higher traffic volumes and higher-speed roadways. This safety disparity costs lives and is one of the most critical problems the transportation industry needs to address: bringing safe mobility to everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status.
Have you read?
When I began exploring autonomous vehicles more than a decade ago as a graduate student at Stanford University, I was excited about the challenges involved. Robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, cars, behavioural economics, psychology and more, all combined into two deep questions: first, how can we solve this incredibly complex technical problem; and second, how can we rethink transportation in cities if people don’t have to drive their own cars?
As I learned more about the needs of people in cities, another topic surfaced, too: the extent of the discrepancy in people’s ability to get from point A to point B. In aggregate, taxi drivers (of all races) preferentially pick up white passengers. Residents of underserved communities often have to spend hours commuting on multiple bus routes or biking along streets with cars zipping by at more than 40 miles per hour. Sometimes there are no sidewalks.
These hurdles make people’s lives harder. Through this lens, developing autonomous vehicles is even more than an exciting technical, economic, safety and environmental challenge; it’s a people issue, too. How can we find ways for everyone – regardless of their socioeconomic status or where they live in a city – to safely and efficiently go where they want?

Often when confronted with massive societal-level problems like these, we turn to the government for answers or solutions. No doubt, they have a critical role to play in almost all pieces of the puzzle. But changing laws, societal norms, and decades-old programmes can take a long time at best, and sometimes there are so many stakeholders, different opinions, and inability (or unwillingness) to pay, that genuine change feels out of reach. So it’s exciting when new technologies and associated business models emerge that can play a part in solving the hardest problems.
AI comes with its own challenges – but it absolutely can and will play a role in bringing safe, clean, and affordable transportation models to our roadways. Most public transit systems require significant capital investments in infrastructure and are typically designed to accommodate the greatest need (which, itself, is subject to opinion and bias). The challenge, then, is that services like trains and bus lines are restricted to just the number of stops and areas they can serve. As a city grows and evolves, the public transit systems often remain the same – becoming inaccessible to those who rely on it the most.
Amidst the rigidity of public transportation, we have the so-called last-mile problem: a situation where travelers are often not able to reach their exact destination, but are able to get within a few miles or so. Taxis, ridehailing, scooters, biking and walking are all possible solutions, but there can be financial, safety, or practical barriers associated with these. Many individuals purchase a car specifically to avoid public transportation, or don’t have access to it in the first place.

Demand for mobility-as-a-service has grown steadily over the past decade, especially in cities. This model brings many benefits, and at its best, can be genuinely complimentary to public transportation – but it has also left some people behind. Traditional ridehailing services can be unpredictable, especially with surge pricing and the recent shortage of drivers.
While modern-day ridehailing services have partially democratized the personal chauffeur, there are overhead costs that are passed on to the riders: for example, the expenses to pay drivers a living wage or the cost to cover deadheading (the term for when a vehicle is underutilized and drives around without charging for its miles). And while most drivers are safe and courteous with clean and well-maintained vehicles, unfortunately, that’s not always the case.MOBILITY
What is the World Economic Forum doing about mobility?
Show
With new technologies, we can build a more affordable and inclusive transportation system for even more of our communities. Our vehicles will be meaningfully safer than their human-driven counterparts. Over time, they will cost much less to use. They’ll create less pollution and use fewer resources, because they’re utilized all day and night long. Within their geofence, they won’t discriminate based on race or socioeconomic status. They’ll be reliably clean and well maintained. And they’ll be a pleasure to ride in, having been designed for exactly that.
The potential societal benefits are tremendous, but we still have a long and capital-intensive road ahead. Along this journey, there will be challenges; we certainly won’t solve everything for everyone right away. But we couldn’t be more excited to help address some of society’s oldest issues by dismantling historic transportation hurdles and bringing safe, clean and enjoyable transportation to everyone.

The American public transit system seems to be in shambles. Citizens have steadily abandoned public transport in favour of private vehicles. An ongoing debate about the state of public transport cites numerous factors, including lack of funds. However, it is not just the government that is to be blamed for the decline in the usage of public transport.
The State of the American Public Transit System
Several means of public transport exist in US cities like Washington DC, New York City, Boston, Seattle Chicago, and San Francisco. While cities like Houston has an excellent public transport system,  many places suffer from traffic congestion problems because there are no mass transit solutions.
Since 2012, public transport ridership has increased in New York but has declined in many other cities. The major reason is that mass transit systems are plagued with safety and operational problems. Passengers getting held up because of trains breaking down is no longer something out of the ordinary.  Moreover, places like the New York subway stations have noticed an increase in passenger violence and theft.
To understand the declining state of the American public transit system, one needs to look into how public transport systems were maintained by the government in the past.
At the turn of the 20th century, once private automobiles became popular, instead of improving services to stay competitive, the U.S transit agency downgraded service to cut costs.
This neglect drove away many riders, creating a notion that public transport is a welfare system for those who cannot afford to drive. This notion created a vicious cycle where only those who couldn’t afford private vehicles used public transport and the government offered minimal funds for maintenance.
The downside to viewing public transport as a welfare system is that it prevents the system from charging a fee high enough to provide efficient service. Moreover, American citizens prioritize trains and buses with higher reach over frequency. They want the American public transit system to cater to every block, instead of fewer trains which arrive frequently.
However, those who understand public transport agree that it is better to have fewer lines with frequent trains instead of many trains which leave once every few hours.
What Other Cities Got Right About Public Transit
Canada is geographically spread out just like the US but still manages to have a well-functioning public transport system in its major cities. This is because Canadian policymakers believe in having a transport system which focuses on frequency rather than reach and invest funds accordingly.
The fundamental difference between the transit in European and American cities is the infrastructure of the transport. Post the Second World War, automobiles became a symbol of reconstruction. Europe developed elaborate plans to diminish historic neighbourhoods to make way for wider roads and parking spaces.
The US did the same, but the difference was that European suburbs were designed in a way that made transit use viable whereas the early US suburbs like New York were built along highways and had an underdeveloped transit service.
The primary idea differentiating transit systems in the US from other countries in the developed world is the amount of importance and attention given to public transportation. If viewed as a welfare system, public transport will continue to be deprived of adequate funds for maintenance.
Public transport reduces carbon gas emissions and consumption of fuel, making it great for the environment. With a burgeoning population, public transport also tackles the problem of limited parking spaces.
Being the largest economy in the world, the US will have to invest in improving the public transport system for its citizens.

Bike share equity remains an uphill battle in impoverished neighborhoods and communities populated primarily by low-income residents and people of color. However, neither catering to affluent, white men nor community apathy and indifference are necessarily to blame. The reasons are complicated, but progress is happening, and more inroads are on the horizon.
Bike sharing is a communal transportation service in which bikes are made available for short-term use. Typically, the bikes are picked up at one location and returned to another. The average fee, according to ScienceDirect, can be about $4.29 for a two-hour trip, but fees vary depending on the operator, the amount of use time, and the city. A two-hour ride in Washington D.C., for example, may cost $10 or more, according to Moneycrashers.
A movement is born
The fluctuating costs, variables like late turn-in fees, and the tendency for bike share systems to be located in more affluent communities or near tourist attractions, has pegged these services as a recreational amenity for the privileged. There is now an intentional movement to diversify and reframe bike share programs as a public transit service for everyone.
“It is important to be able to access essential services — to travel to a grocery store, a COVID vaccination site, school, or work. If you don’t have transportation, if you don’t have access to a reliable bus system or a car because you cannot afford it, you’re limited in your work, school or life options,” says Kiran Herbert, local program writer and content manager for PeopleforBikes, and a founding partner of Better Bike Share Partnership (BBSP).
BBSP is a collaboration that funds bike-equity initiatives in low-income and BIPOC communities. Since 2015, BBSP has funded 76 grants, totaling over $1.5 million, according to Herbert.
“Bike shares allow for mobility and freedom to participate in our society, and live a life you choose,” she continued.
Herbert was referring to making bike share systems accessible in all neighborhoods, particularly those areas where bike-share options can enhance or fill in public transit gaps. However, bike share equity exceeds operators actively placing bike share systems in underserved neighborhoods; access also includes affordability
The Detroit Solution
In Detroit, the MoGo Bike Share System offers a discounted access pass for low-income riders. The access pass is an annual membership that allows riders year-long, daily bike usage. The cost for people who receive some type of childcare or public assistance is $5 for the entire year. The usual fee is $95.
“We really didn’t want the price for bike share to be a barrier for anyone who needed transportation or even just to run errands, especially in a city like Detroit where so many people don’t have access to cars or maybe cannot afford other forms of transportation,” said Adriel Thornton, MoGo’s executive director.
Other cities, like Chicago and Philadelphia, offer similarly discounted annual passes and cash payment options in addition to credit or debit cards.
To increase accessibility, MoGo at one time partnered with CVS, Family Dollar and 7-Eleven stores, where people who lacked credit or debit cards could pay cash to purchase annual memberships. When that option ended, MoGo began accepting cash for certain bike share services utilizing Cash App.
In 2018, MoGo collaborated with the Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT) to offer MoGo memberships to individuals who were already purchasing weekly, biweekly, or monthly bus passes. Ninety percent of people using the DDOTXMoGo pass were non-white and used the pass to get to and from work, and to connect to public transportation. Eighty-one percent had an income of less than $25,000 per year. MoGo hopes to expand upon this pilot by providing free transfers between bike share and transit, reducing the transportation costs for single trips.
Funding for equity
To cover the cost of equity programs, bike share operators are often helped by city and foundation funding from organizations like BBSP. Nathan McNeil, research associate at Portland State University’s Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning, wonders what will happen when those funds run out.
“A lot of the equity programs depend on small pots of money here and there. They are rarely built into the long-term funding streams of the system. Bike share isn’t like transit, in that we don’t tend to have large subsidies or taxes that go toward supporting it. That needs to change if bike share is going to become a substantial part of these communities and cities in general,” McNeil said.
While McNeil’s concern may be valid, Noa Banayan, director of federal affairs for PeopleForBikes, is optimistic. “Bike share and micro-mobility are new at a federal level. That’s allowed it some flexibility in terms of how funding moves to the states, cities and towns,” Banayan said. Greater flexibility increases the categories, such as carbon reduction, transit and equity, through which bike-share programs can qualify for funding.
“Congress is set to pass a five-year funding bill called Connecting America’s Active Transportation Act. In addition to prioritizing funding for marginalized communities, the bill — if passed — will increase support for networked bike lanes and supportive infrastructure,” Banayan continued.
Infrastructure improvements needed
While affordability has been one challenge for underserved communities, the physical condition of city infrastructure in disinvested neighborhoods is another. Streets and sidewalks may be in disrepair, bike lanes and signage may not be available, and some neighborhoods are often sandwiched between major roads and highways, which present challenges for residents who want to ride, but fear for their safety.
“There are things that have been unequitable about transportation that bleed into bike share,” says Hebert. “We build highways through a lot of these neighborhoods, which make it really hard to put in bike lanes and [make it] dangerous to bike at all. . . . We know that traffic violence is also higher in those neighborhoods, so all those factors have kind of made it so that bike shares are concentrated in areas with those who already have the most privilege,” Herbert said.
Yalinette Rivera works as a team leader for Chicago-based Northwest Side Housing Center (NWSHC), which services the middle-to-working class, predominantly Latino Belmont-Cragin neighborhood. She agrees traffic violence can dissuade people from biking.
“I actually got into an incident where I was riding between a moving car on one side, and a parked car on the other. When the driver unexpectedly merged where I was riding, I collided with the parked car. I’ll just be upfront, I haven’t had a good experience biking in the area since then,” Rivera said.
She says she  primarily takes buses now, but looks forward to the addition of bike lanes in her community sometime in July. “I see a lot of youth and elderly people using bikes as transportation. They need to be able to move around safely,” Rivera said.
According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), 843 bicyclists were killed in car crashes with motor vehicles in 2019. To prevent traffic violence or accidents, marginalized communities need bike-friendly and traffic-calming infrastructure, like updated signage, decreased speed limits, narrower car lanes, curb extensions, and networked bike lanes and circuits that connect riders to transit depots, schools, stores, and other routine destinations — sometimes without ever having to share the road with cars.
The City of Philadelphia currently has 200 miles of bike lanes and 360 miles of circuit trails for urban and suburban bike transit, and is developing a citywide network of bike-friendly streets as a part of a comprehensive, $3.7 million federally funded program. The linked lanes and circuits will also promote safer passages for bicyclists. One-third of the city’s bike share systems are in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, according to McNeil.
What the numbers tell us
In 2017, McNeil surveyed communities of color in Chicago’s Bronzeville and New York City’s Bed Stuy neighborhoods to gauge their interest in bike share programs. Bike shares had been negatively associated with neighborhood gentrification, inability to afford cars, and other inaccuracies. The survey showed 73 percent of the respondents were not concerned about those things at all and saw a need for bike share programs.
To combat misinformation, bike-share equity programs often utilize bike-share ambassadors — people who mirror their constituents — to make others aware of what bike shares are and how to use them. Working with bike-share operators, these programs often set up bike rides so first-time riders can experience the service firsthand, often free of charge.
As for Chicago’s Belmont-Cragin neighborhood, where over 27,000 young people under the age of 18 reside, they welcome bike-share programs.
“We have no El station in our community. The El doesn’t go west enough, so we are a 15-minute bus ride from the El to Belmont-Cragin. We’re left without transit options for our young folks. Biking and scooters have become the primary mode of transit,” says NWSHC executive director James Rudyk.
In 2018, the NWSHC surveyed area youth to identify issues affecting the neighborhood.
Lack of public transportation options and biking infrastructure were major concerns. The community currently has no bike-share systems, but as a result of a youth-led advocacy, they have worked with the Chicago Department of Transportation, Active Transportation Alliance (a nonprofit that advocates for bike safety), various city aldermen, Divvy Bike Share System, and BBSP to achieve some major transportation goals.
Equitable outcomes
By the end of July, the city plans to add five miles of bike lanes. Through BBSP’s Living Lab funding initiative, NWSHC will also purchase 100 Divvy for Everyone, $5-discounted annual membership passes, so residents will be able to afford to participate in the bike share when the bike stations are available.
NWSHC has also been pegged by Divvy to pilot a program that streamlines a stringent verification process from detailed paperwork and online submissions, to signing a waiver and purchasing the pass, according to Jose Cuebas, a NWSHC youth organizer.
Regarding local access to Chicago’s Divvy Bike Share System, Cuebas said,
“I don’t know why they didn’t put Divvys on the northwest side or the south side until last year. Maybe they don’t see the ridership among people [there], but that’s simply not true. We see people riding bikes every day. We see kids riding their bikes and others riding to work or riding to school, so we need options as well.”

The continent of Europe has been making strides in harnessing smart technologies alongside implementing traffic regulations to improve urban mobility. A Sustainable Mobility Report published in March 2020 by the European Cyclists’ Federation (ECF) concluded that France has the most effective off-street parking regulations in all of Europe. The report titled ‘Making Buildings Fit for Sustainable Mobility’ came to this conclusion after investigating a total of 56 off-street parking regulations for both cars and bicycles across 31 European cities.
Sustainable Mobility Report
The report also stated that France is the only country in Europe to have implemented maximum car parking norms as opposed to minimum parking requirements. They achieved this by restricting the number of car parking slots that can be built per housing unit. The ECF found that a theory that has gained merit in academic research circles is, that minimum availability of car parking promotes vehicular ownership and its use. Households own and use more cars and evade public transport if there is ample access to off-street parking.
Minimum parking requirements (MPRs) lead to an over-supply of parking spaces that negatively impact living costs and construction costs. Minimum car parking impositions have turned out to be detrimental to sustainable mobility.
Other than France, the cities of Berlin in Germany and Tyrol in Austria were found to have the most effective and sustainable parking legislations regionally. Whereas, Hungary, Lithuania, Slovenia, and The Netherlands stood out for providing citizens with sustainable parking solutions and facilities on a national level.
Sustainable parking practices encourage more efficient use of parking space in areas where mobility is problematic. These practices also include technology-driven solutions like ride-hailing, ride-sharing, smart parking, etc. to reduce demand for parking.
Since after this report was published, the ECF has been insisting that all national and local authorities in Europe impose a similar maximum parking policy instead of minimum parking restrictions (MPRs) and the corresponding mobility management services.
ECF’s senior policy officer who is also the report’s lead author declared that there is a need to make buildings more sustainable in terms of mobility and energy-efficiency. Doing away with minimum car parking regulations and installing maximum car limits is critical for delivering on the aforementioned objectives.
In Conclusion 
It can be said without a shred of doubt that a lot can be learned by the examples in parking regulations set by France. Furthermore, The ECF report is a first of its kind attempt at rigorously collecting, contrasting and ranking parking norms across Europe. Findings from this report will feed into making our surroundings more sustainable.

The Re:Move electric cargo mover prototype in actionPolestarVIEW 4 IMAGES
Earlier this year, Volvo-owned Polestar signaled its intentions to move beyond electric cars and into other forms of clean transport, introducing an electric transporter concept for carrying goods around urban areas. The company has now turned up to IAA 2021 in Germany with a fully-functioning prototype, which carries with it a few new details around how a production version of the so-called urban “sled” will work.
The Re:Move electric cargo mover concept was first revealed back in March and featured a highly practical flatbed design just begging to be loaded up with boxes, bags or other cargo. While originally listed as 600 lb (275 kg), the payload capacity has now been pared back to 396 lb (180 kg), though the Re:Move maintains a slim profile designed to suit most bike lanes, measuring just 750 mm (30 in) across.
Made from recyclable aluminum, the Re:Move’s chassis is fitted with an electric tilting mechanism to lean into corners and allow for a tight turning circle of less than 7 m (23 ft). A damped rear swing arm should make the ride a little less jarring for the people and items onboard, and disc brakes also feature for greater stopping power.
A 2.2-kWh battery pack powers the whole operation, with the Re:Move limited to a maximum speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph) in line with the electric bicycle laws of many jurisdictions. Always-on front lighting, brake lights, a horn and optional indicators are also onboard for the purposes of safety.
The Re:Move is the result of a collaboration between Polestar, e-bike-maker Cake, aluminum manufacturer Hydro, Wallpaper magazine, and industrial designer Konstantin Grcic. There are no figures offered on range at this point, nor on price or availability, but the designers are positioning the Re:Move as a cleaner alternative to delivery vans in cities, or even as a cargo transportation solution in rural areas.
“The passion and expertise our partners have brought to this project shows the power of great design,” says Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar CEO. “Electrifying vehicles is the start point, not the end game. Our engineers have proven that this kind of open collaboration will accelerate innovation and the shift to truly sustainable mobility.”

The last mile’s always there, always a challenge, always urgent – and never more so than when eCommerce explodes.
The prime mover advantage, of course, goes to the “King Kong” of eCommerce, which would be Amazon. You’ve likely experienced the compressed delivery times Amazon has been able to offer – what used to be two days’ delivery is now one – and in some cases, you can get what you want in a matter of hours.
A slew of other companies, across a slew of other verticals, have been pushing through their own innovative last-mile efforts to satisfy customers’ expectations, honed by the “Amazon effect,” that they can get what we want, pretty much when they want.
Amazon, of course, has not in any way been resting on logistics laurels. The firm has been extending its fulfillment footprint by leaps and bounds. As detailed by CFO Brian Olsavsky on its earnings call, the firm has increased its capacity by 50 percent through Amazon Logistics.
Logistics, he said, has been “a large area of investment – not only fulfillment centers, but also two elements of transportation, what we call the middle mile, where we’re putting sort centers, Amazon Air, line haul, trailers … think of all the intermediate movements between our warehouses and our final delivery stations.” The last mile includes the delivery service network, where “we see … the ability to control the whole flow of products from the warehouse to the end customer.” A majority of units, the company has said, are flowing through Amazon Logistics.
Groceries And Retail, By Air  
In the bid to modernize, streamline and speed delivery, we’re seeing efforts by other large, mainstream retailers to use high tech to gain an edge in reaching the customer at the doorstep across novel means.
As has been announced this month, Kroger and Drone Express have entered a pilot program to offer grocery delivery by drone in the Midwestern U.S. In terms of mechanics, package delivery is made to the location of a customer’s smartphone, not simply a street address, in some cases within a quarter of an hour. The company is providing bundled offerings such as baby care, or a “s’mores” bundle (with the ingredients for that particular snack). Walmart has had its own drone program in place, as reported in this space earlier in the year.
None of this is to say that more traditional players have been sitting still. FedEx late last year bought ShopRunner, an eCommerce platform, to shore up its eCommerce presence. That platform, the firms said upon news of the deal, connects millions of consumers to more than 100 brands with free two-day shipping and free returns.
(And, of course, delivery aggregators are still cementing their own presence with restaurants and other merchants.)
It would make sense that smaller enterprises would want to gain the scale and efficiencies that their larger brethren enjoy. And in another example, Shopify’s management said on the conference call with analysts that demand for its own fulfillment efforts has been strong. Shopify Shipping, according to management, said that its volume in the first quarter was roughly the same as the fourth quarter. The fulfillment network, the company has said, is geared toward firms that sell in the U.S. and have fewer than 200 SKUs. Those fulfillment centers pick, pack and ship products on behalf of the smaller merchants.
As the digital shift continues, it seems, there are many paths toward transforming the last mile.

 With public and private partners, Pittsburgh’s city government is the first in the country to launch a digital system coordinating local transit options. It represents the local entrance to an international sustainability-minded movement. 
 By Sophie Burkholder / STAFF 
Pittsburgh will soon be a national leader in mobility tech.
Earlier this month, the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure launched a two-year initiative called Move PGH, a comprehensive program convening private and public transportation options both physical and online to help Pittsburghers get where they need to go. Partners of the program include electric scooter rental company Spin, moped rental company Scoobi, local bike share system Healthy Ride, Waze Carpool and Transit, among others.
Move PGH centers around a robust app, powered by Transit, and 50 new physical mobility hubs across the city. While Transit has operated its services in Pittsburgh since 2013 and currently has over 40,000 users in the area, this new and improved digital hub will add even more transportation options to its current offerings.
Citing the recent growth of car ridesharing as well as shared bike and scooter systems, Move PGH underscores the need for a central place to find availability and pricing across all transportation options. Though Pittsburgh has been ranked as having the 15th best public transit system in the country and currently has 134,717 workers living within a half mile of transit, Port Authority has actually cut several services and routes over the last decade and saw sharp revenue drops during the pandemic.
Those cuts, paired with Pittsburgh’s hilly topography that can make walking or biking more difficult, mean that the 20% of residents without a car still struggle to get to work, the grocery store or other essential destinations. Transportation problems are inherently equity ones too, as over 65% of Pittsburgh’s low-income households don’t have access to a private car according to Move PGH.
One solution that’s gained popularity in recent years is what’s called Mobility as a Service, aka MaaS, which is the use of a digital platform to allows passengers to plan and pay for transportation across a wide range of public and private options. Such services could eventually make individual vehicle ownership obsolete.
“Mobility as a Service, ultimately, is about making sure people have access to the transportation services that can help them get around, easily, affordably, sustainably, when they need them,” said Transit Communications Lead Stephen Miller. “And so the City of Pittsburgh’s approach here was to really look at Mobility as a Service as a way to get these private companies and the public services that are available to really connect together and make sure that people in Pittsburgh have a way to access all of these together, rather than everybody kind of doing their own thing.”
While already a popular approach in Europe — with Helsinki planning to eliminate the need for personal cars by 2025 — Pittsburgh is the first city to adopt this approach in the United States. But Miller wasn’t surprised to see the local community pioneer this program. Unlike larger cities that often have a variety of extensive public transportation options, midsize cities like Pittsburgh have become more dominated by cars, giving local governments more urgency in connecting residents to alternative choices.
“It’s really forced a lot of cities and transit agencies in these types of midsize cities to think really creatively about how they can improve their services, and how they can be really thoughtful and creative about shifting trips to more sustainable options,” Miller said.
There are unique technical considerations as Mobility as a Service becomes widespread. A growing standard used in the field is the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), which several public transportation options, including Port Authority, have adopted as a way to share information with navigation apps like Transit or Google Maps. Meanwhile, many bikeshare companies use General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) while ride-hailing and taxi companies use General On-Demand Feed Specification (GOFS).
These differences aren’t a problem, Miller said: “Because each mode of transportation has different needs, it makes total sense that there would be different data standards for transit, scooters/bikeshare, and on-demand services.”
“Ultimately, all of these mobility pieces should be able to speak the same language and connect together so people can easily make these trips.”STEPHEN MILLER, TRANSIT
But there’s a challenge in making sure these standards are adopted broadly within the transportation field.
“Ultimately, all of these mobility pieces should be able to speak the same language and connect together so people can easily make these trips,” he said.
Beyond making transportation more accessible to residents, Mobility as a Service has the potential to significantly reduce emissions — a critical and persistent issue for Pittsburgh, which the American Lung Association recently ranked as the ninth worst city in the country for air quality.
Part of those pollution issues are undoubtedly associated with the heavy use of cars here. A September 2019 report from mobility analytics company INRIX showed that 23% of car trips in Pittsburgh were less than one mile, while 50% were less than three miles.
Miller sees Move PGH and future work in Mobility as a Service as a way of resolving that classic last-mile problem in transportation.
“Those are distances that are easily covered by either walking or biking or electric scooters or public transit,” he said. “And so making sure that we build up these options and make them easy enough to access for people so they’re not just grabbing the car keys to go a mile down the road is really important to shifting those trips to more sustainable modes.”

With a near monopoly on delivery, Amazon is understandably keen to make the job easier. The latest idea that may or may not eventually see the light of day is a new patent for a system where delivery vans would carry items almost to their destination, then send out and direct ground drones to do the final drop-off.
Amazon and other companies like UPS are already experimenting with drones that fly or drive to deliver everything from packages to pizza to medicine. But the humble delivery van doesn’t need to worry about being rendered redundant just yet – it turns out that drones are terribly inefficient on their own.
So in the new patent, Amazon describes how it would pair them with delivery vans to make both more efficient. First, a “primary vehicle” (read a van, truck, car etc) would be loaded up with items to be delivered, as well as secondary vehicles – either flying drones, small ground vehicles, or both. The idea is that the van would drive to the destination, park in the street, then send the smaller vehicle to drop the parcel at the doorstep or wherever it needs to go.
But here’s the clever bit – rather than load out each drone with its own sensors and pathfinding hardware, that can be outsourced to equipment back in the van. Cameras, radar, sonar, LiDAR, or other location sensors can analyze the best path for the drone to take, then beam the instructions to it wirelessly over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or the like.
The secondary vehicle could be equipped with some kind of marking, like a QR code or a logo, that the van’s camera can track as the drone moves around. If need be, it can then recalculate new paths or speeds to help the drone get around obstacles. After the drop-off has been made, the van can then instruct the drone on how to get back.
As with most patents, there are plenty of variations on this general scenario – the primary vehicle could be a van, truck, car, etc, and either autonomous or driven by humans. The secondary drone could crawl along on wheels or have legs like a Boston Dynamics robot, and may or may not have its own sensors. Entire fleets of these robots could service a neighborhood under the watchful eye of a single van.
Also like most patents, there’s no guarantee this system will ever actually get off the ground. But Amazon and other companies always want to be patenting new innovations, no matter how pie-in-the-sky, if just to keep the competition from stealing the best ideas. If everything in Amazon’s imagined patented future were to come to pass, we might have drones launching from airships, trains and huge hives, recharging at lamp posts, and dropping parcels with parachutes.

There are many data sets available to fleet managers, so implementing some best practices will help you maximize the functionality of your telematics systems and engage in useful data management.
Telematics can provide incredible insights to fleet managers about the productivity and safety of their drivers and fleet.
Furthermore, telematics systems that incorporate machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) can even help fleet managers predict potential issues to make impactful business decisions.
There are many data sets available to fleet managers, so implementing some best practices will help you maximize the functionality of your telematics systems and engage in useful data management.
Here are some dos and don’ts of telematics to help fleet managers stay on the right track.
DO
Implement a driver coaching systemThe data gathered from telematics systems illustrates certain modifications that could improve driver behavior. Implementing these modifications will result in a reduction of losses and increased safety on the roads.
A driver coaching program is both a written and verbal safety policy that clearly states driver expectations and performance. Encourage consistent communication with employees and establish a system for employees to provide feedback, address concerns or get their questions answered in a swift and easy manner.
Master the system you’re usingThe best way to get the most out of your telematics system is to take the time to learn it.
You may uncover beneficial use-cases for your particular industry that you may not have without knowing the full capabilities. Lean on your telematics provider’s training resources.
They should have an extensive learning/help center and provide role-based training sessions and courses so that your drivers and admins only need to learn what matters to their day-to-day use of the platform.
These courses can be offered live online or recorded for on-demand use. Take the time to learn your telematics program and about the various metrics you can measure and leverage.
Clearly define and communicate the key metrics that you want to trackPay attention to details but avoid obsessing over each tiny data point.
Telematics can provide fleet managers with a great deal of data, so it’s imperative to have goals and an overall operational plan. This could include benchmarks in driver productivity and efficiency, safety, fleet maintenance and any other business-related goals.
By spotlighting data that makes sense for your relevant objectives, it will allow you to adjust and make decisions that move the needle in a meaningful way for your set criteria.
Further to this point, be intentional with your internal communication plan and be transparent in sharing with employees which key performance indicators will be measured when they are hired. Have managers and team leads set clear expectations upfront regarding productivity and safety.
Fleet managers can garner driver buy-in for safety coaching programs and performance feedback reviews by consistently communicating with employees and establishing an efficient and easy system for employees to provide feedback, address concerns and have questions answered.
Another communication approach would be to start small and only focus on the most impactful metrics at first. Initially tracking only important data points— such as idling rates, delivery times and basic driving behaviors — can prevent drivers from feeling overwhelmed and heavily monitored when adopting a new telematics system, and fleet managers can always expand upon the initial list of tracked metrics as time goes on.
DON’T
Rely on telematics as the only way to evaluate employees and identify bad driversYes, it is important to carefully analyze the collected data, but do not use this as thesole form of driver evaluation. This could lead to distrust between managers and employees.
There may have been extenuating circumstances, such as traffic delays or road accidents, that caused a reduction in driver efficiency, so make sure to review the entire situation before labeling someone as a bad driver.
As discussed in the “dos,” a holistic approach to employee evaluation is rooted in open communication. By having conversations with customers, coworkers and – most importantly – the driver in question, you will gain a more accurate representation of an employee’s performance.
Be hard on employees when adopting your telematics softwareIt is natural for employees to be resistant or feel overwhelmed when a company implements new technologies.
Do not expect employees to embrace the system immediately. Give them time to feel it out, which will in time improve their overall performance. You also do not want to hide any information from employees. Instead, implement a user-friendly system and capitalize on transparency with employees. Hiding important information or eluding arduous questions will not lead to desired driver results.

 Integrating on-demand microtransit options into existing services allows agencies to better serve communities with affordable, convenient public transit, promoting economic mobility. 
By Kellie Meilleur
Nearly 70 percent of all Americans who depend on the bus for their transportation needs make less than $50,000 per year. This, according to a report by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), validates that lower-income individuals rely more heavily on public transportation than those who are earn higher incomes. 
Across the nation, more and more transit agencies and cities are turning to on-demand microtransit service to expand and improve public transportation options for low-income residents. 
What exactly is microtransit? Simply, microtransit is dynamic routing. It takes mobile smartphone apps and puts them to use to create an efficient mode of transport that adapts with each passenger’s trip needs. At the click of a button, passengers can book a trip that will take them on the quickest route to their desired destination.  
A distinctive aspect of microtransit, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, is that it is “a privately owned and operated shared transportation system that can offer fixed routes and schedules, as well as flexible routes and on-demand scheduling. The vehicles generally include vans and buses.” 
Microtransit can be easily accessible and highly efficient anda ‘no-brainer’ for many lower income individuals who can’t afford to own a car and have therefore been greatly underserved by traditional transit networks.
When COVID-19 first hit, a majority of higher income earners began working from home and using their personal vehicles for necessary travel. On the far end of the spectrum, millions of lower-income Americans didn’t have the same luxury or opportunity. They needed to get to and from their jobs and other destinations, despite sweeping changes in how transportation options had changed and disadvantaged many since the pandemic.  
That’s where microtransit in its many forms came into play, and in a big way. 
Many transit agencies, anxious to serve their most underserved customers and plug the gap between traditional fixed-route transportation and more individual transportation options, are offering riders fast and convenient ways to book their trips.  
Microtransit has proven to be a mobility lifeline. Amid the many shutdowns we have all experienced, on-demand transit has pivoted to serve specific community needs, such as food delivery to our most vulnerable community members and transporting hospital and other frontline workers to their jobs, even in the overnight hours. In fact, APTA’s data shows that dynamic, on-demand public transit has proven to be a mobility lifeline for those in low-income areas during this crisis.
Transit industry expert, thought leader and influencer Paul Comfort recently hosted a podcast segment on his show, Comfort’s Corner, about the role of microtransit for equity and inclusion. As a thought leader in the public transportation space, Comfort sees public transportation’s role as one to improve equity and inclusion for those who need it most.First, it was for the elderly and those with mobility challenges, and now, it’s for those who are underserved.
Comfort believes that microtransit is the hottest trend to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. When the pandemic hit, transportation providers made major changes to their service based on changing ridership demand and to adhere to health and safety requirements. This included altering transit routes and changing the frequency of trips. These changes immediately impacted those who had no other means of getting from point A to point B. The silver lining is that microtransit has been the solution to the transit shortage problem. Comfort explains that “microtransit fills the transit gaps, and it ensures that no one gets left behind.”  
The great news is that the stop-gap solution that microtransit provides is here to stay. Significant data across several U.S. cities has recently been gathered suggesting that microtransit has been a vital public resource for lower-income individuals since the start of the pandemic. This information, along with insights shared by transit thought leaders like Comfort, help the transportation industry to look ahead to the long-term need for microtransit as part of the equity and inclusion solution. 
By joining the microtransit movement and integrating on-demand options into existing public transit infrastructure, transit providers across the country can better serve their communities with affordable, convenient public transportation and promote economic mobility for all.

 Pittsburgh is a hub for AV development, and local companies are keeping sustainability in mind. But researchers and city officials still have concerns about the disruptive technology’s unknowns. 
By Sophie Burkholder
Though political fights and Tesla have pushed electric vehicles to the forefront of automobile industry news this year, one of Pittsburgh’s leading tech sectors could also be a key player in making transportation more sustainable than ever before.
Autonomous vehicles have a long history in Pittsburgh, starting with Carnegie Mellon University’s winning team in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. Since then, several companies in the sector have built their headquarters here, continually bringing jobs, wealth and engineering prowess to the area. Pittsburgh, for its part, has welcomed the new technology, starting with Mayor Bill Peduto’s early work in allowing Uber to test its initial fleet of autonomous cars.
While a full commercial launch of the technology is still yet to come, recent announcements from two area companies indicate that momentum is building. But for all of the new convenience and efficiency these cars might offer, their environmental advantages are somewhat more nuanced than those of electric vehicles, leaving some to wonder how they will operate in a world that is de-emphasizing the trend of automobile transportation in the name of climate change.
Pittsburgh pollution
The main environmental benefit that autonomous vehicles offer is their efficiency: “Autonomous vehicles, in general, operate more optimally,” Neil Donahue, the director of CMU’s Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education and Research told Technical.ly. “They’re less lead-footy.”
More efficient driving means more efficient fuel usage, which should reduce vehicle emissions. That should mean cars will have less wear and tear over time and last longer, reducing both physical and energy waste that can come from automobile manufacturing. While Donahue acknowledged that the reductions would be less immediate than those seen with a switch to electric cars, he noted that even a small change can make a major difference to the region’s air quality.
“Autonomous vehicles, in general, operate more optimally. They’re less lead-footy.”NEIL DONAHUE, STEINBRENNER INSTITUTE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
A research publication from June of last year led by CMU Associate Research Professor in Mechanical Engineering Albert Presto showed just how much local traffic emissions contribute to air pollution in Pittsburgh. He and his coauthors found that during the morning rush hour period after stay-at-home orders were put in place last spring, carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide levels decreased by about 50% — which was also the approximate percent decrease in traffic levels during that time. Notably, other major polluters in the area like the U.S. Steel-owned Mon Valley Works steel mills operated at the same production levels throughout this time period, as they were deemed an essential service.
Such a dramatic decrease in toxic emissions is uniquely significant to Pittsburgh, Donahue said. The region’s long recovery from the pollution of its industrial past paired with a topography defined by hills and valleys means that harmful particulates tend to linger and concentrate more here, and this study shows that vehicle emissions are responsible for a worrying amount of that.
Donahue sees all of this as a compelling reason to ensure all autonomous vehicles are electric, particularly as traditional car companies have started shifting to that technology.
“It matters where the electricity comes from,” he said, noting that many power plants still rely on fossil fuels. “But they are real wins in terms of the local air pollution.”
But ensuring that electric future happens isn’t always as simple as strapping autonomous technology onto an existing electric vehicle. The weight and energy requirements of the sensors and monitors needed already limit the range of traditional fuel-powered cars, and would likely require more frequent battery charging in electric models. Still, recent research from CMU has shown that the increased efficiency of the technology and certain design choices to reduce drag can make any difference in the driving range for electric autonomous vehicles negligible.
Pittsburgh plans
Local companies are keeping that in mind. Argo AI, which recently announced a new partnership to launch its first product with Ford and Lyft at the end of this year, has plans to develop an autonomous version of the electric microbus Volkswagen ID.Buzz for launch by 2025.
“Looking further out, we would expect all of our vehicles that we’d work with to be electric going forward,” Argo AI Director of Communications Alan Hall said. For now, tests of the company’s autonomous technology are done on older 2016 or 2017 hybrid car models.
Aurora, another local autonomous vehicle company that just shared plans to go public through a SPAC, also sees electrification as a goal for its technology.
“The Aurora Driver is designed to work across all vehicle platforms, including EVs, and we’re working with a range of vehicles readily available from our partners,” a spokesperson for the company said via email.
Even larger vehicle-focused companies like autonomous trucking firm Locomation, which has offices in the Strip District’s Robotics Row, want to see an electrified future for its technology, though the challenge there is much greater in terms of distance traveled and vehicle weight. Pointing to recent reports on the increasing availability of electric passenger cars, Locomation VP of Policy and Strategy Finch Fulton said “you’re seeing a lot of improvements on charging speed, charging capacity, and the range of vehicles.”
While that shows promise for smaller autonomous vehicles, Fulton — who formerly worked for the Department of Transportation — added that “the Department of Energy estimates that for Class 8 multi-motor vehicles, those will not be technically and economically feasible until 2030 or 2032.” But when that technology becomes available, it will undoubtedly address concerns around vehicles that still use diesel, which is known to produce higher levels of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides than gasoline-powered vehicles.
Locomation is also looking for ways to reduce the kinds of emissions that are unique to long-distance trucking, Fulton said. When human truck drivers need to take a break for sleep, they often do so in small cabins within the trucks, which typically need to use energy to be heated or cooled depending on the weather. But autonomous trucks wouldn’t have that problem — no one in the cabin to keep comfortable — and removing or reducing idling from even one truck could save up to 1,200 gallons of diesel and 24,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emitted per year, according to a report from the North American Council for Freight Efficiency.
Automated trucks would also benefit from speed control and smooth driving efficiency that smaller autonomous vehicles have. The negative impact on the environment would likely be less if trucks were programmed to go at a slower, more efficient and steady speed. Trucks traveling at a speed of 75 miles per hour, for instance, will burn 27% more fuel than ones traveling at 65 miles per hour, Finch noted.
Pittsburgh policy
Though local analysts, policymakers and researchers alike look forward to the myriad environmental gains of autonomous vehicle technology, many also remain wary about the rollout of this disruptive technology. Eric Beckman, the faculty co-director of the University of Pittsburgh’s Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation is particularly worried about what conservation and energy economists call the rebound effect.
“I think most people who look at autonomous vehicles, and are also interested in sustainability, worry about this kind of rebound impact where actually you can get more miles driven when it’s autonomous, because it’s so easy,” he said.
“I think most people who look at autonomous vehicles, and are also interested in sustainability, worry about this kind of rebound impact where actually you can get more miles driven when it’s autonomous.”ERIC BECKMAN, MASCARO CENTER FOR SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION
People who might have walked or biked somewhere before might more frequently turn to an autonomous vehicle in the future simply because the option might be more accessible to them. If that happens, Beckman sees the possibility of a scenario where autonomous vehicles are actually worse for the environment, since people would start using them more often than they used traditional cars. But he also thinks that fate is avoidable, so long as local officials and companies alike remain mindful of it as the technology becomes more present here.
“It’s kind of an unknown right now,” he said. “And until these things become more ubiquitous on the roads, I don’t know how we’re going to guess” what the outcome will be.
That one of many potential concerns Erin Clark, a policy analyst in the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure, hopes to help resolve as autonomous vehicles become more present on city roads.
Though autonomous vehicle companies operate in the private sector, she and other City officials have worked to establish a relationship with local company leaders so that they can discuss strategies to avoid factors that could lead to such a rebound effect. Some of that work, she said, includes making sure these cars don’t compete with current public transportation systems or preventing the cars from “traveling zombie miles, looking for people to pick up.”
But Clark also acknowledges that the landscape is still constantly shifting around autonomous vehicles, and that much of the regulatory process around them could remain unknown until closer to a full commercial launch. Nonetheless, she shares the concerns of both Donahue and Beckman, and feels that the City’s continued conversations with companies about this technology will resolve any issues in its adoption along the way.
“I think having these conversations early and often with the private sector ensures that we’re saying our expectations to them,” Clark said. “We want this technology to advance because we think it could save lives and make people safer and hopefully, make transportation a bit more sustainable.”

Hyundai launched the first vehicle in its new all-electric Ioniq brand back in February, the almost-true-to-concept Ioniq 5 hatchback. And now the company has partnered with autonomous vehicle company Motional to put the shapely EV to work as a robotaxi.
The Ioniq 5 is based on Hyundai’s Electric-Global Modular Platform, with its 118-in (3,000-mm) wheelbase making for a relatively large cabin so that occupants can stretch out and enjoy the journey. The vehicle comes in several battery and motor configurations, and it’s not clear which setup will be used for the robotaxi variant at this stage.
But, by way of an example, the vehicle could run on a 72.6-kWh long-range battery pack for a per-charge WLTP range of up to 298-miles (480-km), and roll with a single-motor RWD option that puts out 258 lb-ft (350 Nm) of torque and zips from standstill to 62 mph (100 km/h) in 7.4 seconds.
Not that such things will be important to ride-hailing passengers, who are promised “a spacious, comfortable place to work, relax, or socialize during their driverless ride.” And should customers wish to amend the route along the way, or make additional stops, the vehicle will be equipped with rider-focused interfaces to allow for communication with onboard navigation systems.
The partnership is looking to make the Ioniq 5 robotaxi a Level 4 autonomous vehicle, which will use its suite of more than 30 sensors mounted around the vehicle to navigate without the need for a safety driver behind the steering wheel. This sensor suite of cameras, radars and LiDAR will monitor the world around the vehicle at up to 300 m (984 ft) away, and feed data into Motional’s driverless technology suite.
Numerous redundancies are being built into the setup to ensure smooth operation and passenger safety during autonomous driving, though Motional technicians will be able to remotely take control should the vehicle get into trouble.
The robotaxi is expected to undergo many months of rigorous testing in simulated environments, on closed courses, and on public roads, before accepting it’s first passenger, with Motional saying that the “testing is only completed once we’re confident our robotaxis are safer than a human driver.”
Motional has teamed up with ride-hailing service Lyft, and will begin ferrying passengers in Ioniq 5 robotaxis from 2023 across major US cities. But before then, the vehicle will make its public debut at the IAA Mobility in Munich expo, which runs from September 7-12.

Imagine a robot riding the elevator up your tower block, knocking on your door, and delivering the package you ordered an hour earlier: That’s the future of e-commerce in China. 
Tech giant Alibaba Group sees a fleet of robots as a fast, reliable and relatively cheap way to fulfill the burgeoning demand for online shopping across China, the world’s largest consumption market. 
In a big step towards hitting this goal, Alibaba is deploying 1,000 delivery bots across Chinese university campuses and urban communities this year. The bots, called Xiaomanlv or “small donkey” in Mandarin, can deliver about 50 packages at a time and as many as 500 boxes in one day, covering 100 kilometers on a single charge.
The bots pick up parcels at a local courier drop-off point and make their way to your building, trundling along sidewalks and in bicycle lanes. To be sure, they can’t navigate a flight of stairs yet, but the technology is steadily improving. 
In the future, the bots could gradually replace forklifts in factories, dispose of medical waste in hospitals and even move luggage around airports.
The idea is that these bots will “learn” how to navigate obstacles safely in low-speed minor roads and cul-de-sacs, such as serving a college campus or within a housing estate. Damo Academy will analyze insights gathered from these early models and then upgrade the bots to be safe to maneuver even on public roads.  
“In three to five years, we hope to make progress in autonomous driving in faster speed scenarios and make deliveries over longer distances,” said Wang Gang, head of Damo Autonomous Driving Lab in Hangzhou, in an interview with Alizila.Play VideoDelivery bots fan out on a university campus to deliver parcels
Last-mile delivery has always been the knotty problem of e-commerce. It’s costly, time-consuming and largely unmapped. This final leg in a journey that stretches from the manufacturer to the buyer can flummox human couriers. Delivery people can get lost trying to find a flat in a tower block or navigate a large housing estate. 
Alibaba’s robots will be able to make the trip without deviations or smoke breaks. Alibaba’s algorithm plots the fastest route for the robot to your door. 
The robot can predict the intended movement of passengers and vehicles up to 5 to 10 seconds in the future and safely avoid collisions. In test runs, 99.9999% of the time, the Xiaomanlv’s auto-driving algorithm manages without human intervention. For industry experts, this is known on a scale of Levels 0 to 5, as Level 4 meaning a high degree of automation.
The very top of the automation spectrum, Level 5, seems like a distant nirvana for autonomous-driving experts, given the reams of traffic data needed to make the robots and self-driving cars safe to travel on busy public roads. 
Level 4 is sufficient to solve the last-mile conundrum of e-commerce. More importantly, the robot’s positioning technology allows it to operate even where there’s weak or no GPS signal, making it a reliable deliveryman even outside China’s supercities.
China’s e-commerce market is the largest in the world and its growth has stimulated the swift development of logistics to fulfill customers’ orders. The coronavirus pandemic has also accelerated the shift in consumption from offline to online and heightened customers’ demand for contactless delivery of packages.  
Package deliveries topped 830 billion in mainland China last year, nine times the volume of 2013, according to China’s Post Office.
At the same time, there are fewer able-bodied couriers in China, one of the fastest aging populations globally. The World Health Organization expects the percentage of people over 60 years old in China to hit 28% by 2040.“We do not have enough labor to deliver so many packages to consumers … it’s impossible without automated technologies. So, this is why Xiaomanlv is very important,” said Damo Academy’s Wang, who is a key man in Alibaba’s drive to develop the bots. He spent over a decade researching artificial intelligence as an academic and now wants to put theory into practice. 
“I hope to build AI products that can have practical application and a big social impact, rather than academic impact,” said Wang. “Alibaba’s Damo Academy’s objective is to develop products that can be used – so this aligns well with my motivation.”
As consumers demand faster and more flexible delivery schedules, e-commerce companies are racing to rewire their logistics networks. The Hangzhou-headquartered group offers customers in China one-hour delivery, half-day delivery and next-day delivery. 
“Nowadays, consumers have higher expectations such as delivery to their building so that they do not have to walk for miles to get their package,” said Wang.  
Damo Academy is working closely with Alibaba’s logistics arm Cainiao to deploy the bots, known in the industry as autonomous mobile robots. 
Delivery companies such as FedEx and UPS still handle most packages globally. However, a few retailers are exploring more cutting-edge solutions such as drone deliveries. That said, there are relatively few drones in circulation, given the high level of regulatory clearance needed. Delivery robots, or bots, on the other hand hold more promise in terms of mass deployment. 
Big breakthroughs in the field of autonomous driving have largely depended on that lightning bulb moment when one or two engineers find inspiration from years of research. Many companies are still developing prototypes when it comes to autonomous driving, particularly when it comes to carrying passengers.  
Alibaba’s approach is to build steadily on the insights gleaned from the bots already in action, increasing the likelihood of developing a more mature and useful algorithm rather than relying on engineers in the lab.  
Wang believes that Alibaba’s algorithm is strong enough not to need expensive, high-definition sensors that some companies’ prototypes need to navigate.
“So, we can lean more on our algorithm to achieve a low-cost, mass deployment of the robots,” said Wang.

Artificial Intelligence. Machine Vision. Big Data. There’s a lot of buzz around advanced technology being applied in nearly every sector from construction and field services, to trucking and logistics. Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai recently said the development of AI was more profound for humans than fire and electricity. 
But let’s talk about the bottom line: how can these technologies, when used together, create opportunities to most effectively drive down costs and generate revenue?
Going beyond video
The most advanced machine vision algorithms can be trained to detect just about anything the human eye can see. Fleets have used this capability to optimize safety training and driver retention, and also collect evidence that can help lower liability costs in traffic incidents and reduce insurance premiums.
But this technology excels when data, machine vision (MV), and artificial intelligence (AI) are used in concert (MV+AI) to provide a more holistic context to events. As an example, a collision happened when a fleet vehicle collided with a car while both vehicles were merging onto the freeway, making it difficult to establish the sequence of events just based on video.
When combining the metadata from the video feed with the ECM data from the vehicle, and predictive data from a MV stream, the usage of turn signals and acceleration/deceleration by the driver were related to the event.
This data, combined with the video, helped establish that the carrier’s driver did not cause of the collision. When we solve patterns like this, we are able to further use machine learning and artificial intelligence to extend this sort of pattern analysis to other similar, unrelated events at large scale to automatically establish their contexts.
Identifying customer needs
MV+AI can also detect otherwise innocuous elements in an environment that, when combined with customer data, reveal opportunities for fleets to expand services to existing clients or even generate new customer leads.
These can arise not only during a driver’s route but at the point of dispatch or delivery. A waste disposal company that uses MV+AI could detect when a customer’s bins are overflowing and automatically suggest additional collection service that the disposal company can provide within the customer’s budget.
The company could also detect overflowing bins at locations along its regular routes and, combined with mapping data, reveal potential new customer leads or upsell opportunities. As an example, intelligent video can help identify specific areas where overgrown trees need to be trimmed away from power lines. Another example, related to municipal services and safety, is detecting broken traffic lights, faded lane markings, or missing traffic signs.
Predicting events
Ever since the invention of the fuel gauge, monitoring the mechanics of vehicles has been a key part of optimizing vehicle management and reducing costs.
But now we can go a step further. Pairing data from vehicle monitoring systems connected to the engine control module with a predictive AI means fleets can anticipate and prepare for maintenance. Optimizing maintenance operations also helps to prevent risks such as an engine failing while operating at 60 mph on a freeway, which can create a dangerous situation for all drivers on the road.
The further ahead fleets can plan repairs, the better position they are in to minimize the costs and disruption to operations. And the less time a service vehicle is in the shop, the more time it can spend in the field serving clients and generating revenue.
Reducing internal silos
Using all three – MV, AI, and data – together and concurrently across a fleet unlocks the true value of these technologies.
Having a single pane of control across company departments allows for the reduction in internal silos and reduces the risk that one priority for the company is optimized at the expense of others. In fact, using data in isolation can become detrimental.
An example that comes up time and again is the importance of compliance and safety departments using the same technology and data to make decisions in real-time. Drivers, for example, are limited in the number of consecutive hours they spend behind the wheel for compliance reasons. If fleets only optimized for compliance, a siloed system would just select the next available driver, rather than the next available driver with an appropriate safety rating.
Neglecting to look at complete data can be a major pitfall for companies and can result in leaving money on the table or increasing rather than reducing operational risks.
The future of data
Data is often the biggest asset a company has, and we anticipate that in the future more companies will use it as a source of revenue itself.
All operational companies, whether freight or otherwise, have something in their data that would be useful to other segments in their industry.  The data on the maintenance costs of a 5,000-vehicle fleet could, for example, provide valuable lead generation insights to a maintenance company. The safety data of drivers in different geographic areas would allow insurance companies to more accurately assess the risk scores of potential clients in the region.
In the future, smart cities will include this type of data, too. A fleet’s route data on hazards or traffic would be crucial for local governments when it comes to city planning or providing services such as waste or tree removal. Fleets might eventually be buying anonymized data from other fleets as a way to share intelligence on equipment that both use and uncover patterns that help optimize their use and lifespan.
Provided that the proper steps are taken to de-identify data, the future points to more robust data marketplaces where companies and even fleets turn their data into a valuable revenue generator.
As MV+AI and data capabilities become more commonplace and widespread, the fleets that can use it most efficiently to capture revenue and break down silos will have the edge.

The Chinese tech giant shared its vision for mobility of the future in the form of a robocar, capable of Level 5 autonomous driving capabilities.The company also launched Kunlun 2, its second-generation AI chip aimed at areas including autonomous driving.Baidu has focused on diversifying its business beyond advertising to artificial intelligence and driverless cars.
Back in May this year, a commercial driverless taxi service was launched in China by the country’s biggest search engine player, Baidu. It was the first mass-produced robotaxi in China and Baidu did not slow down ever since. The company that has been building AI programs to power self-driving cars just unveiled its first “robocar” and a second-generation artificial intelligence chip for driverless vehicles.
Announced at its annual Baidu World conference recently, the AI-packed announcement showcases the company’s advances in an eight-year effort to develop autonomous-driving technology. It also underscores how these new areas of technology are key to the company’s future growth.
As described by CEO of Baidu himself Robin Li, “We believe that cars of the future will be robocars.” In fact, Baidu’s latest ‘robocar’ prototype is capable of Level 5 autonomous driving capabilities. “They will drive autonomously, act as both an intelligent assistant and loyal companion, and be self-learning,” he told an online audience.Dashveenjit Kaur |
Li believes intelligent vehicles of the future will be more like intelligent robots. “They will move, they will communicate, and they will learn. The robocar will not only be your vehicle, but also your driver, secretary, and personal assistant. It will drive automatically, understand your words, take orders and continuously learn from you and upgrade to serve you a more personalized experience,” he explained.
Baidu’s ‘robocar’
The robocar adopts a boxy shape and features gullwing doors as well as a transparent glass roof and a display at the front to visually communicate with its surroundings. The body is integrated with a suite of external sensors to enable its autonomous driving capabilities, which at Level 5, means the vehicle is capable of driving on its own under all conditions
As of now, there are no Level 5 autonomous vehicles being sold in the market, and most robotaxis being tested by other companies operate at Level 4, requiring certain conditions to be met before they can engage in autonomous driving. The robocar’s interior reflects its self-driving capabilities, as it contains zero-gravity seats, a widescreen curved display, and a control pad, with the steering wheel and pedals notably missing. 
Other tech bits here include voice and facial recognition, along with an advanced AI system that analyses the internal and external surroundings to provide predictive suggestions to proactively serve the needs of passengers.
The robocar, however, is still a prototype and the company has yet to confirm if it will be mass-produced. Even before revealing the robocar, Baidu already runs its Apollo robotaxi service in some cities in China and as of the end of the second quarter of this year, the service has provided more than 400,000 rides and driven more than 14 million km.
Baidu began developing autonomous driving tech in 2013, ahead of its competitors, and in 2017, it launched the Apollo open-source self-driving development platform. The platform has attracted Chinese government support as well as powerful partners like Toyota Motor and Volkswagen, along with tech companies Intel and Nvidia.
AI chip for self-driving technology
In 2018, Baidu launched its first-generation Kunlun chip. On Wednesday, during a conference, the company said it has begun mass producing Kunlun 2, its second-generation AI chip. The semiconductor is designed to help devices process huge amounts of data and boost computing power.
Baidu says the chip can be used in areas such as autonomous driving as it races to become a key player in the chip industry which Beijing is trying to strengthen. The new generation of Kunlun AI chips, using 7 nm process technology, achieved a top computational capability two to three times the previous generation, Baidu said in a statement.
Kunlun chips have been used mostly by Baidu in smart electric vehicles and cloud computing.

 Can the e-bicycle or the e-scooter be the answer to tackle congestion? Car makers think they have the answer 
By  S Muralidhar 
The pandemic and its fallout is going to have a profound impact on all our personal mobility needs and consequently on the automobile industry. The impact will unravel over the next few months, even as countries around the world and our own states around the country attempt to return to normalcy after the series of lockdowns.
 There are differing views on what might turn out to be the future mega trends within the automotive space, with opinions ranging from a surge in demand for new cars and bikes due to the continued fear of taking public transport, to a sharp rise in sales of low-cost options like used cars due to job losses and salary cuts. Contrarian views are also being expressed about the prospects of electric vehicles- with ones that say the heightened awareness about the environment could quicken the transition to EVs, while others are speculating that the crash in oil prices will end up delaying EV adoption.
Meanwhile, the fear of community transmission of this virus and the need for social distancing is going to stay with us for years to come. And if the new normal needs new tools for people to stay safe while seeking to commute to work or go shopping, they will eventually be developed by automobile companies.
 One of the conceptual product trends of last year that seems like the kind of thing that might find resonance in a post-pandemic world is the last mile mobility e-bike. An electric bike that can be folded or otherwise easily stored inside the car and can be used for scooting to locations that are a short distance away from your parked car. Or at other times can simply be ridden to a workplace that is not too far. 
The concept will find a lot of new takers amongst those who still seek the comfort and safety offered by personal mobility even after they need to step out of their cars. It could also help ease parking woes and congestion in city centres. For now, it is a mix of car companies that are launching branded electric bicycles to ride the rising wave of environment-consciousness amongst buyers (like Jeep) and others who are hoping to pair an e-bike or e-scooter with their future EVs. Here are a few examples of that are already available at showrooms and some that will make it in future vehicles. Will you be riding one too?
Audi e-tron scooter
Audi had officially unveiled the e-tron in India, its fully electric compact SUV, last year. While the final word on its Indian launch is still awaited, here’s something else the German luxury car maker has been working on.
The Audi e-tron Scooter, is meant for first mile and last mile connectivity. It combines the advantages of an electric scooter and the skateboard. It can be transported by car, bus or train, and the 12kg e-scooter can be folded up and conveniently stored in the back of the car, or if preferred pulled like a trolley. 
The 4-wheeled Scooter’s handling is said to be like surfing waves. Audi says that the rider has one hand free, and so is able to look around and give hand signals. Production and sales are planned for late 2020. The steering handle gives stability, holds the battery and the electronics, and carries a display showing the battery status. Riders can accelerate and brake by means of a twist grip.
 The range of 20kms is achieved through recuperation when the e-scooter brakes. The hydraulic foot brake provides additional safety. Audi had said that at the end of 2020, private customers will be able to buy the e-tron Scooter for about Euros 2,000. Audi also plans to offer it as an extra to customers who buy Audi e-tron models. The e-scooter could be charged in the car trunk through a dedicated socket.
 BMW E-Scooter The other German luxury car maker BMW had announced plans to develop a simple multi-modal mobility solution in the form of a e-scoot that could be easily folded and tucked away into its cars for use later The new BMW E-Scooter gets a range of twelve kilometres and a top speed of 20 kmph. Two separate braking systems and embedded front and rear lights provide the requisite safety on the road. 
This easily foldable scooter, weighs just nine kilograms and yet, boasts the space-saving design of a city scooter. The 150-watt motor and lithium-ion battery slip away almost out of sight into the footplate and rear wheel. It takes just two hours for a full charge of the E-Scooter’s battery. Created as part of the first collaboration between the BMW Group and Micro Mobility, there is also another lower priced adjustable BMW City Scooter option that allows the rider to take it with them everywhere thanks to its triple-secured folding and locking mechanism. It was launched last year and is said to retail for about Euro 800.
Hyundai and Kia
In a move that could benefit both sister brands Hyundai and Kia, the Hyundai Motor Group had last year announced that future vehicles, sporting either badge, may be offered with an in-built e-scooter. The new prototype electric scooter unveiled in mid-2019 is based on its initial concept presented at CES 2017. The model has rear-wheel drive, a lithium battery and stylish front and rear lights.
The latest concept features in future Hyundai Motor Group plans to enable first- and last-mile mobility by integrating the scooter with future vehicles.
When mounted on a vehicle, the scooter is charged automatically using electricity produced while driving, ensuring that the user can complete their journey seamlessly. The Group’s engineers have added suspension to the front wheel to provide a smoother ride, even on rough surfaces.
The latest version of Hyundai Motor Group’s e-scooter features a 10.5 Ah lithium battery. This enables the scooter to achieve a top speed of 20kmph and is sufficient to power the scooter for around 20kms on a single charge. Weighing around 7.7kgs, the scooter is highly portable, with its unique tri-folding design, it also features a digital display that shows battery status and speed; while, for nighttime riding, the scooter is equipped with two stylishly curved front LED headlights, and two rear tail lamps. The Group engineers plan to install a regenerative braking system to increase the scooter’s range by 7 per cent.
Jeep E-Bike
If adventure and sports is your focus, then this one is for you. The American brand that makes legendary off-road sports utility vehicles has been one of the latest entrants into the e-bike category. In keeping with the brand’s DNA, the Jeep E-Bike is a full suspension electric mountain bike that combines the versatility of a 4.8-inch fat tyre platform enabling it to tackle difficult off-road conditions including soft sand, snow and also hardpack trails and rocks. It’s 750W electric motor delivers 160Nm of torque via pedal assist or by using a thumb throttle. To handle rough off-road conditions, the ultra-stiff inverted front suspension fork comes with 150mm of travel and the rear wheel suspension travel is 120mm.
It also gets a 10-speed gear set and 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes which are paired with 203mm petal disc rotors. The Jeep E-Bike is a Class 2 electric bicycle under US classification rules and so it has a maximum speed limit of about 32kmph.
The Jeep E-Bike has been developed with specialist company QuietKat and it has a range of about 64kms on a full charge. The only figure that might deflate your enthusiasm may be the hefty sticker price of nearly $ 6,000. No information yet if Jeep India will officially bring this here.

Clean Air Express and Santa Barbara MTD give customers options to tap-to-ride as a result of a California Integrated Travel Project contactless payment demonstration. 

Clear Air Express buses and Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (MTD) buses are being outfitted with contactless payment options.  
The fare payment system is being made available as part of a six-month demonstration with the California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP), an initiative of the California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA) and California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to simplify travel by increasing access to public transit—including easier, faster payments via contactless credit/debit/prepaid cards and mobile wallets on smart devices. 
The contactless payment system for Santa Barbara MTD and Clean Air Express is the first to be introduced among public transit providers in the Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo tri-county region and one of the first three systems to be deployed statewide. The tap-to-ride system uses fare payment technology provided by Littlepay, Kuba, Cybersource and Elavon.  
“Older fare collection systems create unnecessary barriers for people to ride and choose transit,” said Marjie Kirn, executive director of Santa Barbara County Association of Governments, which operates the Clean Air Express. “With the new contactless payment system, customers can now pay their fare the same way they can buy a coffee or groceries by simply tapping a credit, debit card or using a mobile wallet on a smart phone or watch with no registration or account setup needed.” 
In addition to Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards with tap-to-pay capabilities, mobile payments options include Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay and Fitbit Pay. While registration or account setup will not be required to use the system, an online portal will be available to all customers paying with a card who need a receipt or would like to check their recent rides and fare payments. 
“We are excited to introduce this convenient payment option for our riders,” said Jerry Estrada, general manager of Santa Barbara MTD. “We’re piloting this technology on 10 of our buses, serving Lines 12x and 24x. This means you’ll be able to get to UCSB, Downtown Santa Barbara, Camino Real Marketplace and Old Town Goleta with a simple tap of a card or device.” 
Clean Air Express and Santa Barbara MTD customers will see contactless payment readers installed at the front of the designated buses. If a customer’s debit or credit card is valid and has the contactless symbol on it or if they use a mobile payment option, they can tap it on the payment reader, look for a green checkmark on the payment reader’s screen and take a seat to ride. 
“Much of our goal is a more modern and consistent transportation experience throughout California,” said Caltrans Director Toks Omishakin. “Allowing riders to pay for transit with the same methods they use elsewhere not only increases efficiency and mobility, but also reduces barriers to using public transportation.” 
Automatic fare capping enables both transit providers to offer riders the ability to pay-as-they-go to receive multi-ride discounts when riders tap to pay with the same contactless payment card or device throughout the day or within a 30-day period. 
Santa Barbara MTD customers pay the standard adult fare of $1.75. Riders using the same payment card or device with the new system will automatically not be charged more than $6 a day or $52 in a 30-day period, which is equivalent to purchasing a one-day or 30-day pass.  
Santa Barbara MTD buses with the contactless payment capability will have a special decal next to the front door of the bus, labeled with “Tap to Pay” and the contactless indicator symbol. 
Clean Air Express customers using the contactless payment system will be charged $6, a $1 discount from the standard $7 one-way cash fare. Existing Clean Air Express multi-ride fare discounts are honored with the new system, with riders automatically not being charged more than $10 per day—or $150 over 30 days—when using the same payment card or device. 
Clean Air Express and Santa Barbara MTD still accept physical passes and cash payments. The contactless payment option is just one more way to pay a fare—and to do so in a quick, secure way on both transit providers.

Dominos, FedEx, Kroger, Walmart, Alibaba, JD.com, and Meituan all use rolling robots today.[1] Previously, ARK estimated that a sidewalk robots could deliver food orders for as little as 6 cents per mile, 20 times less than the cost of human delivery. Although local regulations may slow down the rollout of sidewalk robot systems, slightly larger robots that can integrate with traffic could pick up the slack. According to ARK’s latest research, integrated traffic robots similar to those from Nuro could deliver food for less than 40 cents per trip, six times less than the cost of a personal trip to the grocery store, as shown below.

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon.
Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, based on data sourced from Internal Revenue Service
If every household in the US were to use robot delivery for groceries, today’s average of 1.6 trips per week per household would translate into a $4 billion market opportunity.[2] Moreover, the cost and convenience could encourage customers to order groceries in smaller batches at higher frequency. If customers were to order fresh groceries five times a week, for example, ARK estimates the robot grocery delivery market could expand to $12 billion a year, paling in comparison to the roughly $70 billion cost of all household grocery deliveries in the US, accounting for personal car transportation costs and the “unpaid labor” associated with such trips, as shown below.

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon.

ARK estimates that robot delivery of groceries would commercialize roughly $40 billion in unpaid wages, converting previously unmeasured economic activity into paid services. In addition, roughly $6 billion in gasoline demand would disappear as electric robots increasingly replace gas powered cars, eliminating roughly 18 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, the equivalent of that associated with 4 million cars on the road.[3]
ARK believes that the use cases for robot delivery will extend past groceries. Dominos would create a $500 million opportunity, for example, if robots were deliver its pizzas.[4] Ground robot delivery networks also could work alongside delivery drones, reshaping consumer behavior by providing inexpensive and convenient ways to receive groceries, take-out food, and other household essentials. Home designs probably would change as well. If customers were to order fresh groceries more often, refrigerators probably would shrink in size and pantry closets would be repurposed. While these changes probably will take time to penetrate households, ARK estimates that the total available market (TAM) associated with collapsing the costs of last mile delivery and transforming how consumers buy, store, and consume food will be roughly $30 billion in the US alone.[5]

 With public and private partners, Pittsburgh’s city government is the first in the country to launch a digital system coordinating local transit options. It represents the local entrance to an international sustainability-minded movement.  Pittsburgh will soon be a national leader in mobility tech. 
By Sophie Burkholder / STAFF 
Earlier this month, the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure launched a two-year initiative called Move PGH, a comprehensive program convening private and public transportation options both physical and online to help Pittsburghers get where they need to go. Partners of the program include electric scooter rental company Spin, moped rental company Scoobi, local bike share system Healthy Ride, Waze Carpool and Transit, among others.
Move PGH centers around a robust app, powered by Transit, and 50 new physical mobility hubs across the city. While Transit has operated its services in Pittsburgh since 2013 and currently has over 40,000 users in the area, this new and improved digital hub will add even more transportation options to its current offerings.
Citing the recent growth of car ridesharing as well as shared bike and scooter systems, Move PGH underscores the need for a central place to find availability and pricing across all transportation options. Though Pittsburgh has been ranked as having the 15th best public transit system in the country and currently has 134,717 workers living within a half mile of transit, Port Authority has actually cut several services and routes over the last decade and saw sharp revenue drops during the pandemic.
Those cuts, paired with Pittsburgh’s hilly topography that can make walking or biking more difficult, mean that the 20% of residents without a car still struggle to get to work, the grocery store or other essential destinations. Transportation problems are inherently equity ones too, as over 65% of Pittsburgh’s low-income households don’t have access to a private car according to Move PGH.
One solution that’s gained popularity in recent years is what’s called Mobility as a Service, aka MaaS, which is the use of a digital platform to allows passengers to plan and pay for transportation across a wide range of public and private options. Such services could eventually make individual vehicle ownership obsolete.
“Mobility as a service, ultimately, is about making sure people have access to the transportation services that can help them get around, easily, affordably, sustainably, when they need them.”STEPHEN MILLER, TRANSIT
 “And so the City of Pittsburgh’s approach here was to really look at Mobility as a Service as a way to get these private companies and the public services that are available to really connect together and make sure that people in Pittsburgh have a way to access all of these together, rather than everybody kind of doing their own thing.”
While already a popular approach in Europe — with Helsinki planning to eliminate the need for personal cars by 2025 — Pittsburgh is the first city to adopt this approach in the United States. But Miller wasn’t surprised to see the local community pioneer this program. Unlike larger cities that often have a variety of extensive public transportation options, midsize cities like Pittsburgh have become more dominated by cars, giving local governments more urgency in connecting residents to alternative choices.
“It’s really forced a lot of cities and transit agencies in these types of midsize cities to think really creatively about how they can improve their services, and how they can be really thoughtful and creative about shifting trips to more sustainable options,” Miller said.
There are unique technical considerations as Mobility as a Service becomes widespread. A growing standard used in the field is the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), which several public transportation options, including Port Authority, have adopted as a way to share information with navigation apps like Transit or Google Maps. Meanwhile, many bikeshare companies use General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) while ride-hailing and taxi companies use General On-Demand Feed Specification (GOFS).
These differences aren’t a problem, Miller said: “Because each mode of transportation has different needs, it makes total sense that there would be different data standards for transit, scooters/bikeshare, and on-demand services.”
“Ultimately, all of these mobility pieces should be able to speak the same language and connect together so people can easily make these trips.”STEPHEN MILLER, TRANSIT
But there’s a challenge in making sure these standards are adopted broadly within the transportation field.
“Ultimately, all of these mobility pieces should be able to speak the same language and connect together so people can easily make these trips,” he said.
Beyond making transportation more accessible to residents, Mobility as a Service has the potential to significantly reduce emissions — a critical and persistent issue for Pittsburgh, which the American Lung Association recently ranked as the ninth worst city in the country for air quality.
Part of those pollution issues are undoubtedly associated with the heavy use of cars here. A September 2019 report from mobility analytics company INRIX showed that 23% of car trips in Pittsburgh were less than one mile, while 50% were less than three miles.
Miller sees Move PGH and future work in Mobility as a Service as a way of resolving that classic last-mile problem in transportation.
“Those are distances that are easily covered by either walking or biking or electric scooters or public transit,” he said. “And so making sure that we build up these options and make them easy enough to access for people so they’re not just grabbing the car keys to go a mile down the road is really important to shifting those trips to more sustainable modes.”

In urban areas, both big and small, parking systems are a headache for both commuters and city governments. Most resident parking, pay, and display systems are either overcrowded or not adequately located. One of the best ways to tackle both these issues is by using park and ride systems in urban areas.
What Are “Park and Ride” systems?
Thousands of residents use private transport to travel to work, make grocery runs, or catch up with friends. All these activities are necessary but end up crowding the roads, mainly if everyone uses a separate car. While carpooling is a viable solution, it won’t work entirely if different people have the same route but various destinations in mind.
That is where a system like Park and Ride systems can reduce the number of vehicles on the road. Under Park and Ride systems, commuters park their private cars in designated parking spots, which are well connected with public transport hubs. They then use public transportation to cover the remaining distance to their destination.
This intermodal parking and transport system is already being practiced in thousands of cities in various countries. In places where “Park and Ride” has been systematically implemented, it has helped reduce traffic congestions, thus improving public transport usage and better organizing parking systems.
Advantages of Park and Ride systems
Some salient features of every park and ride system are as follows.
Park and ride systems improve urban mobility to a large extent. As several private vehicles are not used simultaneously, traffic congestion reduces, which in turn, reduces commute time. The system also encourages public transport usage and generates more revenue for city governments.Carpooling, an effective way to reduce both pollution and traffic congestion in urban areas, becomes the most popular when well-planned park and ride locations are introduced throughout a city. As people do not have to struggle with finding a fellow rider the whole way to a destination, they also embrace traveling with a friend or a family member more readily.Even people from suburban areas benefit from a park and ride system as residents traveling to the city center need not waste fuel commuting hundreds of miles each day. They can instead drive to a park and ride lot and use public transit from there to enter the city. This advantage, however, is apparent only when the park and ride lots are also situated on the outskirts of a town.
Any park and ride location is best when located away from sites of heavy congestion. While easily accessible, these areas should not be located very close to places that remain heavily crowded, especially during peak hours. These locations should also be well connected with public transport networks so that they are incentivizing enough for all commuters. Once a municipality decides to construct a park and ride lot, steps must be taken for proper implementation and maintenance. It must be kept clean and should not be overly expensive.
Considering the host of advantages this system offers and the relatively small investment, it demands, park and ride lots are a future-proof way of reducing traffic congestion in urban areas. They also make cities more pleasant for both commuters and tourists, and when planned carefully, they have very few downsides. For cities looking to turn smart, park and ride is a must-adopt system.

Autonomous cars have been in the works for many years. They hold promise for the future as efficient methods of transportation, however, the main setback is safety. To get autonomous vehicles into the public sphere, manufacturers need to ensure that they are not only just as safe as standard vehicles but a step above that safety level.
Now, through the use of artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous vehicles are getting the improvements they need.
AI for Vehicle Safety
According to a Stanford study from 2013, roughly 90% of vehicle crashes are due to human error, at least in part. The idea for a solution, then, is to remove the possibility for human error by automating vehicles to operate on their own. That way, the vehicle can drive smoothly and keep the driver, other drivers and pedestrians safe.
Of course, before you can operate an autonomous vehicle, they must have the highest safety standards as well. Detection systems offer the first steps of a solution. Sensors and cameras on autonomous cars can monitor and detect where other vehicles and pedestrians are in proximity to the car. Still, these vehicles need more than standard detectors.
AI is now improving up the foundation of these safety systems. Artificial intelligence algorithms consistently learn from past experience, whether they were successes or failures. Then, when the system finds itself in similar situations, it can act accordingly.
As more and more AI-enabled vehicles start coming into play, they can all be continuously learning, reducing vehicle crashes that come from human error.
New Models Using AI
With AI’s powerful evolving nature, researchers and car manufacturers are working on new vehicle models that integrate the latest technology for safety. Notably, a team of researchers at the Technical University of Munich are working on perfecting an AI safety detection system. This system will notify drivers seven seconds in advance that they must retake control over the wheel.
The AI system learns from the driver’s past behavior. For instance, whenever you have retaken the wheel in the past is a data point that the system will learn from. Then, when it recognizes similar situations while you’re driving, it can notify you seven seconds in advance that you should start steering again.
Researchers working on the project state that they need more data for this breakthrough to become widely used. However, they also state that, from the study trials, the system is 85% accurate with its predictions and notifications.
As this technology becomes more widely available, it can help distracted drivers, alerting them away from the distraction and back on the road. Thus, AI will ultimately be reducing car crashes through its integration with autonomous cars.
Future Improvements
Some autonomous vehicles are already using AI to operate. While not entirely self-driving, Tesla models, for instance, have an autopilot function that assists drivers on the road. Newer vehicles are taking this integration a step further, too.
The electric LF-Z model from Lexus uses AI to help drivers get around, keeping them safe in the process. The car enables AI-generated dialogue to communicate with the driver about routes, traffic and safety. The system also continuously learns from the driver’s habits and behaviors to assist them further.
A model like this one, combined with the AI breakthrough from Germany could be a big step forward. It could be something you see on the roads in the next few years.
You may also see some 5G-enabled vehicles soon, too. These vehicles, using AI, can help speed up data transmission on the road. That way, your vehicle could communicate with others, constantly learning to keep everyone safe.
A New Autonomous Direction
With the breakthrough at the Technical University of Munich and the newer smart car models coming into play, autonomous vehicles are taking on a refreshed direction. Their path is gaining more and more support, safety and practically with each new innovation. Now, the future is becoming more clear — AI in autonomous cars is a game-changer.

In many ways, trucks are a more viable focal point for the development of the artificial intelligence (AI) for fully-autonomous driving.
The global trucking industry is worth $700 billion annually, and trucking is the number one occupation in no less than 29 U.S. states. In addition, the sector has emerged as the key battleground in the development of automated driving.
The efforts of tech engineers had focused on the quest to build commercially-viable driverless automobiles, but in the last year there has been a shift toward the commercial vehicle sector. This shift can be seen in several key partnerships that have been signed between tech startups and the world’s largest truck manufacturers.
Waymo, often seen as the leader in driverless technology, has partnered with Daimler, the biggest truck manufacturer in the world. Meanwhile, TuSimple is teaming up with Traton, a subsidiary of Volvo, and Aurora — which is backed by Amazon and has recently acquired all of Uber’s self-driving tech — has joined forces with Volvo and Paccar. 
In many ways, trucks are a more viable focal point for the development of the artificial intelligence (AI) for fully-autonomous driving. Long haul vehicles travel on long, monotonous highways, whereas the urban mobility navigated by automobiles and robotaxis is more complex.
The difficulty with developing the AI, centers around what engineers refer to as “edge cases” – those unique scenarios that are rarely encountered in your average vehicle journey. Put simply, there are more edge cases for the AI to deal with in complex urban environments.
Could the trucking industry reap the benefits of autonomy ahead of other vehicle sectors?
Cost savings with AT
There is a strong commercial case for greater investment in AT. One factor is the current limitation on human driver hours for safety reasons, which limits journeys to eleven hours. With autonomous trucking, the vehicle could be on the road for longer periods. It’s estimated that a trip from New York to L.A. could be cut from five days to two, resulting in significant cost savings.
AT is also being touted as a possible solution to the shortage of truck drivers. Although two-thirds of all U.S. consumer goods are transported by trucks, the American Trucking Association (ATA) predicts the driver shortage will reach 160,000 by 2028. By investing in greater levels of autonomy, the industry can solve the driver shortage while continuing to meet growing demand for deliveries.
According to advocates of AT, AI-based cruise control will save up to 10% in fuel costs. The optimized driving judgement of the AI can yield other savings, from reduced tire and brake wear to lower maintenance and insurance costs.  The process of optimizing journeys will make further improvements as the AT will gather data from journeys and use this to enhance fuel efficiency.
How exactly will AT work? Rather than automating the entire journey, the current plan is for a hub-to-hub approach. This means the autonomous, or semi-autonomous, heavy goods vehicle would transport goods from one depot to another, along a relatively straightforward route. The more complex last mile of the delivery would then be performed by a human driver.
A common approach to the development of AT is the development of a computer ‘driver’. This can be retrofitted to an existing vehicle, rather than having to develop an entirely new vehicle from scratch. For example, autonomous start up Aurora – which has agreed to partnerships with Volvo and Paccar – has been developing a one-size-fits all system that can be installed on any vehicle.
The importance of conventional components
Vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have always demanded high quality components. These vehicles must travel immense distances in all manner of weather conditions, placing significant demands on steering and suspension parts.
To be ready for the AT future, component manufacturers may need to raise their game. According to 2019 data from the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, 538 out-of-service (OOS) violations were discovered during vehicle checks, in addition to a further 1,000 non-OOS violations. Problems included suspension defects or steering-related problems. The most common steering-related defects were when components were found to be worn, welded or even missing.  
Although relatively rare, reducing the risk of component defects is of growing importance, as AT must demonstrate the highest levels of reliability and safety to become commercially viable.
It is not enough to demonstrate that an autonomous vehicle is as safe as a human driver, as can be seen from some of the high-profile accidents that have undermined efforts to develop driverless tech in other vehicle sectors. Whether we are talking about a steering universal joint or steering columns, opting for high quality parts helps reduce the risks of defects.
A decade ago, few would have predicted that long haul trucking would have been the focal point of new autonomous driving technologies. Now, the sector looks like it will reap the benefits of autonomy ahead of other vehicle sectors. Although the main focus will be on software development and testing of AI, parts suppliers also need to contribute by making sure their components will meet the unique challenges these vehicles will face.

Maintenance costs are among the highest operational costs for fleets, behind only fuel and truck payments when it comes to vehicle-based costs, according to the American Transportation Research Institute’s most recent Operational Costs of Trucking report.
One way to help control maintenance costs is for fleets to mitigate the chances of unscheduled roadside maintenance. As reported earlier this month, the American Trucking Associations’ Technology and Maintenance Council found the average distance driven between unscheduled roadside repairs fell nearly 19% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Marco Encinas, director of product management for fleet telematics provider Teletrac Navman, said fleets can use their existing telematics systems to help keep unscheduled maintenance in check.
He noted that the rise in unscheduled maintenance had a lot to do with the high freight demand during the pandemic, along with the current ongoing parts shortage.
“The one thing that we did see was a huge increase in vehicles, specifically OTR vehicles, during the COVID pandemic,” Encinas said. “Everybody was home, but the transportation industry was busier than ever. They had to keep trucks running as much as possible. It seems like some of the operators let some of that normal maintenance behavior sort of lax in order to get productivity out of their trucks and keep them on the road.”
On a day-to-day basis, Encinas said fleets should make sure their truck drivers are conducting required pre-and post-trip inspections each day, and help drivers better understand what to look for.
“It helps you schedule your maintenance for things that won’t take you off the road immediately, but you definitely have to get addressed sooner rather than later,” he said.
Utilizing tools from telematics service providers can also help drivers, as they allow fleets to customize a checklist of things to go over in addition to their normal inspections.
“When you do those pre-trip and post-trip inspections and actually do the work…that will get you ahead of any kind of maintenance issues and put you in the preventive maintenance mode rather than reactive,” Encinas said. “Then you can selectively take the truck off the road to get stuff done when it’s not necessarily scheduled to be earning any revenue.”
Encinas noted that Teletrac Navman’s system has a maintenance module that allows fleets to schedule routine maintenance for equipment based on miles driven that will alert the driver and maintenance department when the truck needs service.
Another usage case for telematics is keeping track of maintenance costs for each piece of equipment a fleet operates.
“It also helps you keep control of your costs and account for the costs that are going into maintaining your vehicles,” he said. “So, one thing is to do the daily maintenance and preventive maintenance of your vehicles to keep them on the road, but the other piece is now you can start looking at are you putting in more money into these vehicles in yearly maintenance than they’re generating? Maybe it’s time to swap out your truck and get a new one.”
One thing Encinas said Teletrac Navman has been working on, and continues to work on, is incorporating maintenance and productivity data of trucks as they run to determine the best time to schedule them for maintenance.
“There’s things that we’re doing on the telematics side to add more intelligence rather than run static reporting and static alerts, but also put more intelligence into it and help you make better decisions about when to take that truck in and stay ahead of the preventive maintenance.”

 Air Methods, an air medical service provider, in the USA, has announced the launch of Spright, a newly formed drone solution designed to help improve healthcare access and minimize supply challenges. Collaborating with Wingcopter, Spright is creating a drone-based, healthcare-specific delivery network across the United States. As a result of the nation’s efforts to keep healthcare costs down, Americans are impacted by a lack of immediate or timely access to healthcare resources. When these shortages impact the availability of blood products, medicines, diagnostics or small medical devices, the consequences can be dire. 
The solution is a flexible, rapid distribution network designed with 21st-century technology. This new drone delivery network will improve access to urgently needed medical supplies for healthcare providers and the communities they serve. Air Methods will make this possible by deploying fleets of Wingcopter’s new flagship delivery drone, the Wingcopter 198. The team at Wingcopter has the proven technology and production capacity to enable Spright to create a nationwide network, built around Air Methods’ existing infrastructure of more than 300 bases, serving hundreds of hospitals, across 48 states in predominantly rural areas. 
“The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated some of the real challenges in our health care system creating an opportunity to find better solutions to extend access to healthcare, especially in rural America,” said JaeLynn Williams, CEO of Air Methods. “That is why we are doing what Air Methods’ does best, taking to the skies, using the latest in technology and drone innovation, delivering hope and facilitating healing with speed and efficiency that was previously unimaginable. We see Spright serving a vastly underserved market and playing a huge role in a future full of better outcomes for everyone.” This fall, Spright will be kicking off this endeavor by partnering with Hutchinson Regional Medical System, in Hutchinson, Kan., for the launch of an initial pilot project using Wingcopter’s delivery drones. This project will provide a proof of concept of how this new and exciting venture can provide needed relief and certainty for medical resources in rural America. Spright will provide additional details on this initial project as the deployment draws near. 
The Wingcopter 198 is an autonomous eVTOL delivery drone that enables safe, reliable, fast, and bi-directional medical deliveries. It is designed to provide maximum flexibility and ease of use in operations. The company’s patented tilt-rotor technology allows for vertical take-off and landing, while also enabling efficient forward flight over long ranges, thus eliminating the need for additional infrastructure. The drone has a range of up to 68 miles (110 kilometers), a maximum speed of 90 mph (145 kilometers per hour) and can carry a payload of up to 13 lbs. (6 kg). 
“We are thrilled to team up with Air Methods to create a life-saving drone delivery network throughout the United States,” said Tom Plümmer, Co-Founder and CEO of Wingcopter. “Our technology has been used globally to effectively deliver medical supplies, for example insulin in Ireland, children’s vaccines in Vanuatu, emergency medication in Malawi, and just recently, blood samples in Germany. Our vision to ‘save and improve lives’ resonates perfectly with Air Methods’ legacy of providing lifesaving care, combined with Spright’s ambition to improve the quality of healthcare across the U.S. by deploying fleets of Wingcopters, and we are excited about scaling this together.”

The time we live in, the present, is the most technically advanced it has ever been. With these new technologies come advancements in every business area, from customer-facing technologies to predictive inventory to transportation management.
Smart technology is transforming the way companies do business — including an impact on your company, whether you realize it or not. Businesses are very swiftly implementing AI and IoT to streamline operations and optimize data. This technology has already entered the forefront in major cities, and it’s quickly making its way into transportation management as well.
How will AI and IoT transform transportation management? And what does this mean for your business and clients?
What Are IoT and AI?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is when machines reflect a learning pattern to grow their knowledge through learning. These machines recognize patterns and collect data to analyze, predict, and track future changes. AI helps automate learning to make smarter, safer, faster decisions in businesses.
According to Stanford’s Artificial Intelligence and Life In 2030 — One Hundred Year Study, AI will have a massive impact on all forms of infrastructure. From city public transportation to rural sewage systems to transportation management, AI can collect and process data faster than humans can. This has a major impact on the way businesses understand data and create strategies.
IoT refers to the Internet of Things. This is basically the network of all devices that are connected to exchange data. Connected devices include vehicles, home appliances, electronics, shipping boxes, robots, and even credit cards, and many more. The limits for connectivity are endless. In fact, there are currently 17 billion connected devices, and it’s predicted that this will rise to 50 billion in the next two years.
IoT is the wave of the future with regards to transportation management. Analysts predict that 70–75% of new cars will feature IoT connectivity by 2022. And this is only with commercial use; in the shipping and logistics sector, connectivity could reach as high as 90%. This is because AI and IoT can optimize processes in ways that companies could never before have imagined.
How does it benefit us?
Autonomous Vehicles
Autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles have already driven onto the transport scene. Artificial intelligence enables trucks to sense their location and other objects around them to drive with appropriate speeds and directions. From Uber’s self-driving car to Tesla’s Semi, autonomous vehicles are quickly becoming the wave of the future.
Currently, self-driving cars aren’t fully autonomous. Rather, they function like “auto-pilot,” allowing drivers to sit in the passenger seat to do paperwork or sleep while the truck is driving itself. This lack of full-autonomy is largely to do with social and government pushback.
However, IoT is making it easier for self-driving vehicles to be fully autonomous through interconnectivity with warehouses, route planners, and delivery checkpoints. This will make these trucks safer and more efficient than even trained drivers themselves.
Moreover, connected robots and drones are quickly entering the scene as new methods of autonomous delivery. This will especially have an impact on last-mile logistics and eCommerce.
Streamlined Decision Making
IT experts say that connected or autonomous vehicles are attractive because of the technologies that reinforce them. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one part of the equation. The other part is artificial intelligence (AI). It acts as the driver, helping the connected ‘thing’ (could be a vehicle or inventory system) make smarter decisions.
As applied to transportation management, automated decision-making ability is crucial. Connected vehicles, shipments, and systems help with tracking and historical reporting. But real-time insights and responses take place through artificial Intelligence.
Strong Analytics
This tracking and reporting software doesn’t just allow companies to have a history of their trucks and shipments. Artificial intelligence can then analyze this data to create predictive forecasts.
This constant data analysis can help identify inefficiencies in planning, inventory, stocking, loading, unloading, and even among the workforce. It can then help create a strategy to create more efficient processes.
Warehouse Management
Artificial intelligence and IoT connected devices have already made their way into several warehouses, including Amazon’s e-commerce warehouses. For example, robot workers can pick faster and follow high levels of quality control.
RFID tags are also changing the inventory game. RFID tags are connected to the cloud and share data on a given package or pallet location. This means the staff doesn’t need to scan every item for inventory or delivery. They can load and unload the containers, and the RFID automatically updates the inventory in real-time.
This saves significant time and money while improving the accuracy of stock-keeping. In fact, RFID tags can maintain 95% accurate inventory, while the average inventory rate floats around 65%. Because of these numbers, nearly 96% of major retailers are planning on adopting RFID tech tags.

Streamlined Process
AI studies multiple factors at once, while IoT connects everything at once. This creates a holistic analysis of all areas of transportation management.
Together, AI and IoT can look at the warehouse floor temperature, inventory, safety, and equipment performance. They can link warehousing with loading procedures, where sensors can determine the utilization rate of trucks. This can then be linked to transport, where semi-autonomous trucks provide ongoing updates about location and safety.
Then, AI can determine the speed of unloading and last-mile delivery.
This links together to optimize routing and planning. AI and IoT can analyze multiple facets of data to make processes more efficient from A to Z.
Slashed Costs
All of these benefits together can help minimize costs. AI and IoT reduce inefficiencies that throw money out the window. They can also help reduce:
• Gas costs by avoiding traffic or stalling.• Insurance costs by making trucking safer.• Salaries, since drivers can do work and sleep while on the road.• Replacement costs because IoT can quickly alert to maintenance issues.
Reduced costs mean a stronger bottom line for retailers and transport companies alike.
Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things disrupt logistics and transportation management by making logistics operations smarter day by day. It is expected that delays in pickups/deliveries and trucking capacity concerns will be a matter of the past when AI and IoT come into the picture.
IoT and AI are the technologies of the future and expanding at a speed like never before. Every business, small scale, or larger enterprises will greatly impact these smart technologies.

A COMMON perception is that time wasted due to being stuck in traffic, or when trying to find a parking space, could have been saved if your car was a fully self-driving (FSD) vehicle.
We have been waiting for autonomous vehicles (AVs) for quite some time after all the statements made by companies involved in AV production.
The truth is, the perception about wasted minutes is wrong.
AV will still take time as it follows the best route possible to get to your destination, just like what you do by following the best route selection guide from Waze or Google Map.
The only difference is that in AVs, you need not focus on driving. You can do other things like attending to Facebook and Instagram, reading your paperwork, watching YouTube or movies, or simply sleeping until you reach your destination.
According to the Society of Automotive Engineers, to operate a FSD vehicle, not only do the autonomous cars need to communicate with the infrastructure and other cars around them, they should also fully understand their surroundings.
To ensure safety, AVs must understand and react to situations based on traffic cultures, which vary from one place to another.
For example, in rules and regulations, both written and non-written, which are widely accepted in society; the quality of education (what people learn as they grow up), including moral and ethical matters; how effective is enforcement (strictness of law); and finally, the road system design.
Autonomous cars are being tested around the world, but there have been a number of accidents, making the idea of training artificial intelligence (AI) the priority in understanding diverse situations and reactions.
By having a clear guide map, AVs can predict reactions and act on them, becoming an integrated part of the traffic system.
Tesla and its chief executive officer, Elon Musk, have long been criticised for overstating the capabilities of the company’s Autopilot system. Terms like “Autopilot” and FSD have contributed to an environment in which Tesla customers are misled into believing that their vehicles can actually drive themselves.
Due to the latest accidents involving Autopilot vehicles, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration now requires companies like Tesla and Alphabet’s Waymo to report incidents involving driver assistance and autonomous systems within one day of learning of a crash, signalling a tougher stance by regulators.
Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group that represents all the major automakers and their suppliers, excluding Tesla, released a statement that singled out “misuse and abuse” of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).
It said it is critical that consumers know and understand the benefits and limitations of these features to build and improve confidence in proven vehicle safety technologies.
Misuse and abuse of Level 2 ADAS systems is extremely dangerous and threatens consumer acceptance and confidence in vehicles equipped with potentially life-saving ADAS technologies.
Another trade group, the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, which represents AV companies, including Waymo, Argo, Aurora, Cruise and others, echoed similar concerns.
But they stated there must be a distinction between their members’ autonomous vehicles, which do not require human intervention to operate safely, and driver-assistance technology like Tesla’s, which requires an attentive driver.
Let us not forget that AVs still have a long way to go before they get there. Rules and regulations must be in place, infrastructure must be ready, even the weather conditions must be considered.
It is better to “assume the worst and design for that” and not rely on the technology promising safety. The question then is, who benefits the most from an AV?
With AVs, transport businesses no longer need to employ people to drive vehicles, thus saving tremendously on salaries, medical insurance and other costs. Thousands, even millions of drivers will be out of job as these companies maximise their profits.

For the giant tech companies, supplying AV software and hardware to auto makers means a new, huge revenue stream turning their multi-billion companies into trillion-dollar companies.
So it is clear that tech companies and companies in the transport business will gain the most from the AV industry.

By Shubhankar GautamParking problems don’t end with the search for a parking spot. The costs associated with traditional parking systems are too exorbitant for the average citizen, altogether discouraging people from automobile usage, who are now resorting to alternative modes of commuting such as public transport and privately-owned shared car services just so they could avoid paying high parking costs. Let’s find out whether low parking costs encourage automobile use.
The Hidden Cost of Parking
‘Parking pain’ is a real thing. This collective term is used to include all stresses related to parking costs because the problem is not as shallow as the apparent cost of parking but has deeper roots. For instance – It often happens that drivers find it difficult to determine the exact time for which they might need a parking spot and to avoid exorbitant fines associated with parking violations; they end up making an overpayment. Moreover, certain parking garages have a very rigid rate card structure wherein a driver is required to make a minimum one-hour payment even when he needs to use the garage for just half of its time – 30 minutes.
If this wasn’t bad enough already, there are even bigger surprises. Too often hidden costs are completely excluded from the picture. For instance – INRIX Research compiled the world’s largest parking database where nearly 6,000 drivers from 10 of the busiest US cities were surveyed. The purpose of the research was to reveal the ‘actual cost of parking’ for drivers, the cities and their economy.
The shocking results of the survey stated that on average, American motorists spend 17 hours per year in search of a legal parking spot and the cost wasted per driver is an estimated $345 in fuel, time, and carbon emissions. Further, the research found that among the 10 US cities surveyed, the worst plight was that of New York drivers. In the Big Apple, drivers spent a whopping 107 hours per year on an average in search of a parking spot and the amount wasted in time, fuel, and carbon emissions per driver was $2,243! Such numbers are not sustainable.
Add to the above-mentioned numbers the cost of parking itself and it becomes absolutely clear as to why motorists are discouraged from using automobiles. When it comes to the cost of parking and its correlation to automobile usage, one can safely apply the basic ‘law of demand’ which states that all factors remaining the same, the demand for a product or a service is inversely proportional to its price. Similarly, as the cost of parking reduces, people feel more encouraged to use their vehicles.
The root of the cost problem, when looked deeply, lies in inefficient and obsolete traditional parking systems that have contributed both directly and indirectly to a hike in parking prices. Directly by not streamlining the parking scenario in a manner that is cost-effective and indirectly by acting as a breeding ground for the above-mentioned wastage of time and fuel and increased vehicular emissions.
Hence, to effectively deal with the cost problem, outdated parking systems need to be done away with, allowing a new-age technology to take over.
Smart Parking Technology: The Cost-Effective Solution
Fortunately, with the emergence and growth of IoT-based smart parking technology, the ax can be laid at the root of the issue. Since it was uninformed drivers going around in circles hunting for a parking spot who ended up wasting time, money, and fuel; IoT-based smart sensors and cameras relay necessary parking data such as availability of a parking spot and its exact location to the driver in real-time and in combination with advanced reservation features, they aid in eliminating traffic congestion, reducing driver stress, and avoiding unnecessary wastage of time and fuel. Moreover, since the system is automated, a driver can pay exactly for the time he ends up using the parking garage, unlike traditional parking systems where he chooses an overpayment over a parking ticket.
Drivers can also receive alerts so as to avoid taking routes that are overcrowded and can stick to less-traffic lanes for a quicker and more reliable trip. Naturally, when traffic congestion reduces, so does the harmful carbon emissions responsible for damaging the environment.
Final Thought: Low parking costs
So we see that low parking costs do encourage greater automobile usage but it is the use of smart parking technology equipped to streamline the parking scenario that not only a fair parking pricing system can be set in place but also hidden costs associated with parking can be eliminated.

We live in an age where nearly everything we use is “smart.” Our devices have long had the capability to bring the data of the world to our fingertips. Still, now the smart capabilities have extended to once-mundane parts of our lifestyles like household appliances and modes of transportation. As such, it is not only our personal lifestyles that are becoming “smart,” but they are extending to affect our cities and our nations, developing into “smart cities.”
A smart city takes the idea of smart technology and expands it on a tremendous scale. The city will use technology and connectivity to provide services and solutions to address societal needs: improve social and economic welfare, reduce environmental pollution and waste, improve safety and security policies, and open these services and solutions to be inclusive to all.
Smart Mobility
Many smart city projects center around the topic of mobility and transportation. This makes sense as mobility is one area where most, if not all, people participate or need to participate in some way or form. There are many successful use cases where smart cities are implementing mobility projects, using machine learning and AI to analyze data patterns and improve life for their residents. For example, in 2012, Pittsburgh’s city implemented Surtrac, an intelligent traffic signaling system, reducing travel times and emissions by optimizing vehicles’ movement through intersections. Analysis of the project found that the average travel times reduced by 25%, and cars spent up to 40% less time idling. This affected not only citizens’ quality of life but also the environment by reducing emissions.
This is just one example of how a smart city benefits its citizens. Still, smart cities are not just about how the city’s government officials can provide the infrastructure, services, and solutions to benefit its citizens. If that were the core point, it would simply be a digital city, not necessarily smart. A smart city’s very essence depends on its people to improve its services with gathered data, making it more efficient, more inclusive, and more secure.
Simply put, if the city’s residents do not participate or have the ability to participate, then the smart city is… at the end of the day, not so smart. While many cities are well on their way to planning their smart cities, when it comes to providing smart mobility and transportation systems to all, they forget about a key demographic: those with disabilities and mobility challenges.
Research shows that by 2050, 68% of the world’s population will likely live in urban areas, and of those people, roughly 15% will be those with disabilities: around 937.5 million people. Many people can relate to the benefits of living in an urban community: faster and often easier access to basic needs like healthcare, essential household needs, and transportation. However, for those with disabilities, getting from point A to point B is not as easy as it sounds.
Think of the different modes of transportation available: walking, biking, driving a personal vehicle, taxi, fixed-route transits (think subways or buses), ridesharing, carsharing. These methods are not necessarily easy or efficient for those with disabilities to utilize. With difficulty even finding a method of transportation, it’s said that 28% of those with disabilities rarely even leave their homes.
I mentioned earlier that if a city’s residents do not or cannot participate in the smart city, they are not actually becoming “smarter” because it is not fully meeting its goal. This is exemplified perfectly when it comes to the lack of smart mobility solutions accessible to those with disabilities. To get back on track of becoming a smart city, mobility and related infrastructure need to be barrier-free. Barrier-free refers to designing infrastructure and services that are inclusive to all, including those with physical or other disabilities.
Some critics may say that barrier-free mobility is already available. After all, we call “paratransit” or DRT (Demand Responsive Transport) services available for those who may need extra assistance in many metropolitan areas. However, I would argue that this is a grey area where many may fall prone to believing that this is an easy fix. While paratransit does offer more accessibility to people with disabilities, they’re often at a high cost with limited service (availability of vehicles, operational hours, distance, etc.).
On average, door-to-door paratransit service costs between $45 and $50, increasing with longer distances and time. This is not something that many with disabilities can afford regularly. Paratransit and DRT also depend on the vehicle to arrive at a specific time, and with issues like traffic or weather conditions, there can be delays or even no-shows. While being unable to catch a cab might not seem like an issue for many, for those with disabilities, it can be the difference between making it to a crucial health appointment or their work, a line of financial stability.
Short-term: Start with Utilizing Machine Learning and AI
While there’s no panacea to solving today’s mobility issues – that’s not to say that there are no ways to begin to implement changes to make mobility more accessible, inclusive, and barrier-free. We can ensure that DRTs can become more accessible to ensure that the operations are being optimized to reduce costs, lessen wait times, and increase dispatch capabilities to ensure that passengers can find rides when they need them.
This is where the core theme of the smart city comes in. By collecting data and utilizing machine learning technology, DRT services can utilize fleet management systems to dispatch drivers to passengers, reducing idle wait times for both parties. A smart dispatch feature within the fleet management system can also consider traffic conditions and real-time driver availability and location to more accurately predict arrival times, ensuring that there are fewer mix-ups and delays for both the driver and passenger.
Utilizing a fleet management platform will allow DRT and paratransit services to continue to operate at reduced costs. As the service becomes increasingly optimized, the services can expand the operation areas to allow more vehicles and more passengers to become a part of the service. There are numerous other ways that data and machine learning can allow seamless barrier-free mobility services, but it shouldn’t end there.
Long-Term: Expand Barrier-Free Mobility Into Other Infrastructure and Policy
When the goal is to ensure inclusion, a smart city’s solution to accessible mobility can’t just end at paratransit and DRT services. Accessibility and inclusivity need to expand to other modes of transportation, allowing for a more diverse experience and economic relief.
Thankfully, there are cities and organizations that are considering this challenge as they plan their infrastructure and services. For example, in 2020, Google Maps rolled out a new feature showing wheelchair-friendly routes, also adding on a feature where anyone can contribute accessibility information to the application.
Going further, with headlines of autonomous and connected vehicles beginning to hit the roads, we can also consider how autonomous driving technology can bring more inclusivity into mobility. Although the technology for fully autonomous vehicles is still in development, there are other developments underway. In 2016, the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research developed a self-driving wheelchair to navigate Singapore’s Changi General Hospital. And more recently, WHILL, a “personal EV” company, announced that it would be providing self-driving wheelchairs at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan. Perhaps one day, this can also translate into autonomous passenger vehicles geared towards aiding those with disabilities.
In the meantime, the barrier-free mindset needs to become a part of policy development. While there may be overarching regulations stating that accessibility is a must for public infrastructure, with the digital and connected infrastructure development changes, accessibility isn’t often considered when planning to change over to a smart city structure. Research labs, organizations, and companies can do their part to bring inclusivity to the forefront of these technological advances. Still, it can go even faster with policy on our side.
Conclusion
Having inclusive smart cities should be synonymous with providing accessible mobility to all. It’s not only essential to fulfilling the other goals of having safety and security, social and economic wellness, and contributing to a greener world; it is a basic human right to be mobile and be able to experience economic benefits and a sustainable, active standard of life. While it may take time and purposeful planning, to become a smart city and even a smart world––we have to put people first. The city will follow.

Last week, the Seoul Metropolitan Government announced that its city-wide public IoT network (Internet of Things) is on track to be completed by 2023, reported Korea Biz Wire. The operating platform is planned to be established at City Hall by the end of 2021.
The public IoT network aims to support and provide public services such as shared parking, smart street lights, and disappearance prevention through the use of IoT sensors.
The government will collect data related to traffic, safety, and the environment using these IoT sensors while enabling such data to be transmitted mutually to and from 25 district offices in the city.
Public IoT network based on LoRa
The LoRa-based trunk network will span 421 kilometers long, and be deployed across Seoul by the end of 2021. 
LoRa (long-range) is a low-power wireless telecommunication technology that connects sensors to the cloud. Based on the LoRaWAN® standard, it is capable of enabling real-time data and analytics communications. 
LoRa enables smart IoT solutions for low-powered devices and is used in energy management, natural resource reduction, pollution control, infrastructure efficiency, disaster prevention, and more.
As many as 1,000 IoT-exclusive LoRa base stations will be installed in public buildings such as community centers.
Of these, 195 are slated to be installed in the districts of Eunpyeong, Guro, and Seocho. These cities are currently carrying out pilot tests, whereas the other LoRa stations will be split across 19 district offices in 2022, and three district offices in 2023.
Public IoT network part of Seoul’s Smart City plans
These efforts to establish a city-wide IoT network are part of the Seoul government’s 102.7 billion won (US$ 85.8 million) investment into establishing a “Smart Seoul Network” (S-Net).
Unveiled in 2019, the plan was expected to unfold over three years. The government is addressing pain points in the city such as widely available, free public Wi-Fi (on the Wi-Fi 6 standard) covering 4,237 kilometers, with a priority on installation in densely-populated regions.
By 2022, they intend to increase the number of public Wi-Fi access points (APs) by over 200%. With over 6 million residents, the costs savings are expected to be immense. 
On a per-resident basis, the annual communications cost savings are projected to come up to 630,000 won (US$ 527) upon completion of the project. Annually, total savings in communications costs are expected to be around 3.88 trillion won (US$ 3.25 billion). 
Korea’s 5G to support its IoT efforts
Seoul’s IoT efforts seem right on time, as South Korea has established itself as an APAC leader in 5G deployment.
5G technology will be the key to help realize the full potential of IoT, as it promises high data rates, ultra-reliable transmission, and extremely low latencies. 
This is especially pertinent when it comes to Industrial 5G, which will improve efficiencies and flexibilities for industrial players, as well as critical industries.
South Korea an APAC leader in Smart City development
In 2020, Seoul launched the country’s first blockchain-based digital driver ID, with over a million drivers eagerly signing up for the service. 
Other than Seoul, South Korea has embarked on several other Smart City initiatives, with the most recent being the use of a decentralized identity system based on blockchain for citizen identity management in the city of Busan.
As part of Korea’s smart city strategy, the government has embarked on appointing special zones that have been strongly deregulated in the pursuit of various technological testing.
Busan’s blockchain zone is the latest in a series of “regulation-free zones” designated by the government in order to experiment with varying technologies and innovations. 
Six other zones have been established in various parts of the country. 
They include Gangwon-do (digital healthcare); Daegu City (smart wellness); Sejong City (autonomous driving); Jeollanam-do (e-mobility); Chungcheongbuk-do (smart safety control), and Gyeongsangnam-do (advanced battery recycling).

By strategically incorporating various mobility services, The COMET seamlessly addresses unmet needs of the community by providing specialized services for niche groups previously underserved by traditional fixed route and paratransit services. 
By Megan Perrero
When John Andoh* was hired as CEO and executive director of the Central Midlands Regional Transit Authority (The COMET), (CANADA) in 2018, the board said the system had become stagnant; ridership had started to plateau and there were several unmet needs regarding service offerings. So, Andoh set out to find innovative ways to integrate different mobility options to address food deserts, expand nighttime transit hours, connect people to employment centers, provide first-and-last-mile connections and expand service options for seniors and people with disabilities. 
“That was the catalyst of what got us to start looking at how we could be more of a mobility manager,” said Andoh. 
In about three years, The COMET has addressed all these unmet needs by introducing new mobility options, implementing technology upgrades, pursuing discretionary funding and leveraging partnerships. The COMET can now seamlessly provide specialized trips for niche groups previously underserved by the traditional fixed route and paratransit system by integrating these various mobility services. 
COMET on the GO with TNC Partnerships  
Andoh explains the frequency and layout of The COMET’s system created gaps in nighttime service and was “just not connecting people effectively to grocery stores.”  
Instead of accepting the status quo, Andoh began brainstorming of something that would be a low-cost solution and easy to get off the ground quickly. The answer? Establishing a partnership with Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) Uber and Lyft to offer a new mobility service, COMET on the Go!  
“We went one step further and came up with a creative idea that nobody [was] really thinking about before,” Andoh said.  
While TNC partnerships primarily focus on first-and-last-mile connections, this program is unique in that it addresses nighttime service gaps with COMET @ Night and food equity with COMET to the Market. To do this, the agency partnered with Uber and Lyft in January 2019 to subsidize rideshare trips that started by providing promotional codes for $5.00 discounts that increased to $8.00 in January 2021. Both services run seven days a week, with the nighttime service operating from 9:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. and the grocery service operating from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. The services integrate with Catch The COMET and Transit mobile apps. 
To better address food equity, COMET to the Market solely provides rideshare trips to grocery stores for people who live in food deserts as designated by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, improving food equity by removing barriers to people getting to grocery stores on a regular basis. The agency identified every grocery store with meat and produce in the area, so people can choose where they shop instead of limiting them to their neighborhood store.  
Pre-pandemic, ridership was growing, “and that was our mechanism of success—that we are truly helping connect people to grocery stores,” Andoh said.  
Another success to come from these TNC partnerships, specifically with the night program, is the cost savings. Instead of seeing TNCs as competitors, Andoh explains The COMET views TNCs as complementary to transit since it is more cost-effective for them to use cars for door-to-door trips versus running a network of buses carrying less than 1.5 passengers per hour.  
“Launching these programs allowed us to demonstrate that we are returning value to the penny sales tax [which was approved by voters in 2012],” Andoh said.   
Blue Bike Comes to Downtown  
Since The COMET’s TNC partnerships focus on other types of trips, the agency has leveraged bikeshare to bridge first-and-last-mile connections in the downtown area. Blue Bike, launched in January 2019, is owned by the city of Columbia, S.C., contracted to Bewegen and operated and maintained by the agency. The vision for the service was to be “truly integrated” into the rest of the system and not just a “standalone service,” explains Andoh. 
Riders have access to 18 stations throughout downtown Columbia and can purchase passes via the six kiosks throughout the bikeshare system using credit, debit and Visa or MasterCard gift cards or riders can also use their COMET Card or the Blue Bike mobile app. These options ensure accessibility for all by catering to people who don’t have a debit or credit card, or access to a smartphone. As a bonus, COMET users can get free, unlimited 45-minute rides.  
“We treat Blue Bike almost like a bus route because you can just tap your COMET Card on the kiosk and get that free bike,” Andoh said.  
Blue Bike is also integrated into all the platforms customers use to plan and pay for their trip, such as Catch The COMET App (Passport) that not only allows users to purchase bus fares, passes for paratransit, trip plan with real-time arrival information but also link to social media, Blue Bikes and the city. The COMET has also partnered with moovit and Transit to offer a Mobility-as-a-Service app, where passengers can check the status of Blue Bike stations, access real-time arrival information and purchase fares and passes. Real-time arrival information is provided via TransLoc. 
Vanpool Brings Transit to Employers 
The COMET’s Vanpool Program, operated by Enterprise, provides access to employment sites that are beyond the fixed-route transit system and allow commuters to set their desired commute, explains Andoh. However, the agency approached this service a bit differently than other vanpool programs.  
“We wanted Enterprise to go to employment sites that were not in the common fixed-route service area and sell the concept of transit to them, [saying] we’ll promote this van to your employees [and] we’ll pay that $500 towards the van. You help us in getting people to use the service,” Andoh said.  
This approach allows them to test the concept of transit and can be a potential catalyst to creating an express bus route if The COMET sees a large group of people regularly going to one employment site. Several employers have jumped at the opportunity of implementing a fixed bus route, such as Fort Jackson, McEntire Produce and Michelin.  
“Before, they had nothing,” Andoh said. “They didn’t know how to reach out to us on how to get something when the question was asked. And it also allowed them to reach out to people for job recruitment from areas where they couldn’t [before] because they [had] a lack of transportation.” 
Increased Access for Seniors and People with Disabilities 
Just as new services and technology is important, so is leveraging partnerships and grant funding explains Andoh, who tasked the agency’s grants and regional coordination manager to slow down their penny spending and explore other discretionary funds. Andoh adds the manager has been pretty successful in getting grant funding. One example is the Federal Transit Administration grant that was awarded for The COMET’s volunteer mileage reimbursement program and a subsidized transportation program.  
The agency partnered with Able South Carolina to launch the Volunteer Transportation Program (V-Trip) and the Taxi Voucher Pick Up Program (PUP) in January 2021 to provide better access to transportation for seniors and persons with disabilities underserved by the present transit system. V-Trip reimburses 57.5 cents per mile, up to 100 miles each month. PUP gives a $50 subsidy on taxi or ridershare (Uber and Lyft) trips each month. The services are operated 24 hours a day and are offered to people who live outside the agency’s service area, live in Richland or Lexington Counties and live inside the Columbia urbanized area.  
Another discretionary grant awarded to The COMET in partnership with Foenix Mobility is the Innovative Coordinated Access and Mobility (ICAM) Grant, which will increase access to healthcare services for residents.  
“We’re going to be utilizing their technology to connect seniors, persons with disabilities and low-income folks to healthcare in a more seamless manner,” Andoh said. “Foenix Mobility is also putting together an app to help people who need access to the pharmacy or medical or dental appointment [to] match them to whatever available transportation option is available to them.” 
In addition to more specialized services and mobile app, The COMET is also updating its technology offerings for its paratransit service. The agency has been working with TripSpark to migrate to its Passenger Portal that integrates with Trapeze PASS to provide notifications and allow customers to reserve and cancel their paratransit trips. 
Niche Services Boost Public’s Perception of Transit 
By tailoring services to niche demographics and providing user-friendly technology to access them, the agency is able to not only provide a more efficient, individualized service but also attract riders who may not ride a fixed busroute, but would use Comet @ Night to get home after dinner. And this has helped the public change its perception of what public transit can do. By being active in the community, Andoh describes how people are seeing the agency in a new light and as a way to enrich lives of residents.  
“People are starting to see The COMET as progressive and see it as valuable in offering mobility options in moving people from A to B versus this public service tax subsidy that’s not providing any value,” Andoh said. “People are seeing The COMET is truly a good community partner. If there’s an idea [that’s] pitched to me, we will try to find a way to make a transit component to it so that we can be a part of it.”

Technologies that give fleets a unified view of driver safety data can assist with proactive safety training.
Fact No. 1: Vast amounts of data are available to trucking companies. Besides getting real-time data from telematics, ELDs, dashboard cams and transportation management software (TMS) components, companies gather data from insurance providers and public databases that include motor vehicle records, VIN records and federal safety collections.
Fact No. 2: The transportation industry is placing an ever-stronger emphasis on safety. Companies are prioritizing investments that can improve driver training, avert nuclear verdicts, mitigate risks and manage insurance premiums.
Let’s bring these two facts together by suggesting ways that data can and should be used to address safety concerns.
Ideally, one platform could pull data from disparate sources and compile it into an easy-to-use mechanism like a driver scorecard. Otherwise, management teams are inefficiently stitching together data points and working with inconsistent formats and outputs, all of which makes forming predictions and correlations much harder to do.
Assuming you have a system like this in place or are moving toward it, let’s take a look at how unified data can help make you safer. The key is to leverage and analyze the data to pinpoint potential risks, and then respond to those risks with concrete actions to reduce the risk levels.
Preventive driver trainingData can be applied before and after accidents happen to provide extra training for the most at-risk drivers.
Post-accident training would obviously be based on whatever incident has occurred. The sooner the training happens after the accident, the better. Reinforcement or remediation of certain material can help prevent the inciting behavior and thus reduce future accidents. It can also be offered to insurers as good faith proof of efforts to mitigate future risk.
Proper review and follow-up are essential to make sure the offending behavior is being controlled by the driver. Compliant drivers – ones who observe the rules, and correct behaviors when they do start to develop bad habits – are safer drivers. Studies show that post-accident training reduces the driver behavior in question by up to 80% over the following year and a half.
Pre-accident training can be applied towards any area that your predictive data is indicating. It could drop incident rates by much as 30%. Examining the data will expose training opportunities up and down your organization.
For instance, is a driver lately recording more incidents of hard braking? Or is excessive speed up across the entire fleet? These data points will help you target your communications and training. Again, the process is much more manageable if you have a system in place to handle such workflows by identifying behaviors at a certain threshold, matching them with appropriate training modules, alerts and follow-ups.
You may also link accident prevention intelligence to specific routes. Data can tell you everything from what time of day a particular road is the safest or what section of a route experiences higher accident rates. The data can get surprisingly granular. Drivers can be notified accordingly, whether that is done manually through a dispatcher or via an automated workflow.
The results make these efforts well worth your time and energy. Better training creates more prepared drivers, which results in fewer accidents, less chance of nuclear verdicts, reduced risk and improved relations with insurers that hopefully will produce lower or more stable premiums.
Beefing up complianceNow that we’ve demonstrated how data can energize your safety program, let’s go a step further. A unified system and united data can aid in virtually every goal of your business, starting with compliance.
Let’s say the DOT pays a visit to you in Kansas City to perform an audit. However, your filing cabinets containing compliance paperwork are all in Dallas. While this sort of scenario is on the decline, it does exist.
Even if you’ve gone all digital with files, what happens if you have 50 locations nationwide and each location is a ‘silo’ that keeps its information separate and unintegrated? You will have problems with gathering, collating and presenting all of the data.
The right system will funnel all the relevant data into one vantage point and present it in an easily digestible format. Putting a system like this in place will help streamline and improve everything from troubleshooting in-the-minute operational issues to determining long-term strategy.
Fleet executives need to see how the data from all locations fits together to get a cohesive, overall view of the business. A real-time, bird’s-eye view of the corporate situation is an efficient vehicle for achieving control and visibility into all aspects of the organization.
Your data is what you make of it. A thoughtful and thorough approach to data management, usage and analysis ensures it will point the way forward to success in each area of your business.

If you think real estate is thrice obsessed with location (and it is), make room for geodata’s expanding role in payments, banking and a slew of related activities. The January 2021 Digital Consumer Onboarding Tracker® done in collaboration with Melissa informs on issues of the moment around how location data is making financial transactions safer and more accurate.
Saying location “is crucial to merchants, banks and service providers looking to reach customers in the digital age,” the Tracker adds that “maintaining accurate address information starts with onboarding and ends with ensuring that businesses have the most up-to-date information to tailor the final steps of delivery to their customers. Faulty data, on the other hand, can result in botched deliveries, inefficient operations and poor communication with customers.”
Faulty data. Sounds bad, but “terrible” may better describe it. “Failing to obtain accurate data and frustrating customers naturally leads to diminished sales. One study reported that 19 percent of failed deliveries are the result of erroneous address information. Such errors can cost companies hundreds of thousands of dollars annually, and large retailers report that annual charges can run into the millions if carriers must fix addresses to complete deliveries.”
Stakes are clearly high in the location accuracy game. The January 2021 Digital Consumer Onboarding Tracker® provides a focused view of how companies are getting it right.
Wherever You Go, There You Are
Geocoding relies on exact geophysical coordinates for a given address or location. Companies are using it more for logistical planning to fine-tune nettlesome “last mile” delivery snags for better customer experiences. Given the new prevalence of remote onboarding, collecting accurate address data is the point at which errors can begin, or be avoided entirely.
“Recent strides have been made in the use of geocoding technology, particularly in the financial and retail space. The precision and accuracy geocoding provides can open doors to even deeper insight when it comes to [firms’] customer data,” Bud Walker, chief strategy officer at Melissa, told PYMNTS.
Walker added, “Geocoding is useful for analytics: By plotting points on a map, businesses can identify segmentation patterns to more effectively target their customers. In addition, rooftop-level geocoding provides delivery-point accuracy. Giving retailers the ability to ‘put the pin’ in the customer’s driveway improves logistics and cuts down on shipping costs. Geocoding is also useful in risk assessment and fraud prevention. By developing purchasing behavior patterns, financial institutions can mitigate fraud by identifying unusual activity in a location that’s not typical of a specific customer.”
Address Verification Completes The Picture
Geocoding converts addresses to map points plus directions — indispensable in the delivery economy that’s grown exponentially since the pandemic hit. In new Tracker, Sunil Sharma, chief product and technology officer for Los Angeles-based online logistics marketplace Cargomatic, told PYMNTS, “Geocoding is a critical part of the plumbing, and final mile delivery would be incredibly hard to handle without it. Today’s shopper expects to know where their order is for every step of the shipment’s journey and expects proactive communication for any deviation.”
This comes in many forms, Sharma said, but location data has very precise applications.  “Optimizing routes with geocoding can stop a delivery from being missed or delayed by sending an 18-wheeler into a small neighborhood, for example. The technology is expected not only to improve the economics for all parties but also to reduce delivery networks’ carbon footprints.”
Precision, then, becomes the merchant’s friend and ally. And precision is badly needed.
As Melissa’s Bud Walker told PYMNTS, “Since address databases are often full of errors, it can be challenging to match this data with actual coordinates. That’s why it’s important to work with an address verification expert as part of [a firm’s] geocoding initiatives to properly parse, correct and verify the physical address data. Once [firms] have that foundation of complete and accurate data, valuable demographics such as household income, credit information and more can be added, giving [firms] the insight [needed] for customer profiling.”

By 2030, the world will see 41 million 5G-connected cars on the smart city roads. The prediction comes from the 5G in automotive and smart transportation application analysis report. This number will rise to a whopping 83 million by 2035. A three-quarter of these 5G-connected cars will be cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) equipped cars.
As per research, the 5G C-V2X cars will enhance road safety and improve the traffic ecosystem. Simultaneously, it will also reduce the use of fossil fuels by up to one-third. What’s more important?
The technology of sharing sensor data in these cars will focus on the protection of the vulnerable road users. These include pedestrians and cyclists. With 5G-based cellular connectivity in cars, experts also foresee the possibility of achieving the ‘vision of zero road traffic deaths.
But how exactly do these cars operate? Let us take a brief look. 
The Mechanism Of 5G-Enabled C-V2X Cars 
Cellular V2X is a global system of vehicle-to-everything communication. Its design intends to improve road safety and promote smart transportation such as automated driving. The concept is developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Organisation. 
The C-V2X uses 3GPP standardised 4G LTE or 5G mobile cellular connectivity. This helps it to send and receive signals from a vehicle to other vehicles, people and objects. In other words, it connects to other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and other fixed objects such as traffic lights in its vicinity. It works without network assistance and has a range of more than a mile.Advertisement
So, C-V2X establishes communication with moving objects on the road and the roadside infrastructure. This helps C-V2X-enabled cars to keep the focus on decreasing the number of fatal road accidents. And as this technology advances, it is anticipated to have expanded safety features.
Thanks to technology, it is gaining significant attention from almost every mobile operator and automobile industry giants. Some of the big names like Audi, BMW, Tesla and Toyota are teaming up to implement C-V2X trials for commercial deployment.
Potential Of 5G Technology In The Automated Vehicle Industry
Audi and Ericsson entered a partnership in 2018 with the aim to work on a series of 5G connected car initiatives. One of their first projects is a 5G-enabled automation application that focuses on personal safety.
Both Audi and Ericsson have been testing the use of 5G wireless network technology for the production of vehicles. Their partnership is showcasing the potential of wireless communication in production at an early stage. 
5G networks offer ultra-low latency which will act as the driving force that enables connected cars to progress exponentially. As per Marie Hogan, head of mobile broadband & IoT at Ericsson, 5G satisfies the performance requirements of industrial automation. 
Further, Hogan says that 5G combines all points in their production environment leading to enormous improvements in flexibility and connectivity. As a result, it “shows how humans and robots can work together safely.”
Therefore, this is the first time that highly advanced applications and system-critical IoT networking come together to offer greater flexibility, mobility and efficiency. This in terms of production automation.
Currently, the team is testing the potential of 5G technology for industrial application in the Audi Production Lab. These kinds of projects are intended to understand more about how wireless networks can be used optimally in a smart factory.  The statement comes from Dr Henning Löser, head of the Audi Production Lab.
The First Car To Hit The Roads Of China
Recently, China Telecom has announced the first production car in the world enabled with 5G technology. The car is named ‘HiPhi 1’ by HiPhi, a subsidiary brand of Human Horizons. The company is a part of the intelligent company’s “3 Smart” strategic blueprint. This includes smart vehicles, smart transportation and smart cities. 
The aim of Human Horizons is to develop smart transportation technologies that transform the meaning of human mobility. And this is to contribute to the advancement of smart cities. In partnership with China Telecom, the company will work on 5G technology research and implementation. The focus will be in the areas of the “3 Smart” strategic blueprint. 
Coming to HiPhi, the car will have the world’s first human-oriented architecture (HOA). The HOA is self-adaptive and learns to create diversified solutions to enhance user experience. 
It consists of a ‘neural network’ of four ‘super brain’ domain controllers and six microprocessing units (MPUS) connected by 1G Ethernet. The connectivity provides a higher communication rate than conventional area networks.
The car is capable of analysing massive amounts of data and making decisions. This is as per the claims of the partnership. To do so, the car will make use of cloud computing with a powerful data analysis engine. Altogether, this will give birth to a truly intelligent and smart vehicle. 
The HiPhi 1 will run on electricity with a 5G-V2X enabled communication network. It will feature more than five hundred sensors possessing the excellent capability to connect between cars, roads and cities.
As per reports, the automaker’s partnership with China Telecom is one-of-its-kind. This collaboration will help expedite the commercialisation of 5G in the automated vehicles industry. The commercial rollout of HiPhi 1 is expected from the beginning of 2021. 
The Roll Out Of HiCar 
Huawei’s 5G-based C-V2X HiCar technology is grabbing the attention of many automakers. The technology offers an interface to the car’s core operating system. Alongside, it also aids in connecting a car to everything – from moving to non-moving objects on the road.
It has the capability to connect to traffic lights, cameras and speed limit signals. 30 different auto brands will be using HiCar technology for the arriving models. Huawei has already signed up 18 automakers such as Audi and Toyota to use the technology.
However, the first one to showcase HiCar’s potential on the road will be BYD, China’s largest EV maker. BYD will be using HiCar in its upgraded Han flagship electric sedan. It’s car ‘Han EV’ will make its first appearance in June 2020.
The car will have a slight resemblance to Tesla Model 3 in China in terms of style and initial price (about $40,000). With the use of the latest lithium iron phosphate batteries in multiple pack sizes, the Han EV will traverse up to 375 miles. It reaches a speed of 60 mph in less than 4 seconds.
Among Chinese battery makers, BYD stands in second place with 10.76 GWh capacity, after battery giant CATL. As the company claims, its blade-shaped design enhances space utilisation by over 50% than other pack layouts. And the design is safer than other competitors. 
Why Will 5G Cars First Appear On Chinese Roads?
China has already completed deployment of almost 200,000 5G base stations across the nation. By the end of 2020, the country will have 500,000 5G base stations deployed. The report is as per the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China. 
The number of 5G base stations is increasing in China. Evidently, China is on the way to becoming the first country to have C-V2X deployed. The rapidly increasing installation of 5G networks will play a huge role in expanding the C-V2X market size.
Not just in China, but other parts of the world as well. We may see it by the first quarter of 2021.

AI-driven capabilities have catapulted route planning optimization technology forward. While AI will drive the future of trucking, it’s also driving the present with optimization technology.
The global pandemic has paused or inhibited momentum for a number of industries, but not the trucking industry.
The economy relies heavily on drivers and fleets. Although it faces various obstacles — including increased demand and fewer drivers to meet it – the trucking industry continues to see significant growth.
According to the American Trucking Association, the trucking industry was short roughly 60,800 drivers back in 2018, and the shortage has continued. Experts estimate 80,000 fewer available drivers on the roads in 2021 vs. a year ago. A combined higher demand and lack of qualified drivers requires fleets to accelerate their digital transformation efforts to keep pace.
More fleets than ever before are leveraging cloud-based software and data to decrease planning time and optimize workflows. Fleet management software platforms enable fleets to do more with less and increase driver efficiency, which helps drivers complete more stops and thrive in a supportive work environment.
What specific capabilities have fleets invested in to rise above the competition, improve decision-making and meet demand?
Route optimization technologyAI-driven capabilities have catapulted route planning optimization technology forward. While AI will drive the future of trucking, it’s also driving the present with optimization technology. 
This technology automates driver plans to set both fleets and drivers up for success. By taking data and constantly-changing variables like weather and construction into account, planners can assign drivers to routes that save time and reduce missed deliveries. AI has raised the industry standard for efficient route planning, and trucking has recognized the value of automated route optimization technology. Automation capabilities will continue to evolve and advance transportation management processes.
Drivers, as well as fleets, benefit from route optimization. AI-based software will increasingly enhance the driver experience by more effectively utilizing their skillsets.
Eventually, route optimization software will start taking additional driver variables into account, such as their experience levels and preferences. For instance, fleets could create smoother, more efficient dispatching and driver training processes by automatically assigning new drivers to easier routes.
Driver workflow softwareThe buzz around “workflow” is well-deserved these days. Drivers can use trip and location-enabled apps to access the digital forms they need for each stop and customer, saving time by reducing paperwork and bypassing unnecessary steps that, in the past, had caused manual-based errors.
Driver workflow solutions increase fleet flexibility.
With more advanced driver workflow software, each trucking company can customize their workflow steps and forms for drivers to suit their specific needs. These flexible forms and workflows improve the overall driver experience, which could lead to increased driver retention in the midst of a serious shortage. These solutions also boost productivity for all users: managers, dispatchers, planners, and drivers alike.
Driver workflow solutions also streamline communication.
Managers and drivers who use workflow software can communicate more easily via real-time data visibility, constant ETA updates and in-app messaging tools. Enhanced communication ensures operational efficiency and data integrity – critical for fleet managers and planners.
Driver workflow solutions streamline onboarding.
With fleets trying to meet constant demand, they’re always seeking ways to streamline the driver hiring and training process. Driver workflow technology eliminates those tedious, lengthy processes by reducing training time. A more intuitive dashboard means that drivers spend less time learning how to use and become comfortable with the software. Fleets benefit by saving money, time, and resources.
Trucking industry will benefit from embracing digital transformationManagers and executives working to meet demand, increase efficiency and hire, train, and retain drivers need reliable fleet optimization solutions. In the midst of a pandemic and driver shortage, fleets that utilize route and workflow optimization technology can accomplish more with less. These digital transformation efforts use data and AI to improve decision-making and enable fleets to rise above the competition.
The future of transportation management has arrived; those who choose to ignore the technology will find themselves left far behind.

Electric bikes come with substantial environmental and social benefits, but some marginalized communities are being left out. Here’s why — and what they’re doing about it. 
By Henry Latourette Miller 
This summer has the potential to be the first season of a new era of biking in Portland. It follows a year that saw bike sales skyrocket, the introduction of electric bikes (e-bikes) to Biketown, the expansion of Biketown’s service area to the north and east, and the restriction of car traffic to install sidewalk cafes and improve streets for walkers and rollers.
While these developments are exciting, it is hard to overstate the potential for e-bikes to inject new energy into Portland’s bike culture, which had seen bike commuter rates slide in the years before the pandemic.
By allowing Portlanders to go greater distances with less effort than a normal bike, thanks to an electric motor and battery, e-bikes can bring together the necessary reduction in emissions from cars with America’s love of independent mobility. Unlike scooters, e-bikes are more comfortable when traveling across town and can be powerful enough to carry multiple riders along with groceries and school bags. This power makes it easier for Portlanders to swap what was once a car trip to the store, school or office with a more sustainable mode of transportation, even if they do not have access to good transit options. If enough people make that switch, e-bikes can contribute to making our streets less congested, less polluted, safer and more efficient.
Yet Portland’s embrace of new transportation technologies has often come at the cost of already marginalized community members. This is especially the case for low-income residents and people of color, many of who were pushed out of their neighborhoods to build projects like the Interstate-5 corridor or by the gentrification that followed the construction of TriMet’s MAX Yellow Line.
Jump to years later, and many of the low-income and communities of color in outer Portland neighborhoods that did not experience the same rapid pace of gentrification were also not included in the early service areas of Biketown and e-scooter shares. While the reasons these neighborhoods were excluded from shared mobility in its early years may have been different from the outwardly racist and classist reasoning behind the location of I-5, in many cases the communities left out of the benefits of new technology are the same.
Considering the weight of this history, Portland’s agencies and community leaders have many mountains to climb to ensure e-mobility does not slide into the ravines of injustice created by previous planning decisions.
To see how this can be accomplished, I spoke to five advocates who are working with or within communities that have traditionally been denied the benefits of new transportation technology while shouldering its costs. During our conversations, these advocates revealed four core obstacles to a truly equitable e-bike landscape: price, privacy, payment methods and the built environment.
Price
The first barrier most people encounter when considering e-mobility is the price. At the moment, quality personal-use e-bikes cost at least $1,000, not including the cost of storage and maintenance. This is a lot of money to spend if the initial intention is to use the e-bike as a backup mode of transportation or recreational device.
For those who are interested in e-bikes but cannot afford to drop $1,000 just to try out a new way to get around, shared e-bikes are the best way to test the water without getting too wet.
Yet even though Portland’s bike share, Biketown, lowers the upfront cost to e-bikes for Portlanders, it can still be expensive over time. An annual Biketown membership is $99 plus 10 cents per minute of riding time — a substantial increase over the price of renting the analog Biketown bikes. If you were to bike 40 minutes every workday, the total cost of using your annual Biketown membership today would come to about $1,150.
For someone on a budget who uses their car or TriMet pass not only to get to work, but also to pick up their kids from school or get groceries, switching to Biketown might not make a lot of sense. This is especially true if they have access to free or reduced-price public transit through TriMet’s Low Income Fare Program or the Honored Citizen annual pass, which costs $308 per year.
Cole Lalomia, of the Community Cycling Center, said keeping Biketown’s prices down is critical to making e-biking accessible, as the price, complexity and lack of equipment standardization suggests that affordable personal-use e-bikes could still be years away.
Community Cycling Center is a Northeast Portland-based nonprofit that has been fixing up bikes and teaching kids how to become bike mechanics for two decades. Recently, it has been advocating for better bike infrastructure, including bike parking and greenways in underserved communities, and providing support to community programs and events. Since the start of pandemic, the Community Cycling Center has collaborated with Living Cully on a food pantry delivery program that uses four e-bikes purchased with help from a Portland General Electric grant to deliver food to residents primarily in the Cully neighborhood.
To reduce Biketown’s overall cost for low-income users, Community Cycling Center joined other community-based organizations in 2016 to work with the Portland Bureau of Transportation to create Biketown For All. (Street Roots vendors have been recipients of reduced-priced bike rentals through this program.) Today, Biketown for All allows residents who qualify for state and federal assistance programs such as SNAP food assistance and Oregon Health Plan to pay only $5 per month and five cents per minute, with an additional $20 in free ride credits every month. While this is a jump from the $3-per-month membership Biketown For All provided before the introduction of e-bikes in 2020, riding Biketown’s new bikes 40 minutes every workday can cost as little as $28.50 per month, or $342 a year. Compared to the average annual cost of $8,400 per year to own and maintain a car in Portland, this is a dramatically less expensive way to access a more independent and flexible mobility than transit.
When it comes to Biketown, Lalomia said its new e-bikes “are a gateway into increased e-bike ridership in general.” Lalomia also believes Biketown’s new riders might start saving up to purchase their own e-bikes once they realize “how far they can go, they realize how fast they can go, they realize how little effort they need to put in.”
Privacy and payment methods
Unfortunately, shared mobility providers like Biketown introduce new technological challenges that are trickier to address than prices. Most e-mobility devices are activated with a smartphone and paid for through an online bank account, which local community development corporation Hacienda CDC and digital justice nonprofit Suma have identified as significant barriers to the communities they serve.
While electronic payments can cut down substantially on the hassle of e-mobility and other essential services for many, not every Portlander has a smartphone or bank account. Despite Biketown For All and a few private shared mobility companies allowing riders to pay for memberships using cash or a prepaid debit card, those riders typically have to travel downtown to make this transaction.
Suma Executive Director Alan Hipólito pointed out that this extra step is a reflection of how frontline communities, who could benefit just as much or more from better mobility options and reduced emissions, have not been given the opportunity to shape shared mobility. “Many of these systems are set up to be technologically seamless,” said Hipólito. “And when you try to go outside of that, it’s by definition a workaround.”
Hacienda CDC’s Jessica Lam has also found that just because someone has a smartphone and bank account, it does not mean they feel comfortable using the Biketown app or sharing their personal information online. “A lot of our families rely on younger kids, the high school kids, to help navigate all of that,” said Lam, who praised a Suma workshop that taught a small group of Hacienda’s community members how to navigate the internet safely. The workshop included lessons on inputting personal information safely and avoiding phishing scams.
Suma is working to address the above challenges through community organizing, training and informational sessions, and by creating its own community-based digital platform (the “secret sauce” of which Hipólito kept under wraps).
“One of the challenges of technology is that there are not many technology companies that are started specifically with an eye to address poverty or justice. So companies don’t come to neighborhoods like Cully to build platforms to co-create them with people who live there. That’s what we are trying to do,” said Hipólito. “We think there’s an opportunity at the community level to build a different kind of platform that is specifically built to serve these kinds of communities, that is specifically built to overcome cost, privacy and banking.”
The built environment
For decades, most of Portland’s streets were designed and redesigned for the benefit of the automobile, usually at the cost of safety for pedestrians and cyclists. Even as the Portland Bureau of Transportation continues to install better bike and pedestrian infrastructure on Northeast Portland streets such as Killingsworth Street and Cully Boulevard, many frontline communities live in areas with a higher density of PBOT-identified High Crash Network streets and intersections.
In the 2000s, Hacienda CDC created Verde, a nonprofit that serves low-income residents of Cully by “building environmental wealth” for the community. While Cully saw more of its streets included in Biketown’s 2020 service area expansion, Verde’s director of strategic partnerships, Vivian Satterfield, believes that substantial infrastructure investments are needed in Cully before we can expect residents to feel safe using e-bikes to get around. “While some may feel confident taking a bicycle or another mobility device on a gravel road, a majority of folks don’t find that confidence easily,” said Satterfield, referring to the concentration of unpaved streets in Cully.
While Satterfield sees the merit of shared mobility provided by private companies, she stressed that the priority in Cully should be affordable, accessible and frequent mass transit, “because then we have all the public investments that support a mass transit system. Stuff like sidewalks and paved streets and lower speed limits in thoroughfares, and transportation infrastructure like shelter and lighting. That’s public infrastructure, and I don’t believe that private enterprises are ever going to deliver all of those corollary needs.”
Despite the inhospitable environment for cyclists in Portland’s outer neighborhoods, the Rosewood Initiative’s Jossie de la Garza has noticed more people in the neighborhood taking interest in recreational biking since the pandemic began.
The area de la Garza’s organization serves is still beyond Biketown’s service area, but she has noticed the bike repair shop next to the organization’s headquarters on Southeast 162nd Avenue and Stark Street staying busy throughout the past year. “COVID has definitely made it apparent how much outdoor space does matter, especially in the Rosewood neighborhood, where you have a lot of apartment complexes, but not enough green space,” de la Garza said.
Yet this enthusiasm for bikes as a form of recreation also hints at why some residents might never use their bikes for anything more. It’s not just the high traffic and car speeds that punish cyclists in the outer east-side neighborhoods. A history of poor transit access and a lack of nearby job centers and services mean that if you decide to bike for utility, you likely face a long ride.
De la Garza said larger families would struggle to rely on regular bikes for non-recreational trips, as the distances and errands — from groceries to visiting the doctor to picking up kids from school — would be too unwieldy. De la Garza believes e-bikes might address these practical problems to some degree.
While adding new bike infrastructure would make it safer to bike in the neighborhood, de la Garza thinks there are community members who would be concerned that it might result in gentrification of a neighborhood that is 30% Latino. “That’s something we always have in the back of our mind, and I think that’s why it’s much more important to have the community involved” with any new bike infrastructure projects in the neighborhood.
Both Lam and de la Garza said they expect their organizations to work with PBOT this summer to discuss improving bike infrastructure and Biketown access for their communities. In the meantime, de la Garza expects to see even more residents take up biking around the neighborhood.
Hope for the future
Despite the challenges, Hipólito believes there is an opportunity for shared e-mobility to be different than previous innovations in transportation.
Many private shared mobility providers are new companies in a political environment where it is getting harder to ignore the negative consequences their services might have on frontline communities. Some e-mobility providers “are seeing a real opportunity to serve frontline communities,” Hipólito said.
As e-mobility is still a young industry, Hipólito believes these companies have the flexibility to decide, “Well, just because we did something this way over here doesn’t mean we can’t try something different in Cully, or in this other community in Portland, if it means we have a chance to respond to what the community wants us to do.”

Researchers say the future of transportation will be shaped by three “revolutions” – vehicle electrification, driverless cars and ride-sharing – that could result in fewer automobiles on the road, less fossil fuels extracted from the Earth and less pollution in the air. While the environmental gains may seem self-evident, the health benefits are difficult to quantify.
Now for the first time, a Cornell-led team has used transdisciplinary systems modeling to calculate those health benefits in the United States. By 2050, these innovations could potentially slash petroleum consumption by 50% and carbon dioxide emissions by 75% while simultaneously preventing 5,500 premature deaths, with an annual savings of $58 billion.
“There are all these important emerging trends in the development of transportation, and they are becoming a reality in the near future,” said Oliver Gao, the Howard Simpson Professor of civil and environmental engineering in the College of Engineering, who led the project.
“Have you ever thought about what all these revolutions mean for your health, for our climate, and for our environment, and for our energy systems?” Gao said. “These externalities don’t necessarily come directly in the mind of the general public, the travelers, or even the decision-makers.”
The group’s paper, “Shared Use of Electric Autonomous Vehicles: Air Quality and Health Impacts of Future Mobility in the United States,” published June 26 in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. The paper’s lead author is former postdoctoral researcher Shuai Pan.
“It is worthwhile to understand the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies, as deep de-carbonization is needed in the transportation sector,” Pan said.
Co-authors include Lewis M. Fulton from the University of California, Davis, and Yunsoo Choi and Jia Jung from the University of Houston. The research was supported by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Center for Transportation, Environment and Community Health, and by Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology.
While previous studies have looked at certain facets of transportation innovation, such as the impact of electric vehicles on fuel usage and emissions, this is the first time anyone has employed a transdisciplinary systems approach that factored in human health and the associated economic benefits, according to Gao.
Gao’s systematics research group – which uses modeling to understand complex global challenges in engineering, business, societal well-being and sustainability – is uniquely positioned for such a task.
“A transportation engineer cannot address these questions,” Gao said. “Environmental science cannot address these questions. A health researcher cannot address these questions. However, this transdisciplinary group can do this.”
Pan, Fulton and Gao built an integrated assessment system that included a technical-economic mobility model, a chemical transport model and a health impact assessment tool. Then they projected the vehicle stocks, distance traveled, energy usage and carbon dioxide emissions in the continental U.S. through 2050, and quantified the impacts of changing emissions on concentrations of fine particulate matter in the atmosphere, as well as the ensuing health and economic benefits of populations in 10 major metropolitan areas.
Their simulations show that, depending on how widely the three “revolutions” are adopted, reductions in emissions from passenger travel could prevent between 2,300 and 8,100 premature deaths annually in the U.S. in 2050.
The largest number of prevented deaths coincided with large metropolitan areas, such as Los Angeles and Chicago. At the state level, California, Texas, New York, Ohio and Florida would see the largest decreases in premature mortality.
The associated economic benefits could range from $24 billion to $84 billion annually.
The study hangs on a number of assumptions and uncertainties. After all, driverless cars are not yet commercially available, and sales of electric vehicles lag far behind conventional gas guzzlers.
“Another key finding is that for carbon mitigations and health benefits, vehicle electrification is by far the most important piece, followed by shared mobility (ride-sharing) and then automation, ” Pan said. “The net energy impacts of self-driving vehicles are highly uncertain and automation alone may not dramatically affect energy use, emissions or vehicle-related pollution. ”
A complicating factor is that the efficiency improvement and projected cost reduction from automation could actually lead to increased travel and offset other gains.
“If we automate the vehicles, you might make the transportation system more efficient, but probably more people will travel longer distances,” Gao said. “So there is a balance, there is a trade-off.”
The study concludes that policymakers can help encourage the transition to electric vehicles and boost ride sharing, for example, by issuing tighter fuel economy standards, creating economic incentives for shared mobility and investing in charging infrastructure and technological developments.
A future of autonomous flying taxis
Of course, actually creating such transportation innovations is not possible without first determining their viability.
Another research project from Gao’s lab – published July 6 in Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice – explores the feasibility of an airport shuttle service that uses autonomous flying taxis as a means to mitigate urban congestion. The paper’s lead author is Emily Lewis ’20.
“While you are stuck in traffic from JFK [International Airport] to Manhattan, have you ever thought, oh, I wish I could be a bird, just to fly there. Actually, that dream is not too far away,” said Gao, who directs Cornell’s Center for Transportation, Environment and Community Health. “But how do you even architect a whole system, from the technology to market prediction and to operation? Would such an idea make economic sense at all?”
The study focuses on the concept of urban air mobility – essentially a transportation service for low-altitude airspace in metropolitan areas that features autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles.
Gao’s team – which included co-authors Jesse Ponnock ’20, Qamar Cherqaoui ’20, Scott Holmdahl ’20,Yus Johnson ’20 and Alfred Wong ’20 – focused on the three busiest airports in the U.S.: Atlanta, Los Angeles and Dallas.
They used a holistic, system-architecture analysis to identify each area’s key stakeholders and the goals that meet their needs, such as fleet management, infrastructure, traffic control, safety, user experience, financial viability and performance. The modeling also took into account the relationships between annual profit, mean time between safety incidents, upfront costs and the number of passengers shuttled per day.
“Because of its geographic, meteorological and also demand factors, Los Angeles turns out to be the best case for a pilot city,” Gao said.
The analysis identified wealthy commuters, long-distance commuters, business executives, event attendees, emergency transportation and vacationers as potential early adopters of an air mobility system.
What would such a system actually look like from a passenger’s perspective? It might not be too different from the ride-sharing services of today. The analysis recommended the system use FIFO (first in, first out) queuing and a smartphone interface for passengers, which may sound familiar to anyone who has ever hailed an Uber on their phone.
Also recommended: a hybrid energy source that incorporates electric energy for the autonomous vehicles.
But vehicles and apps are only part of it. For an air mobility system to become a reality, it would need the infrastructure to support it.
“This is not actually as mature as electrification or even automation,” Gao said. “This is even further away down the road. We are not comparing urban air mobility to other modes or arguing this is a better mode. We’re just saying that now, given the interest, first you need to be able to architect this. And then you will have a better sense about cost.”

Flying cars are almost a byword for the misplaced optimism of technologists, but recent news suggests their future may be on slightly firmer footing. The industry has seen a major influx of capital and big automakers seem to be piling in.
What actually constitutes a flying car has changed many times over the decades since the cartoon, The Jetsons, introduced the idea to the popular imagination. Today’s incarnation is known more formally as an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.
As the name suggests, the vehicles run on battery power rather than aviation fuel, and they’re able to take off and land like a helicopter. Designs vary from what are essentially gigantic multi-rotor drones to small fixed-wing aircraft with rotors that can tilt up or down, allowing them to hover or fly horizontally (like an airplane).
Aerospace companies and startups have been working on the idea for a number of years, but recent news suggests it might be coming closer to fruition. Last Monday, major automakers Hyundai and GM said they are developing vehicles of their own and are bullish about the prospects of this new mode of transport.
And the week prior, British flying car maker Vertical Aerospace announced plans to go public in a deal that values the company at $2.2 billion. Vertical Aerospace also said it had received $4 billion worth of preorders, including from American Airlines and Virgin Atlantic.
The deal was the latest installment in a flood of capital into the sector, with competitors Joby Aviation, Archer Aviation, and Lilium all recently announcing deals to go public too. Also joining them is Blade Urban Mobility, which currently operates heliports but plans to accommodate flying cars when they become available.
When exactly that will be is still uncertain, but there seems to be growing consensus that the second half of this decade might be a realistic prospect. Vertical is aiming to start deliveries by 2024. And the other startups, who already have impressive prototypes, are on a similar timeline.
Hyundai’s global chief operating officer, José Muñoz, told attendees at Reuters’ Car of the Future conference that the company is targeting a 2025 rollout of an air taxi service, while GM’s vice president of global innovation, Pamela Fletcher, went with a more cautious 2030 target. They’re not the only automakers getting in on the act, with Toyota, Daimler, and China’s Geely all developing vehicles alone or in partnership with startups.
Regulators also seem to be increasingly open to the idea.
In January, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced it expects to certify the first eVTOLs later this year and have regulations around their operation in place by 2023. And last month the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said it expected air taxi services to be running by 2024 or 2025.
While it seems fairly settled that the earliest flying cars will be taxis rather than private vehicles, a major outstanding question is the extent to which they will be automated.
The majority of prototypes currently rely on a human to pilot them. But earlier this month Larry Page’s air taxi startup Kitty Hawk announced it would buy drone maker 3D Robotics as it seeks to shift to a fully autonomous setup. The FAA recently created a new committee to draft a regulatory path for beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) autonomous drone flights. This would likely be a first step along the path to allowing unmanned passenger aircraft.
What seems more certain is that there will be winners and losers in the recent rush to corner the air mobility market. As Chris Bryant points out in Bloomberg, these companies still face a host of technological, regulatory, and social hurdles, and the huge amounts of money flooding into the sector may be hard to justify.
Regardless of which companies make it out the other side, it’s looking increasingly likely that air taxis will be a significant new player in urban transport by the end of the decade.

Autonomous vehicle technologies have been around for years. You can see some of them in machinery such as agriculture and paving equipment, as well as automobiles such as passenger vehicles and even heavy-duty trucks.
Back in 2016, a project known as the Colorado beer run showcased the possibilities of vehicle autonomy in the trucking industry. A human drove a tractor-trailer loaded with Budweiser beer onto I-25. The driver then put the truck into self-driving mode before retiring to the sleeper. That truck operated autonomously for roughly 3 hours and 130 miles, right down to the braking and turn signaling.
“Just from looking at this project, we know these types of technologies are already close to prime time,” said Dan Murray, senior vice president of the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI), keynote speaker at AEM’s recently held member education webinar on autonomous vehicles.
Widespread adoption is of course the ultimate goal, but companies need to prepare for the investments that are needed in their organizations and in our infrastructure.
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO ROI
ATRI has done extensive research in the area of autonomous vehicle technology adoption. Motor carriers and drivers share many of the same desires and concerns. At the top of the list are upfront investment and insurance premiums.
“Autonomous equipment has a high upfront cost,” Murray said. “It’s typical to spend $130,000 for a tractor today. But a tractor with autonomous technologies will easily cost $185,000 to $200,000. This means that, ultimately, the cost to transport goods is going to be higher. If a motor carrier can’t pass that cost onto its customer, what real benefit is in it for them?”
Something similar can be said about insurance premiums. According to Murray, an investment in autonomous technologies that make vehicles safer does not translate to reduced premiums. So again, the motor carrier or driver (owner/operator) sees no immediate financial benefit to making that investment.
“Additionally, trial lawyers are drooling over this environment,” Murray added. U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) data shows that roughly 89% of critical crash factors are associated with human factors. The remaining 11% are vehicle and component-related faults.
“With autonomous vehicles, it will probably be a flipflop,” Murray suggested. “You’ll likely see changes in the model of litigation, but litigation itself is not going away. There are some opportunities to improve safety with autonomous technologies, but do not assume litigation will go the way of the dinosaur.”
Another financial factor standing in the way of adoption is the fact that there will still be driver costs. The days of fully autonomous, driverless vehicles are far down the road. Plus, drivers still have a long list of inspection and reporting tasks that must be completed on a routine basis.
One other financial deterrent is the fact that no tax credits exist for autonomous technology investment — at least not yet.
“The good news is that the U.S. DOT may be contemplating tax credits for implementing some of these technologies,” Murray pointed out. “It’s hard to tell if Congress would ultimately end up authorizing such credits. But the fact that this is even being considered is a positive indication.”
6 MORE KEYS TO AUTONOMOUS ADOPTION
Driver acceptance is an adoption prerequisite identified by both motor carriers and drivers. In order to move toward widescale adoption, drivers must want them on the trucks, vans and other vehicles they are employed to operate. One in-road is that autonomous technology helps attract a new pool of potential drivers to the profession. As Murray noted, these high-tech cabs could appeal to younger, more tech-savvy individuals. That could go a long way toward helping solve the driver shortage issue that has been plaguing several industries.Weather can be a challenge for autonomous systems, especially when driving in the northern states where snow and ice can impede radar, lidar and camera systems. Rain and fog can have a crippling effect, too. “These systems will not be able to be used in northern environments for another 3 to 5 years, if not 10,” Murray speculated.Construction zones. Today’s popular autonomous technologies like radar and lidar can also be negatively impacted by construction zones. The larger the project and longer the duration, the bigger the impact.Inadequate infrastructure. Speaking of road construction projects, infrastructure in general is another challenge. Roadway defects like potholes and faded lane striping make it difficult to impossible for autonomous vehicles to operate.Traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is not friendly toward an autonomous vehicle. “Drivers don’t want all of those advanced warning systems going off nonstop as traffic congestion builds on both sides of the vehicle,” Murray said. “Most of these autonomous systems will be best used out on the open road, away from all of this urban congestion.” As e-commerce has exploded over the past year, a new opportunity for autonomy has emerged. More delivery fleets are venturing into suburban and rural areas. These represent the ideal applications for autonomous technologies to be deployed. This could help accelerate adoption.Murray said the federal government isn’t doing enough to advance the concept of autonomous delivery vehicles. Murray would like to see programs and regulations become standardized on a federal level so autonomous vehicles can better operate across state lines. “If you’re platooning in Minnesota, for instance, you’re allowed to have an 80-foot headway between the vehicles,” Murray explained. “When you get to Wisconsin, it drops to 40 feet. Once in Illinois, it goes back up to 65 feet. The poor driver can’t be pulling over at every state line to change the calibration of the vehicle’s sensors. If we don’t have a seamless interstate system, we won’t have a safe, efficient and productive autonomous transportation system.”
OFF-ROAD AUTONOMOUS APPLICATIONS
While challenges may stand in the way of widespread adoption of autonomous vehicle technologies, they have been making their mark in off-road applications for several years now.
The first autonomous testing began in Japan in 1990. However, the process actually began with the release of the Field Management Software (FMS) for mines in the late 1980s, and it drove the subsequent development of Komatsu’s autonomous platform.
The inaugural commercial deployment took place in Chile in 2007, and a second system was launched a year later at a Western Australia-based iron ore mining operation. Finally, in 2013, Komatsu introduced the world’s first dozer with fully automatic blade control.
The lessons learned from those efforts eventually led to the first North American deployment in 2016. By 2018, Komatsu had moved over 2 billion tons, with 130 fully autonomous mining trucks running across seven operational sites (six of which are fully autonomous sites). As of June 2020, the numbers jumped to to 3 billion tons moved by 251 trucks, and the fleet still maintained a perfect safety record with no incidents as of that time.
Caterpillar has also embraced autonomous vehicle technologies. The company had 276 autonomous trucks in operation have driven over 42 million miles without a lost-time injury, as of late 2020. In addition, Caterpillar has doubled the amount it has hauled autonomously since reaching the 1 billion-ton mark in November of 2018.
As of late 2020, autonomous vehicles held a market share of less than 1% of total construction equipment sales worldwide. However, given global equipment sales are projected to grow 2.5% each year until 2022, coupled with the exponential growth in adoption of AVs, the market share is expected to double in size in the next couple of years.
Autonomous heavy haulers are already in use in mining in several countries, with automated agricultural and forestry equipment currently being developed as well. While a combination of GPS and other location tracking sensors, image sensors and telematics assist John Deere vehicles to navigate fields today, the company still can’t truly replicate everything a human would see and feel sitting in the tractor cab. The determining factors here are farmer perception and added value. This will remain the case until more tasks, and not just movement, become automated.
Meanwhile, the forestry sector has seen limited progress with automation, largely due to working conditions being over considerably larger areas than those experienced by the other sectors. Work sites are often in remote areas, on steep slopes, and in very rugged and variable terrain. In these remote areas, there are generally no cell towers and no Wi-Fi, and communication is currently expensive with limited bandwidth. The next generation of very large fleets of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, however, is expected to address this problem.
In addition, construction contractors are applying self-driving machinery to do repetitive tasks, such as pouring concrete, bricklaying, welding and even demolition. Excavation and other prep work is also being completed by autonomous or semi-autonomous bulldozers, which can ready a jobsite with the help of a human programmer to exact specifications.
TECHNOLOGIES BEING ADOPTED
Differential GPS represents one of the more promising autonomous technologies today, according to Murray. Consider the fact that GPS on the typical smartphone is fairly accurate with a resolution of roughly 10 feet. “You can’t see what lane you’re in, but you can certainly see what road you’re on,” Murray said. “With differential GPS, a correction signal gets you down to just a couple of centimeters. If you add that to an autonomous system, you suddenly have an all-weather fighter, which is really important in northern states.”
Murray is especially excited about camera monitoring systems. “The U.S. DOT has exempted side-view mirrors on trucks and large vehicles if you have video mirrors,” Murray said. “Not only does that technology give drivers a wider field of view and improved safety, but a vehicle can also get 1-2% fuel economy benefit by removing the big, obsolete side-view mirrors.”
As Murray noted, most tractor-trailers in operation today do not employ ADAS technologies, but the list is as follows (Below percentages are approximate.)
Adaptive steering control – 92%Camera-based mirror system – 90%Active lane centering assist – 90%Active lane keep assist – 85%Driver-facing camera – 82%Blind spot warning – 80%Auto emergency braking – 70%Lane departure warning – 70%Forward collision warning – 62%Adaptive cruise control – 62%
ATRI recently completed an extensive study where motor carriers and drivers were asked which technologies they wanted to consider adopting. Automated emergency braking topped the list at 16%, followed closely by forward collision warning and road-facing cameras at 14%. Lane detection warning was cited by roughly 10% of those surveyed.
There is an important distinction to be made regarding motor carrier attitudes vs. driver attitudes.
“While the motor carriers are pretty excited about many of these systems, that’s not so much the case with the drivers,” Murray pointed out. Many tractor-trailer drivers are in their mid-40s or older. This demographic tends to be extra cautious where technology is concerned. Some are even downright cynical.
“There is a lot of education, promotion and awareness that needs to happen in order to convince drivers that these technologies are not going to put them out of a job,” Murray said. “These technologies are just going to make the driver experience easier, better and safer.”
Both drivers and motor carriers also need a little convincing where investment and ROI are concerned. If some of those hurdles could be cleared, autonomous adoption could accelerate in coming years.

According to the United Nations, the world’s population continues to rise. By 2050, it is expected to increase by 2 billion to reach 9.7 billion. Around 2100, it could peak at nearly 11 billion. Currently, about 55 percent of the world’s population lives in cities; in the coming 30 years, this percentage will reach 68%. This means more pressure on the world’s cities to provide better sustainability management, resource utilization, and urban areas development.
The solution lies in smarter cities.
What Is a Smart City?
Smart cities use IoT devices to collect and analyze data and allow automation and tasks to be carried out without human intervention. Diverse IoT devices are connected and communicate for different tasks.
Cities use the information collected to improve infrastructure, public utilities, services, and more. Smart cities are more efficient and safe to live in, providing a higher quality lifestyle for their residents.
The Growth of IoT
IoT is set to grow into one of the smartest collective and collaborative systems in history. According to numbers from the “Improving Internet of Things (IoT) Security with Software-Defined Network (SDN)” study, there will be more than 75.44 billion connected IoT devices by 2025, over 7.33 billion mobile users by 2023, and more than 1,105 million connected wearable devices users by 2022.IoT-enabled smart cities offer a solution to many of our population-related social problems. Take a deeper look at the solutions a smart city provides.Click To Tweet
What does it mean to be a smart city? Already, the overall value of worldwide deals related to smart cities between the first quarter of 2019 and the last quarter of 2020 totaled $17.24 billion. This represents a 123.48 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase. Different sectors of smart cities include:
Smart homes: Residences containing devices connected to the internet. Devices such as lights, fridges, and televisions communicate with each other and share data to users.Smart healthcare: Wearable and nonwearable devices that can monitor and measure the activities of user health, measuring temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugar, and many other factors.Smart environment: Intelligent sensors installed for the development of city infrastructure. These sensors control and monitor the conditions of the surroundings (such as air quality and lighting) to provide a healthier environment.Smart transportation: Optimized services and innovative devices enhance city transportation. These services can include smart parking, traffic flow, number plate recognition, supply chain management and so on.Smart surveillance: A diverse array of security and surveillance devices are installed around the city to prevent incidents from occurring and for quick action in case of an emergency.
According to a study by IoT Analytics, smart cities prioritize IoT technology in several interesting ways. The top priorities among decision-makers from some of the world’s leading smart cities are:
Connected public transport (74%)Traffic monitoring and management (72%)Water level / flood monitoring (72%)Video surveillance and analytics (72%)Connected streetlights (68%)Weather monitoring (68%)Air quality / Pollution monitoring (68%)Smart metering – water (66%)Fire / smoke detection (66%)Water quality monitoring (64%)
Let’s take a look at these smart city applications in more detail.
Public Transport
Key goals of any city’s public transport system include greater efficiency and reliability. Smart technology is key to enabling just this. For example, the Polish city of Lublin implemented an innovative passenger information system for connected public transport that revolutionized the city’s bus transit system. Smart devices were installed on vehicles to transmit real-time data to a dispatch center software. This software then relays that information to electronic displays at bus stops and online portals to inform users of the real-time status of their transport options.
Traffic Monitoring
Managing traffic flow is one of the biggest challenges for today’s cities. Smart city devices can ease traffic pain points and improve safety. In Los Angeles, the government installed a network of sensors that transmit real-time traffic updates to a traffic management platform. The platform then adjusts the timing of traffic signals to optimize traffic flow.
Water Level Monitoring
Especially with the real impacts of climate change and urban sprawl, flooding has become a problem in cities worldwide. Smart sensors installed in key areas can detect water levels and report flooding incidents or potential flooding incidents in real-time.
Smart Video Surveillance
Smart video surveillance has been around for a long time, and these cameras are commonly used to police the world’s roads and highways. ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras are also commonly used by law enforcement to identify stolen cars, enforce traffic control, collect tolls and deter crime. Today’s smart video surveillance cameras work within an integrated security system to predict crimes before they even happen.
Connected Streetlights
Connected streetlights and lighting solutions have many benefits, including reducing energy consumption and costs, reducing maintenance costs, increased public safety, safer traffic, and measurable environmental impact. Today’s smart streetlights can also double up as EV chargers and monitor emissions and serve as wireless broadband connection points.
Weather Monitoring

Smart, real-time, and predictive weather monitoring helps city management predict and manage weather disruptions and severe weather events.
Snow forecasting could be help cities assess where best to station their snowplows (as well as assess the maintenance status and availability of snowplows). Determining where extra cooling may be required (especially for senior citizens or disabled residents). Micro-forecasts of rain, fog, and snow could be linked to accident data to predict and prevent the likelihood of traffic accidents. Wind and temperature data allows first responders to plan where best to position firefighters to deal with a wildfire.
Air Quality Monitoring
Smart cities aim to provide a decent quality of life to their citizens by offering a clean and sustainable environment. Air quality monitoring helps city management to identify and mitigate the sources of pollution. Using a network of low-cost air quality monitoring sensors, the city can detect sources of pollution and take corrective measures to improve the city’s environmental health.
Smart Metering
The smart meter or automated meter reader is a top IoT device among utility companies. These devices attach to or replace traditional utility meters to provide real-time consumption data, allowing the utility companies to manage energy flow more effectively. This includes identifying and implementing resource efficiencies for a lower carbon footprint.
Fire and Smoke Detection
Having fire and smoke detectors around a city improves emergency management and preparedness. Smart fire and smoke detection sensors provide real-time information about the direction, location, or magnitude. The prediction and early detection of fire and smoke in smart cities can reduce large-scale damage and improve public safety significantly, in addition to warning city management, mass warning systems that can provide emergency alerts to the city’s population.
Water Quality Monitoring
Water hygiene is a crucial aspect of city safety. One of the ways that water safety is enabled through smart technology is with an automated Legionella compliance system, which automates the process of Legionella management and compliance. Instead of manually taking readings of every water outlet, the system takes the temperature of the water and flushes the system at regular intervals. Automated reporting and record-keeping saves time and ensures accuracy.
It’s time for cities to graduate to a smarter solution.
Connected smart city devices make everyday tasks easier and more efficient while relieving pain points related to public safety, traffic, and environmental issues. To make smart cities viable, the technology needs to be scalable, affordable, secure, and easy to deploy. Smarter Technologies’ Orion Data Network ticks all the boxes, helping cities worldwide become safer, cleaner, and better places to live for the world’s growing population.

 In this special guest feature, Gilad Avrashi, CTO & Co-Founder at MDgo, believes that now is the time for the insurance industry to leverage AI technology to unlock the power of data and provide personalized services that customers demand to retain them as loyal customers. 

Data is transforming the way we live and how consumers engage with service providers. Most industries are using data to personalize offerings for customers and provide real-time expertise to strengthen relationships while gaining consumer trust. We are seeing this with Netflix making personalized movie recommendations based on the viewer’s specific interests and history. Now is the time for the insurance industry to leverage AI technology to unlock the power of data and provide personalized services that customers demand to retain them as loyal customers.
In addition to leveraging data for personalized services, insurance providers must compete on price to retain today’s customers. AI technology gives insurers the data needed to streamline the claims process, while reducing costs to pass savings off to customers. Leveraging data from advanced technologies to better understand drivers and accidents drives customer retention, brand loyalty and savings.
Despite the obvious benefits of leveraging data, very few insurers currently do it, creating gaps between their capabilities and customers’ immediate needs and expectations. For instance, according to the OECD, 44% of car crash fatalities could have been prevented if real-time data on the type and severity of their injuries were available for emergency medical services and treating hospitals. Indeed, AI technology has the power to uncover real-time insights from car accidents including occupants’ injuries and vehicle damage, providing lifesaving information to medical teams.
Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, ADR technology (Accident Detection and Response) can analyze the crash pulse recorded by vehicle telematics devices and virtual sensors to provide detailed reports. Beyond life-saving capabilities, AI can provide personalized services to drivers, such as automatically recommending a tow truck or autobody shop after an accident, as well as other location-based associated services.
ADR, powered by AI technology and machine learning capabilities, has huge potential for data applications in the insurance industry, and here’s a bit about how it works, beginning from the moment a crash occurs.
Gain access crash and injury data powered by machine learning
ADR’s initial, and potentially most significant, application of AI is to extrapolate crash test data to better understand and predict the connection between vehicle acceleration (or deceleration) and potential injuries. Advanced machine learning algorithms are used in tandem with physical sensor devices installed in the vehicle to accurately detect crashes as they happen. In order to address one of the most significant pain points of insurers, i.e. accurate and real time first notice of loss, which is driven by a low false negative and false positive rate. 
The physical sensor “wakes up” when it senses a shift in the vehicle’s acceleration, guaranteeing that no event goes undetected and lowering the false negative rate. Then, machine learning algorithms gain a complete picture of the crash, which makes it possible to remove the possibility of false positives. Finally, once a crash is detected, the damage and injury insights are provided using deep learning models, making it possible to deliver insurers detailed crash reports in real-time.
How is this done, you might ask? That’s where the concept of ADR’s unique virtual sensors come into the picture. Using cutting-edge deep learning networks, vehicle motion sensor readings are translated into virtual sensors, or a grid of dozens of sensors that are usually set up to determine potential vehicle damages and occupant injuries in crash test scenarios, such as those conducted by automotive OEMs.
 These sensors are virtually placed in and around the vehicle and its occupants, thereby emulating a world where you potentially walk around with an accelerometer inside of your head to assess potential injuries, without ever having to install any additional hardware. This imaginary “hardware” or virtual sensors makes it possible to determine where an occupant involved in a crash has been injured – delivering this information both to their insurer and, more importantly, to first responders and medical personnel.
Finally, each crash is identified by a unique crash pulse, which is used as its fingerprint. Machine learning algorithms analyze the fingerprint and construct a full crash profile, which is then translated into accurate damage and injury insights, providing an objective view of the accident. Access to these detailed data could decrease costs for insurance providers as gain access to a complete picture of a crash and its immediate consequences for the occupants.
Making the delivery of personalized services and care for policyholders possible
Beyond lifesaving capabilities, AI can automatically assist drivers in the recovery process following an accident. Having crash data readily available allows insurers to automatically make recommendations for recovery. Imagine receiving a message from your provider immediately after a wreck letting you know a tow truck is on the way and directing you to the nearest autobody shop. These types of personalized automated engagements are possible with robust data collection and processing beginning at the moment of impact.  
An objective view of accident data is a critical and hitherto limited area of visibility for the auto insurance industry. ADR removes uncertainties by detailing the accident journey in data-driven reports for the insurer. Personalizing recommendations based on data could save insurers money during the claims process as they guide customers to supported garages and gain a clear picture of the accident the moment it occurs, which also delivers personalization value.
In all, AI has immense potential to transform the insurance industry as we know it. We’re about to witness a true top-down shift, be it from offering tailored, personalized services that begin at the moment of impact, to reducing claim costs for insurers by directing policyholders to engage with an affiliated network of services (i.e. DRP body shops and tow trucks). These capabilities and more are made possible with ADR’s real-time sensor data and custom-built AI algorithms, delivering fully objective reports with zero human intervention that help insurers deliver unique life and cost-saving value for policyholders.

South Africa’s economy is easing back towards levels of activity last seen before the Covid-19 lockdown. Logistics fleets are returning to full capacity, and private travel is now similarly back to previous levels.
The reason we can confidently make this assertion is the vast amounts of data now available to us about movement on South African roads. As an operator in the vehicle recovery and fleet management space, we have access to this data.
This data now informs pivotal strategic decisions, it drives business planning, efficiency enhancements, and life-and-death safety initiatives. The source of this vast ocean of information is that popular current buzzword – the Internet of Things (IoT).
IoT technology has been around for decades – even if its name is more recent. Tracking and monitoring devices have long been in use – employing radio and satellite methodology, and later 3G and LTE platforms.
The move towards the mass, high-speed connectivity promised by 5G mobile broadband promises to take the industry to a new level of insight, providing critical data that vastly improves customer services, safety, and profitability.
No longer are IoT insights a nice-to-have capability, or simply a security concern. They are vital. No business operating in the mobility space can afford to ignore the value of IoT.
IoT finds application in several aspects of modern business. In public transport, for instance, camera technology is now used to monitor driver behaviour as well as social-distancing and safety compliance.
Newer-generation cameras are capable of image recognition, customer counts and even remote infrared body-temperature screening.
Initially, short-range RF technology simply told customers the location of their vehicles. As the technology progressed, we were able to gather more information through GPS trackers, cameras and ever more precise sensors.
Today, companies can assess and modify driving behaviour. This has opened up opportunities for both consumers as well as insurers and vehicle finance companies. They can now offer personalised premiums and encourage efficient, safe driving that benefits drivers, businesses and society at large.
We have seen our offering evolve from tracking to connectivity and data management. Technology also now lets us give clients access to data platforms and dashboards where they can manage and customise their own track-and-trace service.
Clients can also now take ownership of their own security, setting geofencing and alert parameters for their vehicles and family members.
Commercial transport firms can set up automated logbooks, panic buttons and driver alerts.
In the consumer space, the next step of technological evolution is the understanding of the car as a permanently connected information and entertainment hub.
When the connected car can guarantee broadband access, the final piece of the puzzle falls into place. We can now move seamlessly between our home, vehicle and office environments while remaining connected throughout. This is the dawn of the Connected Life.
Thanks to IoT, this state of eternal connectivity generates constant, exponentially growing amounts of data. The challenge, and the true differentiator in an IoT space where equipment is largely commoditised, is how to use and interpret that information.
Data enrichment is the new frontier. A company such as ours has moved from simple vehicle tracking, into the Big Data space. We have built our own Big Data platform, in partnership with Stellenbosch University, which we launched about two years ago. The platform currently processes around 300 million data points per day.
Big Data platforms allow for the provision of data-centric services such as predictive models. For instance, insurance companies can now use drivers’ unique biometric data-sets to identify when performance is impaired due to fatigue or alcohol. In this way, IoT enables the evolution from accident reconstruction to accident prevention, using the power of data.
As far as claims validation goes, data analysis powered by artificial intelligence can make this an almost instantaneous process. 
Another trend we are seeing is OEMs entering the data and connectivity space. While this transition has not yet reached its ultimate form, based on our global partnerships with Toyota, we anticipate carmakers taking ownership of engine- and vehicle-centric information and its connectivity.
Supplementary services, such as theft recovery, and jamming detection will likely be provided by local suppliers. With the rise of the connected vehicle, infotainment will become another differentiator, and possibly another income stream for OEMs, or third-party suppliers.
The final stage of this data-centric move to connected mobility may be the establishment of a single, interoperable data platform, shared by cars, infrastructure, service providers and governments. Until such a scenario arrives, we will see connectivity gradually gaining in significance as the key enabler of movement.
It must not be overlooked that these oceans of data that our mobility now generates come with significant security risks. Cybersecurity is now a mobility issue, and we’ll need to keep building technologies and policies to protect our customers and their data.
The key is proactive threat management, using artificial intelligence to proactively anticipate and manage such threats on a dedicated cybersecurity platform.
IoT is the technology that has transformed modern business. That transformation is taking place in several spaces at once – safety, mobility, accessibility, sustainability, cost control, operations, information and analytics.
Each of these areas offers opportunities for organisations able to build proficiencies themselves, or to build partnerships to provide such services. In an emerging platform economy, where data is ubiquitous, the organizations with the platforms to deliver services using that data will dominate.
Technology is no longer a differentiator, but an enabler. It enables the objectives and strategies of organizations, so they can serve their customers and be competitive. As such, it is indispensable. IoT, overlaid with AI, is no longer a grudge purchase. It’s essential.

After a number of deaths in the US linked to Tesla owners placing too much faith in autonomous driving systems – and amid ongoing investigations by road safety regulators there – Elon Musk says mastering the tech is more difficult than he expected.
Tesla boss Elon Musk has finally admitted what many automotive industry experts have long realised: autonomous vehicle technology is a lot more difficult than it seems, due to the countless variables a car must learn, detect, and avoid while on the move.
In addition to being able to detect lanes, other vehicles, traffic signals and pedestrian movement, fully autonomous cars must learn to pre-empt the behaviour of other drivers and pedestrians in the same way a human would, an almost impossible task.
On social media platform Twitter this week – in response to a query about Tesla’s next update on autonomous tech – Elon Musk wrote: “FSD 9 (Full Self Driving 9) beta is shipping soon I swear! Generalized (autonomous) self-driving is a hard problem, as it requires solving a large part of real-world AI (artificial intelligence).
“Didn’t expect it to be so hard, but the difficulty is obvious in retrospect. Nothing has more degrees of freedom than reality.”
The admission by Elon Musk is being regarded as a relief to industry observers, as car companies have grappled with the roll-out of the technology and, in the US at least, regulators are increasingly keeping a close eye on real-world driving tests of the future tech.
In October 2017 a high-ranking autonomous vehicle expert at US car giant General Motors said Tesla’s claim that it already had the technology for total hands-free driving was “full of crap”.
At the time, Elon Musk said Tesla cars “already have the hardware needed for a full self-driving capability”, known in the industry as a “Level Five” engineering standard.
However in a briefing with Australian media in Detroit at the time, Scott Miller, General Motors’ director of autonomous vehicle integration said: “I think he’s full of crap”, when asked what he thought about Musk’s claim.
“If you think you can see everything you need for a Level Five autonomous (car) with cameras and radar, I don’t know how you do that,” Mr Miller told media in October 2017.
“To be what an SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) Level Five full autonomous system is, I don’t think he (Elon Musk) has the content to do that. Do you really want to trust one sensor measuring the speed of a car coming into an intersection before you pull out? I think you need some confirmation.”
The car industry is now of the view each sensor in an autonomous vehicle needs confirmation from one or more other sensors before making a critical decision, which adds cost and requires phenomenal processing speeds not seen before in automobiles.
While not backing away from his push for autonomous cars, it appears Musk is developing a more level-headed approach to the technology, especially in the wake of fatalities in the US involving Tesla drivers that placed way too much reliance on the self-driving systems.
In a YouTube interview with US automotive industry expert Sandy Munro in February 2021, Musk said: “For self-driving (technology), even if the road is painted completely wrong and a UFO lands in the middle of the road, the car still cannot crash and still needs to do the right thing.”
He continued: “The prime directive for the autopilot system is ‘don’t crash’. That really over-rides everything, no many what the lines say or how the road is done … minimise the probability of impact while getting you to your destination conveniently and comfortably.
Musk said at the time while it would “certainly be helpful to have roads with accurate markings” the car needs to be smarter than that.
“For self-driving, it’s got to be even if someone tries to trick the car (that) they do not succeed in tricking the car, because people will do weird things, it’s got to be maintain safety no matter what … don’t let yourself (Tesla autonomous tech) get tricked.”

Time loss due to traffic jams, rising levels of environmental pollution, an increasing number of fatalities, some of the many woes of urban commuting. Enter smart mobility, a solution based on the use of different modes of transportation instead of one’s personal vehicle. This concept, which runs on the use of carpooling, ridesharing, and bike commuting, has taken cities by storm. Not only that, this market is expected to grow further still though things have been going a little downhill since the advent of the pandemic.
Impact of COVID-19 on the Smart Mobility Market: An Analysis
2020 has been a grim year for all industrial sectors, especially the smart mobility market. The primary reason for the downfall of the smart mobility market can be attributed to a decline in demand for carpooling and ridesharing services across the world, owing to safety concerns.
While it is true that the market is expected to experience even slower growth during 2021, industry experts expect to see the curve rising from the year 2022 onwards. This forecast is based on the belief that adequate safety measures will be introduced for carpooling and ridesharing, such as the placement of plastic barriers between the car’s driver and its passengers.
Factors Affecting the Growth of Smart Mobility
The application of electricity to transportation and the use of carpooling are not novel concepts. In fact, the first Electric Vehicle (EV) was introduced in the US as early as 1889, and by the early 1900s, nearly one-third of the vehicles on the American streets were electricity-powered. It was not until the 1930s that cheap Texas oil made EVs a thing of the past. However, here we stand at the cusp of another golden age wherein EVs and smart mobility are bound to become an essential part of the future.
Having said that, it is natural for one to ask about the significant factors influencing the smart mobility market. The factors may either be drivers or barriers that need to be dealt with the innovation and a common purpose to turn the idea of smart mobility into a living reality.
#1 The Way People Viewed Vehicles are Changing
It was only a few decades back that owning a private car was every family’s dream. Mass production of automobiles and budget-friendly fuel prices brought this ideal within the reach of the average citizen, and as a result, vehicle-centric urban design and personal, door-to-door transportation became the norm.
Today, the scenario is much different. The present millennial-led era prefers not to own a car; instead, this young generation of commuters is shifting in favor of ridesharing services such as Uber or Lyft – they prefer to subscribe to a car-sharing service rather than bear the cost of a personal car, which includes fuel and maintenance costs. Is it any surprise that such new vehicle usage patterns will encourage the growth of the smart mobility market?
#2 Technology is Advancing at a Lightning-Fast Pace
From autonomous vehicles that are smart enough to run on their own to smart parking systems that make the tedious task of parking a piece of cake, technology is the key driver of the smart mobility market. The hyper-connectivity offered by the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G will make it easier for cities to manage traffic, cut down environmental pollution, and make better use of infrastructure. Commuters can have real-time information for smoother and safer transit.
Then, with the use of self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles and drone deliveries, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) predicts that the world may see a whopping 90% reduction in traffic deaths, a 40% reduction in travel time, and a 500% increase in lane capacity. Does it get any smarter than this!
#3 Low Rate of Internet Penetration in Developing Regions
Here’s a barrier to entry for smart mobility systems in full force. Now, the use of ridesharing services requires the involvement of three parties, namely the rider, the driver, and the service provider. The entire process of matching riders with drivers, fare estimation and ride payment are to be carried out via smartphone apps, which in turn require good internet connectivity.
 Unfortunately, some regions, such as Burundi, Chad, and Somalia, among others, have extremely low internet penetration that hinders the development of smart mobility systems in such countries. Once the proper infrastructure for connectivity has been established, the dream of smart mobility can proceed onwards.
#4 An Entirely New Infrastructure and Value Chain is Needed
As much as IoT requires proper infrastructure for connectivity, so does the use of Electric Vehicles require ubiquitous charging infrastructure. The current scenario is pretty awkward wherein potential EV drivers do not see an infrastructure that allows them to buy an EV and drive with confidence, and on the other hand, potential infrastructure providers do not see mass demand insight. Until the time charging stations become as common as gas stations are today, this one barrier-to-entry will make the adoption of EVs a far-fetched dream.
#5 Another Major Driver is Government Policies
Central, state, and city governments can join hands to speed up the adoption of smart mobility systems. Although several US state governments have already directed their focus towards measures such as tax credits and rebates to make smart mobility more affordable for early adopters and are also imposing strict vehicle emission standards for automobile manufacturers, the need of the hour is to offer exclusive EV parking in congested areas, and establishment of ZEZs or Zero Emission Zones wherein traffic will be restricted to bikes, pedestrians, delivery vehicles, and electric vehicles – measures already in place by the city governments of London, Brussels, Paris, and Madrid. Such government policies are sure to accelerate the growth of the smart mobility market.
Top Companies Expected to Dominate the Smart Mobility Market
To create technologically evolved smart mobility solutions, companies need to come up with products that are developed from a long-term market perspective as opposed to short-term creations. This is because as the smart mobility market is set in stone and matures, consumers will naturally demand integrated solutions – a mix of travel services with ancillary services.
As of now, the following companies are expected to take the lead in the future smart mobility market –
CiscoMaaS Global OySiemensTomTom InternationalInnoviz Technologies Inc.Toyota Motor CorporationFord Motor Company, among others.
Despite its present sluggish growth, smart mobility will be a factor in customer preference, changing the way people travel. It’s only a matter of time before this service model comes to the mainstream, and come it will, reaching its projected growth of $70.46 billion by the year 2027.

Five years ago, the expectation was that by 2020 the sight of ‘robotaxis’ and autonomous driverless trucks would be a common sight on our streets. 
Their absence today shows that tech and transport industries have woken up to the fact that creating autonomous vehicles — capable of safely dealing with mixed traffic and hundreds of other variables — is a bigger technical challenge than first imagined. 
Although expectations have been reset to a more reasonable timeframe, the speed of development is still terrific, and the prize for success is access to a multi-billion dollar market.  
“For autonomous driving to take off on-highway we need three things to happen,” said Nils Jaeger, president of Volvo Autonomous Solutions.
“We need to master the technology – especially of perception systems that allow vehicles to travel at high speeds. Secondly, we need society to trust us when we say this new tech is beneficial, and finally we need legislators to adapt laws to give autonomous vehicles access to the highways. It’s a puzzle and we need all the pieces to fall into place.”
While robotaxis are still on the industry’s wish list, the first on-road application for autonomous driving is likely to be in trucking, especially of the hub-to-hub type found in the United States’ interstate highway system.
“As the Volvo Group is one of the world’s largest truck manufacturers, we are putting a lot of effort into solving this problem and developing a credible offering,” Jaeger said. “The creation of Volvo Autonomous Solutions is a clear statement of intent that we want to be a leader in this field.”
Off-highway reality 
Autonomous vehicles may be applicable to on-road yet, but in the confined areas of off-road, autonomous driving technology is mature enough to offer credible alternatives. For off-road, Volvo Autonomous Solutions is focusing on two industry segments, ports and logistics centres, and light mines and quarries.  
Volvo Autonomous Solutions is perhaps unique in its ability to offer automated solutions for both on and off road. With truck and construction divisions within the Volvo Group to source equipment from, and partnerships with Silicon Valley companies and AI leaders to develop autonomous driving architecture.
The company has already developed the TA-15 autonomous quarry hauler solution. It runs on a battery-electric drivetrain and uses GNSS, lidar, radar and multiple sensors. Being selfdriving, the TA-15 has no need for a cabin – making for a dramatically new machine profile. 
“Our approach is to start small, in a tightly confined environment and build on our successes over time,” Jaeger said. “Ports, quarries and light mines fit this profile, as they have clearly defined load-and-drop locations, over generally short circuits. And with carefully mapped out safety plans, there is no need for regulatory changes.” 
Based at Volvo’s Camp X innovation hub in Gothenburg, Sweden, the 51-year-old Jaeger took up his role in the newly formed Volvo Autonomous Solutions on Jan. 1, 2020.
Previously spending 17 years of his career in the agricultural equipment sector, he is no stranger to automated systems. He witnessed first hand the arrival of autonomous steering systems for tractors and harvesting machines, tech that is now embedded in the sector. 
“I’m absolutely convinced that autonomous solutions are beneficial to society,” he said. “This new industry will provide a lot of value – safety, efficiency, flexibility, sustainability and economic. It is impossible to stop progress – this technology is going to happen – and I firmly believe that it will be a force for good. In fact, if we had been further ahead in our development the impact of COVID-19 would have been less.”
When challenged on fears of autonomous machines taking human operator jobs, Jaeger explained “there are already shortages of drivers in many markets, and human operators will continue to be in demand for many years to come.
“Far from being a threat, autonomous vehicles will be complimentary, doing jobs more safely than humans can, such as very long distance highway driving, or removing humans from worksite applications in hazardous areas, such as blast furnaces, unstable demolition sites or underground mines. As with the creation of the car or the computer, this technology will for sure be a creator of many new jobs.”
What about the fear that some people have about driverless vehicles being let loose on highways and work sites? 
“Fear is never a good advisor, so as an industry we need to come together and address those concerns,” Jaeger said.
“Not only must autonomous solutions be safe, we must demonstrate it unequivocally to reassure the public. That’s not just product safety, but also protection against cybercrime interference, which we are also working hard on preventing. The irony here is that one of the biggest benefits of this technology is that it will improve safety and reduce harm. There is already a healthy debate going on, and we need to be better at spelling out that key benefit.”
Transport as a service
Autonomous vehicles offer more than a like-for-like switch with human operated machines, but rather whole new business models and customer relationships. 
Transport as a service is a growing trend, and tailoring fleets of machines to suit customers’ individual needs is a key element of Volvo Autonomous Solutions’ remit. 
“We see ourselves as an integrator of emerging technologies to create solutions, bundling hardware and software, and then if necessary, operating it on behalf of the customer,” Jaeger said.
Autonomous vehicles will be a service to wider society. There remains several mountains to climb before reaching the goal of reliable, productive, sustainable and safe autonomous transport solutions. But Jaeger remains undaunted.
“To ensure that it is understood as beneficial to society we need to master the componentry by proving that it is truly safe,” he said. 
“We also need to reassure legislators and promote the many benefits by being good stewards of this technology.”

“Autonomous cars will be here in 2 years” has been a standard sentence from the industry for the past 5 years or so. Now there is good reason to expect autonomous ride-hailing services to hit our roads within 3 years. So, what has happened in the last year in the world of autonomy to give this confidence boost?
 Well, a few things actually. Breaking the previous year down into the most significant advancements: COVID-19 has kick-started the next phase of autonomous testing, technology maturity continues to more than double year on year, sensor prices are coming down and performance is increasing, and there are genuine autonomous services available, just in very limited conditions. To mark Autonomous Vehicle Day, observed on May 31, this article examines progress in more detail.
The impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly had a devastating impact on the world over the past year or so. However, opportunity can often be found in the face of adversity, and this was the case for autonomy. At the beginning of the pandemic, the companies that had been testing autonomous services with safety/backup drivers behind the wheel (Waymo, Cruise, Baidu, Pony, etc.) were forced to cease testing. 
There was concern about the social contact between the riders and the safety drivers being a factor in spreading the pandemic. Here is where the opportunity was presented; it seemed that the safest way to continue testing was without the safety driver behind the wheel. In July 2020, AutoX became the first MaaS company1 to gain a driverless testing license, a world-first which allowed them to operate driverless vehicles in California. The new license type allowed them to operate a fully autonomous service in San Jose, limited to roads with a posted speed limit of 45mph or less. 
Following that, another six companies have been granted similar licenses in California and others have gained similar licenses for parts of China. COVID-19 may have been the catalyst needed to transition from safety-driver-based testing to fully autonomous testing. This is not to say that the industry was not ready for the transition, but the pandemic definitely put pressure on the governing bodies to progress to the next step.
Technology maturity
MaaS operators have been testing their autonomous solutions in California since 2015, and since then they have been publishing reports about the performance of their systems. The most important outcome from this data is the miles per disengagement metric, which describes the average distance an autonomous vehicle can travel without human intervention. IDTechEx‘s analysis of this data shows exponential growth in the miles per disengagement, with the figure more than doubling each year. 
By extrapolating this growth IDTechEx predicts that within 3 years autonomous vehicles will be performing more safely than the average American driver. IDTechEx even went one step further and found that within 25 years autonomous vehicles will be able to travel the same annual distance as the entire US fleet without a single disengagement. There are still obstacles to overcome, such as testing in more urbanized areas and the establishment of cost-effective sensor suites. Waymo and Cruise have recently gained permission to test in the urban centers of San Francisco which will help with the former.

The Polish micro-mobility operator launches its first e-bike sharing service from the city of Rzeszów, using smart vehicles designed and manufactured by the Italian company.
Polish micro-mobility operator Blinkee chooses VAIMOO smart e-bikes to debut its first shared e-bike service.
Blinkee, operating in 47 cities and 5 European countries with over 6,000 vehicles including moped, scooters and traditional bikes, launches its first e-bike sharing service with VAIMOO starting with a pilot project from the municipality of Rzeszów to be then extended to other Poland urban centers.
More in detail, the partnership between Blinkee and VAIMOO includes a first supply of smart e-bikes, fully developed and manufactured by the Italian company and equipped with connectivity technology that allows vehicles to be easily integrated with the management system of the Polish operator, which delivers in one APP fully electric mopeds, scooters and bicycles.
This operation will allow Blinkee to expand the current fleet of vehicles in full coherence with its strategy of delivering a multimodal offer, using the state-of-the-art e-bikes for sharing, already awarded at CES 2021 – Consumer Electronic Show, and perfectly integrable in a simple and fast way.
An important partnership that strengthens the international presence of VAIMOO and that, after the agreements and implementations in Copenhagen, Rotterdam and in the UK, confirms once again the validity of its highly innovative e-bikes and system, able to exploit the full potential of IoT technology to offer increasingly efficient, flexible, inclusive and integrated mobility services.
“We are very proud to cooperate with Blinkee – claimed Matteo Pertosa, founder and CEO of VAIMOO – this agreement gives us the opportunity to collaborate with an important European player in micro-mobility and represents another step in our growth strategy focused on the development of high-value mobility systems, integrated and tailored for smart cities”.
“Introducing a new generation of electric bikes to our offer is a realization of the concept of multimodal transportation for cities” – says Marcin Maliszewski, CEO of Blinkee. “In today’s world the most important values are health and time, and ecological bikes are the easiest and actually the only way to fight smog and traffic jams in metropolises” – he adds.
In this partnership, VAIMOO’s goals perfectly fit Blinkee’s strategy to create alternative transportation services that are safe, full accessible with low emissions and able to provide an innovative mobility experience.

Last month, self-driving technology company TuSimple shipped a truckload of watermelons across the state of Texas ten hours faster than normal. They did this by using their automated driving system for over 900 miles of the journey. The test drive was considered a success, and marked the beginning of a partnership between TuSimple and produce distributor Guimarra. This is one of the first such partnerships announced, but TuSimple may soon have some competition from another big player in the driverless vehicles game: Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Waymo.
Yesterday, Waymo announced a partnership with transportation logistics company JB Hunt to move cargo in automated trucks in Texas. The first route they’ll drive is between Houston and Fort Worth, which Waymo claims is “one of the most highly utilized freight corridors in the country.”
At around 260 miles long, much of the route is a straight shot on Interstate 45. The trucks will have human safety drivers on board who will likely take over some of the city driving portions, but the goal is to use the automated system as much as possible. A software technician will be on board as well, which makes sense given software will be doing the bulk of the driving.
Waymo has been testing driverless trucks in Texas since last August, when it established a hub in Dallas from which to deploy its fleet of 18-wheelers, complete with cameras, lidar, and on-board computers. It’s no coincidence that the Lone Star State is getting so much driverless action; its mild climate and vast highway network make for a lot of space to drive and a lot of time throughout the year to do so—and a 2017 bill allows vehicles to operate without a driver there.
There are five levels of automation in driving, or if you count level 0 (where there’s no automation at all and a human driver is fully in control at all times), six. At Level 5—full autonomy—the vehicle can drive itself anywhere (around cities, on highways, on rural roads, etc.) in any conditions (rain, sun, fog, etc.) without human intervention.
Waymo’s technology, called Waymo Driver (“the world’s most experienced driver,” if the company has its way) is considered Level 4, which means it could operate without a safety driver under certain conditions (namely, good weather). “This will be one of the first opportunities for JB Hunt to receive data and feedback on customer freight moved with a Class 8 tractor operating at this level of autonomy,” said Craig Harper, JB Hunt’s chief sustainability officer and executive vice president.
Despite looming concerns over job losses due to automation in trucking, proponents say that not only will self-driving technology help fill an ongoing shortage of drivers, it will improve safety on roads and decrease food waste, since shipments will arrive to their final destinations faster. JB Hunt, Harper said, believes “there will be a need for highly skilled, professional drivers for many years to come,” but autonomous technologies will improve efficiency and safety.
Whether it’s TuSimple, Waymo, or other players left to enter the field (or in this case, the state of Texas), it seems we’ll soon be finding out if that’s the case.

While the future of the automotive industry is still unwritten, here is what we know: Industry leaders will need to master connectivity to deliver the V2X (vehicle-to-everything) capabilities fully autonomous driving promises.
Autonomous driving is both an audacious visionary goal and a highly achievable feat of technical engineering. The race to launching the industry’s first fully autonomous car is accelerating, as technology companies like Apple and Waymo battle car companies Audi, Ford, Tesla, Renault, Waymo and ride sharing companies Lyft and Uber to overcome technical challenges and enable an entirely new way of driving that will surprise and delight users.
Who will win the race? And how will driverless cars transform society? While the future of the automotive industry is still unwritten, here is what we know: Industry leaders will need to master connectivity to deliver the V2X (vehicle-to-everything) capabilities fully autonomous driving promises. Here’s an overview of six key connectivity requirements to make that happen.
Architectures Must Be Redundant and Real-time
Autonomous driving will increasingly demand more and more reliable network-based structures, requiring redundant, real-time architectures. These architectures will organize high performance clusters in functional domains and be connected via a central gateway in a high-speed data backbone structure. Group sensors and actuators will be organized hierarchically.
Functional domains for connected, autonomous vehicles with high speed in-vehicle networks.
The Demand for High-Speed Data Will Only Increase
Driverless cars will have incredibly sophisticated systems, including high performance computers and an increasing number of advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) sensors, such as high-resolution stereo and/or mono cameras, RADAR, and LIDAR, as well as future human-machine interfaces (HMIs), such as large 4K/8K screens or head-up displays (HUDs).
These systems will generate vast amounts of data, which will require sophisticated electronic support, including high-speed data nodes, links, cables, and assemblies. The inside of the driverless car will literally be an information highway, and data streams will run in parallel or different directions. They’ll be managed in switched networks with sufficient margin to ensure the car’s safe operations.  
Car manufacturers will be required to continuously increase bandwidths for both point-to-point data pipes and distributed network structures to meet new data demands. Level 5 cars will send 25 gigabytes of data to the cloud every hour.
TE Connectivity (TE) has developed gigabit-speed networks that enable global automotive OEMs to meet these connectivity requirements. TE helps automotive leaders achieve their goals, by providing connectivity solutions that overcome myriad mechanical, electrical, and software protocol and interface compatibility challenges.

Safety and Other Applications Require External Connectivity
V2X communications must continuously capture and interpret complete data concerning the surrounding environment. Fully autonomous vehicles require all of this information to correctly execute actions such as braking or accelerating without driver assistance.
V2X communications uses both sensor technology and radio-based communication. Car sensors help vehicle systems interact with their immediate surroundings. Radio systems enable vehicles to exchange information with other vehicles and with traffic infrastructure such as lights, signs and tolls. These surroundings actively communicate their state and changing conditions around them to the vehicle. Thus, a light communicates that it is about to change from red to green, a sign indicates that the next turn-off is five miles ahead, and a vehicle a lane over communicates that it is about to signal and turn right. All of these signals make driving safer. Information on driving conditions, such as icy roads ahead, traffic slowdowns, or tolls, can also enable vehicles to interpret data and make automated decisions, such as choosing another route.
Drivers make decisions in split-seconds, and fully autonomous cars will, too. To be safe, fully autonomous driving requires real-time data transmission.  Current cellular radio standards such as LTE has a latency of 30 to 40 milliseconds, making it unsafe for driverless vehicles. 5G mobile communication, which will be available for deployment in 2019, will provide higher data rates of up to 10 Gbps with considerably lower latency than LTE, making it suitable for real-time safety applications.
Autonomous Driving Quality  and Reliability Are Non-Negotiable
In addition to being real-time, data sensing and transmission must be 100% reliable. What this means is that connectivity can’t fail because of bad road conditions, such as fog, snow, or ice, or extended use, such as thousands and thousands of hours of operation.
Vehicle manufacturers can achieve this goal by using highly robust automotive-grade connectivity systems, provided by competent and experienced suppliers with engineering and materials science expertise.  OEMs’ preferred suppliers must understand contact physics and the best materials for sound electromechanical connections and have built up the exacting manufacturing processes and tools to build them. 
Increasingly Electrified Cars Will Require a New Approach to Safety
Ensuring data integrity within functional safety applications is mandatory for autonomous driving, because human lives will depend on it. As data requirements grow, cars will increasingly electrify. Thus, it is essential to ensure safe data transport on the physical layer level and provide the highest possible physical and data security protections.
Automotive companies are investigating where and when they can use optical-fiber based connectivity to avoid electromagnetic interference.  Fiber optic communications do not experience electro-magnetic emissions, crosstalk, or signal distortion. This means optical communication network channels can be placed near high-power electric cables and devices and provide reliable functioning without safety concerns or interference worries.
Suppliers are also developing in-vehicle networks based on global automotive Ethernet standards which would carry encrypted data, rather than using proprietary and legacy networks where the data is vulnerable and un-encrypted. Adopting these standards would help prevent cars from being hacked and remotely controlled by a malicious actor.
Next-Generation Car Design Will Require Miniaturized Solutions
To fit V2X systems under the hood of a car, manufacturers will need to develop automotive-grade miniaturized and highly integrated connectivity solutions. Sensors and actuators are getting smaller as links increase.  
The Automotive Ethernet enables manufacturers to deliver both power and data over a single pair of wires, either shielded or unshielded.  TE Connectivity has significant experience in confirming the clearance and creepage margins necessary to accomplish this objective.
At the same time, manufacturers will need to determine and meet pollution and moisture tolerances for systems.  In-vehicle networks will need the lightest and leanest cable assemblies and connectors made yet – which will be placed in ever denser configurations.  TE is helping the automotive industry make these trade-offs and optimize their solutions, to make data traverse systems faster and in the most power-efficient way, but with less total material connector and cabling material.
Co-creating the Future of Mobility
Autonomous driving is changing the way we view vehicles and mobility. Next-generation cars will not just enable transportation: They will also enhance passenger safety, comfort, and entertainment. Imagine reclining in your car as you drive, holding videoconference meetings, sending emails, and finishing a project before you ever arrive at work.
Today, transportation is a necessary, but often painful process. With fully autonomous driving, passengers will be freed to accomplish their own goals, turning the dead hours of driving into fruitful hours of learning, working, engaging, and relaxing.
TE is at the forefront of fully autonomous driving innovation. For decades, we have teamed with automotive manufacturers to collaborate on connectivity solutions that set new industry standards. Today, we continue to collaborate with our customers to adopt the new standards and technology innovations and provide the connectivity that will power a new generation of cars.
TE provides a robust, comprehensive automotive data connectivity product portfolio with solutions that meet manufacturers’ requirements for function, safety, link type, chips, and cable type, as well as industry standards and OEM or Tier1 specifications. Plastic fiber optic solutions include MOST Connectors, which carry data at speeds up to 150Mbps, and a next-generation solution, which will enable data rates of 10 to 24 Gbps.

The need for fleet managers to stay connected to their fleet vehicles is an absolute must. Through installed sensors, managers can receive real-time data on GPS location, fuel consumption, telematics, and more. All of which help to improve their dispatch, route planning, and overall business logistics. Let’s take a look at how IoT solutions are transforming the fleet management industry.
How Does IoT Benefit Fleet Management?
IoT fleet management and asset tracking systems offer many benefits, driving increased efficiencies and better outcomes in several areas. Let’s take a closer look at a few. ‍
Safety
While earlier technology only monitored the vehicle’s location along a route, today’s IoT sensors can deliver much more detailed information to fleet operators. For example, they might monitor tire pressure and coolant temperature and be able to trigger an alert if there’s a problem. 
Access to this type of information gives fleet managers a heads up when a safety risk is detected—and if a part is on the verge of failure, they have time to intervene. In-vehicle sensors also deliver constant, valuable information to drivers, helping them make safer decisions.

‍IoT is likely to play an even bigger role in fleet management than it already has. Fleet managers: take advantage of IoT to stay ahead of your competition.Click To Tweet

Vehicle Maintenance
Similarly, IoT sensors can alert drivers and fleet managers to upcoming maintenance needs such as oil changes and tire rotations. Connected sensors can also be installed in the engine to provide insights about the function of essential parts, allowing companies to initiative preventive maintenance—fixing things before they break down completely.‍
Route Optimization
Advanced GPS systems detect traffic and weather conditions along a vehicle’s route and recommend alternate routes as needed. Fleet-wide, this cuts down on fuel consumption and yields other benefits in saved time and increased safety.‍
Cost Savings
‍IoT fleet management solutions provide companies with layers of useful data, which they can use to increase efficiencies around maintenance, routes, driver accountability, and more. All these optimizations ultimately yield cost savings as the company can run its operations in a much leaner, more effective way.‍
Current Challenges for IoT in Fleet Management
While IoT solutions are very successful in fleet management, adopting many sensors and data streams always presents some challenges. That includes data processing and analytics, system integration, and device management. As a solution, some SIM providers include comprehensive device management services to give you real-time visibility into device health, data limits, and usage.‍
Additionally, there are revolutionary applications of IoT in fleet management. Those applications impact fleet management in a variety of ways from monitoring driver behavior to predictive maintenance to big data analytics.  
Fortunately, there are several successful fleet management examples where companies have successfully implemented IoT solutions at scale:For example, Samsara’s fleet management solution includes GPS tracking and real-time compliance and safety information. Their AI dash cams capture incidents and enhances driver safety. 
The Future of IoT in Fleet Management
‍As we can see, there are major benefits to integrating IoT in fleet management, especially in terms of real-time tracking, monitoring driver behavior, and making data-driven decisions. IoT is likely to play an even bigger role in fleet management with time and has become common in large and small fleet deployments. Our advice for fleet managers: take advantage of IoT to stay ahead of your competition.

 Tapping into multiple services, both inside and outside a car, requires a rethinking of everything from architectures to security. 
 BY: ANN STEFFORA MUTSCHLER
Carmakers are reworking their electronic architectures so they can tap into a growing number of external services and internal options, similar to the way a data center taps into various services over its internal network.
In the past, this has been largely confined to internal services such as on-board Internet connectivity, and external traffic routing and music. The current vision is to greatly expand those offerings through faster internal and external communications. But making that all work will require changes on multiple fronts.
The complexity in chips and systems in vehicles is exploding even without considering these new services. Automotive OEMs and their suppliers have been gradually increasing the number of ECUs in vehicles, along with multiple millions of lines of code to enable new features and capabilities. Now, with increasing levels of assisted and autonomous driving being added, that complexity has skyrocketed, rendering the old approach unsustainable.
As competition heats up, the long-established tiered supplier ecosystem is starting to re-orient itself around what consumers want, some of which may be offered by automakers and some of which will become available as infrastructure is built up around vehicles. That includes smart cities, vehicle-to-infrastructure, and localized edge services, and it impacts how communications are structured within a vehicle, how that data traffic is prioritized, and how the compute infrastructure is partitioned. It also determines which ECUs get consolidated, how all of this is tied together within a vehicle, as well as the overall software-driven, service-oriented architectures (SOAs).
SOAs are relatively new in the auto sector because until recently it’s been a one-to-one match between the software and hardware from the Tier 1 or 2 supplier, and they could not be unbundled.
“That’s gone with the changes happening within the automotive ecosystem,” noted David Fritz, senior director for autonomous and ADAS at Siemens Digital Industries Software. “New vehicle architectures are designed to solve very complex problems and get around a lot of the supplier and technology limitations of existing vehicles to ask, ‘How in the world do we architect software to fit that?’ Engineering teams are used to modeling in MATLAB, pushing a button, having the tool generate some C code for their controller, then be done. In a service-oriented architecture (SOA), you don’t even know where that software is going to run. You don’t know if it’s going to run in a hypervisor. You don’t know whether or not you’re going to have full control of that microcontroller, or if something could be downloaded much later that could impact your performance. How in the world do you do that? This points back to digital twins that need to provide simulation results to indicate where the boundaries are. At the same time, the design of the whole system software architecture is dramatically different because it is dynamically allocated, not statically allocated, and meshed one-to-one to the hardware.”
Utilizing service-oriented architecturesAnother way to think about SOAs is in terms of the zonal architecture concepts that have been discussed more broadly in the industry.
For a service-oriented architecture, there are a few different ways to go about it, including a zonal approach. “When you look at the geography of the car, you have to consider how to chop things up,” said Kurt Shuler, vice president of marketing at Arteris IP. “As part of the ECU consolidation discussion, zonal can be one approach such that, for example, ‘the antilock braking system is usually next to this other subsystem, so let’s put those together, and we’ll make that one electronic system that’ll cover all that stuff.’ However, there are still some who say all of this is going to go together, like a centralized architecture where there is a common brain, which makes sense from a functional safety and redundancy standpoint.”
Zonal architectures are a big deal. “The whole automotive industry is moving to that new architecture because it’s required for autonomous driving to have a more centralized computing infrastructure, but also some distributed multi-purpose, zonal controllers that can take care of all the sensors, and so forth,” said Robert Schweiger, director of automotive solutions at Cadence. “In order to have this, you need high-speed in-vehicle communication, so Ethernet will evolve toward 10 gigabit very soon from 1 gigabit, where we are now. Also, the Automotive Service Alliance is putting its own standard in place for this, which is quite interesting because at the same time last year, MIPI released the MIPI A-PHYi, which should exactly address this thing. So now there are two competing standards going forward that will take us to 16 gigabit per second to solve the connectivity from the Ethernet network to the endpoints — the sensors, for instance — using SerDes type of communication. Within the cloud from ECU to ECU, or to the central computing unit, it will be definitely Ethernet. This means more OEMs will be adopting these high-speed communication standards, because it enables so many other things. With that, you need high-integration ECUs. The central compute units are really massive computers with very complex, very powerful SoCs sitting in the middle. Then, the zonal controllers, if they will be multi-purpose, smaller computing units, basically will evolve as an incarnation of the multiple consolidated ECUs that we have nowadays in the car.”
This is the general direction, but tradeoff discussions around how to structure the architecture are still evolving. Set in the context of Automotive Ethernet (AE) and the additional bandwidth that it brings, it is possible to boot up an entire vehicle using an SOA, with each individual components having its own boot flash.
“Here, it can come up and say, ‘I need access to these services, wherever those services are.’ It could be in the same printed circuit board, it could be on the other end of the vehicle, it could be anywhere, and it actually doesn’t matter where it is. Once you register for those services, if it’s monitoring, for example, a dashboard, there would be monitoring data sent to the speedometer and tachometer. The transmission could also send information,” Fritz explained.
From a functional standpoint, this requires a number of considerations. “With an SOA, a lot of functions are being virtualized that may have some interdependency,” Shuler said. “There could be some interdependency, or they could be completely independent of each other, running out of this single architecture. SOA essentially covers those two parts of the spectrum of where the processing is done, and then what is that processing, and what kind of services? What kind of capabilities does it provide to the vehicle and the overall system. This creates a conflict between, on one end, ‘I’m going to have a microprocessor for every function in the car,’ and ‘I’m going to run everything on a centralized mainframe.’”
It also has a ripple effect on other pieces of the system architecture.
“Whenever you’re dealing with software [like AUTOSAR], it’s great when you don’t have huge meta functions, and you’re able to slice these in there,” Shuler said. “But when there are huge functions, like for autonomous driving, this is where things get maybe more zonal/hierarchical. It’s a mother-daughter type system relationship between multiple aspects. And that’s from a hardware standpoint. There’s also a software brain controlling everything. But when you look at the actual hardware, it’s literally in different places. That’s because of modularity in the architecture based on the old subsystem approach. When there are different subsystems, you want to have some flexibility. There are starting to be more standards for data interchange and different types of processing, as well as the ability to do some pre-processing on the data. Then, instead of sending all the bits over, you can say, ‘Here’s this data format that shows what objects are over there, which could be from a lidar, radar, or camera, but the object classifications have to be there.”
There are a few ways automotive ecosystem players can start exploring SOA. The primary approach was borrowed from the robot industry, called ROS, or robot operating system.
“A few years ago, companies started applying the ROS service-oriented concept to prototype cars, and it’s still very new. Most people don’t even know that it’s needed, let alone exists, but it’s in a process of being reworked and revamped, and currently there are SOA architectures based on ROS,” said Siemens’ Fritz. “Early explorations into that highlighted the pros and cons, and we’re taking that now into the OEMs, saying, ‘Until you can sort out what you want, ROS is a really good place to start.’ The only question is, even if you’re using ROS, that’s kind of like the communication layer for an SOA. On top of that, you need semantic information. For instance, how do you find the right balance between what a smart city infrastructure does, and what the vehicle does onboard?”
Security concernsThere are security implications for smart city infrastructures interacting with a vehicle’s architecture, not all of which have been fully addressed.
“In the communication between cars and their surroundings, this brings up fundamental questions about performance and security,” Thierry Kouthon, technical product manager at Rambus Security said. “Here, security is mostly about authentication. You have to make sure that the car that is talking to you is actually a car, and that it is a genuine car from a genuine manufacturer, not some hacker, or some adversarial entity trying to send fake signals or jam your reactions. This requires public key cryptography in order for cars to authenticate each other, so I know that the 100 signals that I’ve received from all those cars that are surrounding me are from actual cars from Volkswagen, Mercedes, General Motors, etc.”
In order to do that, you need two things. First, a root of trust is essential to ensure that nobody can pervasively inspect the cryptographic processing, and the cryptographic operation while being processed.
“You need that on both sides,” Kouthon said. “In addition to the communication in the V2X context, security must be inside the vehicle itself. Modern cars are more like computers on wheels than what they were conceived of 50 years ago, for several reasons. A typical car contains 50 to 100 computers for steering, cruise control, entertainment, instrumentation, brake lights, you name it. It has a lot of components, with each of these components being computerized, and 70% of those components have been provided by suppliers to the OEM, not by the OEM itself. How do you make sure that everybody that is supplying something to you is genuine and that it’s not injecting the car with something malicious?”
Second, all these computers communicate via a network — the CAN bus — which is ubiquitous in cars, and typically is not featured with any security for cost reasons, Kouthon explained. “It’s not because the OEMs and Tier 1s don’t know how to make it secure. It’s because vehicle margins are slim. It’s a big bus. It’s a lot of wiring, and making it very secure will cost money, increase the car’s bill of materials, etc. The approach now is to put the security inside the electronic control units (ECUs), because each one of these ECUs has a computer inside the processor, and since we cannot secure the network between the processors, instead the processors are secured so that when they talk to each other, regardless of the communication medium, they can authenticate each other.”
For security in a smart city, it’s essentially about electronic warfare and countermeasures, and all devices utilized must be suited for those applications, said Willard Tu, director of automotive at Xilinx. “You want to make sure people aren’t spoofing your lidar or radar data, sending you misinformation. And that’s what happens in [a military] battle zone, and none of us want to think about it, but that’s what electronic countermeasures are trying to do — confuse your sensor array and take it over if possible.”
This is familiar ground for security, even though it’s an ongoing challenge. “Fundamentally, within those types of environments security always boils down into having base properties in place,” said Jason Oberg, CTO of Tortuga Logic. “You want to encrypt everything, making sure no one can steal the information. And then you want to make sure that all your information is signed and authentic, meaning that if I send something to another vehicle, or to a building, or to a sign or part of the infrastructure, that it’s authentically coming from me — and not an attacker on the side of the road with their laptop and an antenna, injecting material into the system that causes it to think it’s me, and then my car behaves differently. It sounds simple, but because everything is so distributed, it’s a mess of key management, and how to update who is who. How do I know that the keys that I have to say ‘I’m Jason,’ are the most up to date keys? Who’s the central owner of all that? On the Internet there are certificate authorities that say, ‘This is Google,’ so that when you go to Google, you can trust that it is Google. Everything that’s coming from them is signed. That same kind of infrastructure is needed for automobiles.”
All of this needs to be stored down at the hardware level in a vehicle. “In your laptop, you control it, unless someone steals it, and with infrastructure someone could just climb up a telephone pole and muck with something so it’s a different attack model,” Oberg said. “For this reason, it is really important to have everything routed down into the actual chip, and that’s where the root of trust is really important. Those keys need to be stored securely somewhere.”
Additionally, the level of communication that will be required to make it possible for vehicles to interface with any and all manner of infrastructure will be massive, and 5G is the obvious technology to enable it. That will ratchet up the need for edge computing, AI, and increased verification.
“The complexities involved with making sure these communications happen safely and securely will be astounding,” said Jorg Grosse, product manager for functional safety at OneSpin Solutions. “Formal verification will play a crucial role in the verification of the integrated circuits that will power this intelligent communication. The technology will go beyond simply making sure designs operate as intended. It also must ensure that safety and security vulnerabilities and weaknesses are eliminated.”
As smart cities evolve alongside autonomous developments, 5G is emerging as the common denominator.
“For V2X, they want to use 5G for the communications,” said Ron DiGiuseppe, automotive IP segment manager at Synopsys. “In fact, the 3GPP implemented specific features in 5G that would make it more useful for automotive, one of which is improved reliability, and of course, improved bandwidth. It’s important to make sure that if there’s also policy-based data rates, that they’ve added some prioritization. This means when data gets communicated over that 5G link, if someone in the back seat is streaming a movie for their rear seat entertainment, the last thing you want is that streaming data to interfere with the safety-critical data such as V2X or autonomous driving. 5G has specific features that allow it to prioritize the data. That helps for safety applications. When it comes to V2X and autonomous, the autonomous application uses 5G for that very high resolution mapping for the path planning, and the V2X uses 5G for the V2X communications. Then, the rear seat entertainment would be using 5G to stream the movie smoothly. This means we have to make sure both of those applications, the V2X and the autonomous — since they’ll both be running over 5G and need to share the bandwidth — will run simultaneously.”
Further, Grosse expects continuous product lifecycle verification to be adopted, as well, because there will be a wide range in the age of devices communicating with one another, while keeping up with the constant evolution of security requirements.
ConclusionGiven the complexity, and still-evolving SOA solutions, making the transition to SOA may be a nightmare.
“If you’re a traditional automotive player, you’re not used to dealing with a billion lines of code, or hundreds of millions of lines of code, or tens of millions of lines of code, but now you’re having to deal with that,” said Arteris IP’s Shuler. “If you’re a startup and you’re entering automotive, maybe you came over from some AI point of view. Or maybe you worked at a Qualcomm on digital baseband modems, and then you have all these other requirements, expectations, information sharing and things that you used to have 100% control over. Now you don’t, because of what your customers’ customer is saying is totally different. Everybody in the automotive ecosystem has to change. Traditional car suppliers have to get a little bit more flexible. The car companies have to learn to be more nimble, but that requires more risk. And then the folks who are coming into the industry from industries where risk was acceptable, they have to be more diligent about process and put in more bounding boxes.”

Innovation is at the forefront of smart and sustainable mobility development. An Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) can meet the urban mobility challenges head-on. Cities can reinvent their transit networks using ICTs and IoT-enabled platforms to build smart mobility systems that offer creative, tech-driven solutions for different mobility operations, including traffic management, parking management, etc. Let’s find out which cities have the smartest transport.
ITS systems have already optimized several city transit networks through a technical and organizational overhaul. But, in particular, the following four cities have witnessed an incredible smart mobility transformation.
1. Barcelona, Spain
First up on the list is Barcelona! This city has often emerged as the world’s smart mobility leader, thanks to the wide-scale implementation of IoT systems in the city’s transportation infrastructure. Every street in Barcelona has LED-based streetlights connected to a network of sensors.
These sensors can measure temperature, pollution, foot traffic, etc. to adapt to dynamic traffic needs and cut down on energy usage during off-peak hours. This network of smart streetlights complements the city’s intelligent traffic light network that provides special “green light,”traffic-less routes for emergency services like ambulance, fire trucks, etc.
In Barcelona, smart car parks are the bedrock of the city’s mobility sector, generating a revenue of 36.5 million Euros annually. The city’s smart parking system uses wireless sensors embedded beneath the roads to guide drivers to vacant parking spots via Smartphone apps, saving both time and fuel lost to cruising. And parking facilities charge demand-based tariffs for enhanced revenue generation.
Furthermore, Barcelona’s enviable bus transit system is the smartest in the world. The city’s bus network uses an orthogonal grid scheme to promote intermodality i.e., combining different modes of smartest transport for seamless mobility. Every bus stop placed strategically to provide a connection between bus lines, tram lines, bicycle lanes, metro lines, etc. These bus stops are equipped with interactive touch screens that run on solar energy to display bus arrival timings.
2. Vienna, Austria
Renowned for its imperial sites, cozy café houses, and wine taverns, the city’s smart transit system also adds to the Viennese charm. Vienna relies on multimodal and cooperative systems to deliver seamless citywide connections. While cycling and walking are encouraged here, residents can also leverage a transparent bike-sharing network, pedestrian zones, and dedicated travel lanes to curb carbon emissions and road congestion. No wonder, Vienna has been leading the “quality of life” index since 2008.
Meanwhile, significant investments in public transits engineer Vienna’s drive to lower Motorized Individual Traffic (MIT) in the city – by 2025, it aims to decrease the MIT amount by 20%. Vienna’s enviable public transport network sprawls the entire city with five underground metro lines, 29 tramway lines, and 127 bus lines.
City’s metro system transports 1.3 million commuters every day while most of the city’s population lives within 300m or less from several public transits. Most of these services are easily navigable through the Smartphone app called ‘Quando.’ Commuters get updates about the next subway train, bus departures, and tram routes for easy travel route mapping.
In the city’s goal to become more “livable,” advanced technical provisions in public transits are available to those with special needs. They can use multi-sensor guidance systems, custom-designed route planners for hassle-free commutes. Thanks to such technology-enabled features, Vienna boasts of the smartest transport network.
3. Tokyo, Japan                
Tokyo is home to over 10 million people, yet moving around the city is remarkably simple and easy. The city hosts efficient, IoT-enabled railway lines and bullet trains that can go up to 600 Km per hour for faster citywide trips; Tokyo’s Yamanote Line, a loop line that runs around the metropolitan’s center, can speedily transport 34 million passengers per week.
Payment for public transits is secure, thanks to IC cards. An IC card is a prepaid, rechargeable card that can be used to pay fares on public transports and at several shops, restaurants, convenience stores, and vending machines. Pasmo and Suico are the IC cards for Tokyo’s railway, bus, and subway users. Easy to top up, these smart cards are incredibly convenient for traveling around the city.
Japan’s public transportation systems, primarily its railway system, operates using smart IoT technology. The public transit systems undergo a “condition-based maintenance” wherein data is collected and analyzed to check equipment status. Based on the intelligence received, railway operators identify weaknesses, schedule repairs, or predict operational issues to reduce the number of maintenance closures.
To facilitate smart applications for public use, Tokyo uses an open public platform called Cpass.io that connects the IoT devices, several sources of big data, and government data together. A Cpass allows Tokyo’s local government and other government bodies to share data with the public and other businesses. The data shared includes the number of vehicles in the city, accidents, traffic flow, etc. to encourage technological applications for public use.
4. London, United Kingdom
In London, 2 million people ride the “Tube” every single day. Being one of the world’s oldest and busiest subway systems, the London Tube meets its maintenance and operational needs via smart mobility solutions. The Tube’s sprawling matrix uses network-enabled sensors embedded in CCTV cameras, PA loudspeakers, subway tunnels, etc. that help collect operational data.
Then, central control centers use the accumulated data to monitor equipment issues and deploy maintenance teams to make quick repairs and avert maintenance-based delays. Additionally, Transport for London (TFL) – Greater London’s local body responsible for transportation – provides free Wi-Fi on the underground networks to track user’s journeys from start to finish and analyses collected data to improve the efficiency of the subway system.
Furthermore, London developed a Heathrow Pod system to handle the road congestion caused by heavy traffic flow at the city’s Heathrow airport. It is a zero-emission, rapid transit system that uses Heathrow Pods (a fleet of automated, driverless electronic vehicles) to transport customers between airport terminal 5 and the business car park in just 5 minutes. The system consists of 21 public pods in total, eliminating the need for bus travel.
What tops all this is that most of London’s smart mobility projects are user-friendly. For instance, London initiated the “Transport for London Platform” that allows people to plan their journeys through multi-modal smart mobility options online. Users can book a trip in the cable car, rent a bike, navigate travel routes, etc. on said platform, facilitating smoother trips around the city.
The Need of the Hour
The Smartest transport solutions are necessary for curbing the cities’ mobility challenges. Besides, new, innovative, and data-driven intelligent mobility solutions can accrue long-term economic and environmental value to municipalities, policymakers, businesses, and, most of all, to travelers. After all, the primary objective of the smartest transport system is to enhance city life quality.

 The startup is set to begin production in 2022, with United Airlines as one of its first customers. 
 By  Chris YoungJun 11, 2021   
A California-based startup called Archer Aviation unveiled a “fully autonomous” electrical vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxi called Maker during a live event on June 11, with first flights planned for later this year, the company explained in a press statement.
The Maker aircraft is a prototype, which Archer will use to perform tests in order to gain certification. The company hopes to eventually build a larger production eVTOL aircraft for commercial intracity transportation.
Much like Volocopter’s recently revealed VoloConnect aircraft, the Maker launches using vertical facing rotors before transitioning to fixed-wing flight like that of a plane, reaching speeds up to 150 mph (240 km/h).
The 3,300-lb (1496 kg) craft features a 40-foot (12.2 m) wingspan on which 12 rotors are placed, in a design typical of other eVTOL prototypes.
The difference here, according to a report by CNET, is that the aircraft uses six large, five-bladed props that provide most of the lift, as well as six smaller, two-blade rotors that are only used when the aircraft is hovering and cruising.
By combining the larger rotors with smaller ones with a lower “tip speed,” Archer said its aircraft is 100 times quieter than a traditional helicopter, making it ideal for urban spaces. To be precise, the Maker hums at around 45 decibels (dB) when cruising at around 2,000 feet — an average helicopter would typically let off approximately 87 dB of sound.
First commercial flight could be as early as 2024
The Maker utilizes six independent battery packs, each with a capacity of 75 kWh, and it can rapidly recharge its batteries in just 10 minutes.
Though Archer Aviation said Maker will be “fully autonomous,” it will have a human pilot for safety purposes, as well as space for four passengers.

Archer Aviation envisions one of its aircraft’s services as shuttling VIP passengers from airports to city center in a short amount of time — it could get from San Francisco Airport to San Jose in only 17 minutes, for example.
Archer expects to complete its first Maker test flight during Q4 of this year. United Airlines has already announced plans to buy $1 billion worth of the company’s upcoming air taxi, in a bid to reduce its carbon footprint. The first commercial flights could launch in 2024 in Los Angeles and Miami — a little after Volocopter aims to launch its own air taxis in Paris and Singapore.

CEO and co-founder Hemant Sikaria had the light bulb moment to start Sibros when he had to make multiple trips to his car dealer due to a software recall. Upon further research, he realised the majority of OEMs did not have the necessary capabilities for advanced full vehicle updates. In fact, global OEMs have been facing significant software and data complexity challenges as vehicles were increasingly shifting towards electrification and self-driving modes. 
Synergising Hemant’s experience at Tesla in building systems that could solve these problems with Over-the-Air (OTA) programming, and Mayanks’s significant contributions to the software, data and battery management systems at Faraday, the duo teamed up to form Sibros.
Analytics India Magazine got in touch with the founders to understand how Sibros is leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to help automakers build new connectivity use cases and business models.
Leading The Way With ML
The advancement in 5G technology along with software-defined vehicles has allowed Over-the-Air software updates to extend beyond just telematics and head unit applications. As a matter of fact, the connected car revolution has made OTA software an industry standard for automakers. For the uninitiated, OTA can reduce consequential software recalls to create new revenue opportunities, and enhance the customer experience by shortening the time required to update, fix, and maintain vehicles throughout their entire lifecycle.
Sibros’ flagship product, OTA Deep Updater executes full vehicle Over-the-Air (OTA) software updates while logging vital vehicle data in real-time from every sensor and microchip. The solution supports any vehicle platform, architecture and hardware, starting from two to four wheelers, commercial trucks/busses to electric, and internal combustion to hybrid vehicles. 
Explaining the process, Hemant stated: Sibros collects data at the edge that is processed with machine learning and artificial intelligence to help automakers build new connectivity use cases, and business models, like variable insurance, driver personalisation, fixing software recalls overnight, crash detection, etc.
With its modular system that provides full vehicle OTA updates to every sensor or engine control unit (ECU) while logging real-time vehicle data, Sibros’ deep connectivity platform really stands out in the market. “As modern vehicles can produce petabytes of data monthly, Sibros selectively capture the most meaningful data based on customisable events and triggers. This data is then further compressed and uploaded to the cloud backend,” explained Hemant. “This method enables efficient cloud computing throughput and enables OEMs to leverage live vehicle data for fleet/service management, developing new connected apps, building third party marketplaces and much more.” 
The company uses machine learning, data pipelines and IoT to abstract, process and interpret vehicle data, such as fault codes, into human-readable formats on visual dashboards. “Our efforts on the AI and analytics front are all geared towards improving capabilities around safety measurement, failure detection and preventative maintenance,” said Mayank. “We offer insights into driving behaviour of each user on the platform by combining vehicle data such as speed or harsh acceleration and braking with external data sources like traffic, data and time.”
Sibros OTA Deep Updater can also automatically detect vehicle movement risks by flagging abnormalities in a vehicle’s manoeuvring patterns. Component usage like blending weather, altitude and region information, battery health, and performance also play a crucial role in providing insights to automakers for determining the optimal configuration of a battery in different markets.
Sibros’ core technology stack leverages Golang as the primary backend language to handle high currency workloads, with an outstanding balance between performance and developer velocity. However, for the frontend, the company leveraged React.js and React Native to deliver the product to multiple platforms without having to rewrite the stack from scratch. “We also heavily leverage cloud-native solutions including SQL/No-SQL and Kubernetes for container orchestration to avoid reinventing the wheel, and build our infrastructure as code using Terraform,” said Mayank.
COVID Impact
“While initially, the COVID pandemic has ground the automotive industry to a halt, slowing the progress with plants shutting down, the things have now started to pick up slowly, and we see a tremendous uptick in business traction,” said Hemant. SEE ALSO
As remote working and contactless interactions are becoming the new norm, Sibros was able to deliver an embedded software and cloud/analytics solution remotely. The solution is also enabling field technicians not to be physically present while performing R&D and testing the beta vehicles. “As our solution is designed to enable fully Over-the-Air remote services, this ultimately benefits end customers to limit their exposure for visiting a dealer for servicing or utilising new connected services, such as in-vehicle payments for goods/food/tolling/parking,” added Hemant.
Despite COVID, Sibros has been able to build a diverse and inclusive work culture. The employees can work directly with clients in their initial months to see their ideas become a reality in their product roadmap and offerings. “Our current and future job requisitions span the gamut — from embedded firmware engineers and full-stack engineers to UI/UX, sales and marketing. We look for people who are coachable and rising stars, instead of necessarily looking for specific skill sets,” said Hemant.
Wrapping up
Sibros currently has presence in multiple locations and is engaged with the largest Indian OEMs of two, three, and four wheeler vehicles. The founders believe that India is a high growth area for Sibros in terms of talent acquisition and building a customer base. The country holds great promise for the future of major automotive trends, particularly in areas of rapid charging infrastructure and EV production/adoption, they said.
The company has grown to over 40 employees and has raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by Nexus Venture Partners. “Our customer base includes the vehicle manufacturers directly spanning some of the world’s largest funded EV startups to some of the biggest makers of two and four-wheeler vehicles,” added Hemant.
Speaking about the company’s five-year plans, Hemant said Sibros intends to enter other verticals where the technology can be applied with minimal changes. “We also plan to stand up a centre of excellence in Pune as well as expanding our presence in Germany, Japan and China. Our vision is that in five years, the connected vehicle ecosystem will become a mainstream reality, powered by Sibros. Much like smartphone ecosystems gave birth to disruptive services and apps such as Uber or Airbnb, so will the vehicle ecosystem. It’s moving rapidly, and we expect to gain much progress over the next five years to accomplish this vision,” he added.

Transportation management systems are key to managing Supply chain disruptions, shifting capacity, fluctuating fuel costs and demanding e-commerce customer requirements.
Most of us recall store shelves emptied of cleaning and paper products in the early days of the pandemic. While many shortages were steadily corrected, the supply and demand imbalance “brought transportation to the board room, and not for the right reasons,” says Shane Duncan, vice president of shipper solutions with freight marketplace Transfix. To address transportation challenges, shippers need to be able to pivot when issues arise.
A transportation management system (TMS) can help by bringing “structure to chaos,” Duncan says. For instance, a TMS might deploy dynamic routing guides that adjust with the market, providing flexibility and additional capacity when needed.
What exactly is a TMS? It’s a platform that uses technology to help businesses plan, execute, and optimize the movement of goods, says Daniela Hendricks, chief compliance and process officer with logistics provider Gebrüder Weiss. A TMS also can ensure shipments comply with regulations and include required documentation.
Current TMS solutions offer more capabilities than those of even a few years ago. For instance, today’s rating engines are expected to include multiple transportation modes, and TMS platforms’ increasing need to integrate with a range of other parties, including carriers and brokerages, says Jeff Lokant, director of technology operations with logistics management company Transportation Insight.
DRIVING INTEREST
Several shifts in the business world have boosted interest in TMS solutions. The pandemic highlighted both the volatility and importance of the transportation function. Many TMS platforms can provide routing optimization, visibility, traceability, and other capabilities that businesses need to compete in a post-pandemic landscape, says Sebastian Valencia, partner with Clarkston Consulting.
The shift to cloud-based TMS solutions is accelerating the “democratization of TMS,” says Bart De Muynck, vice president and analyst with research firm Gartner. By providing automation and a single source of information with a nominal upfront investment, these solutions can offer value to even small shippers.
Like smartphones, TMS solutions also are becoming more open, says Fab Brasca, global vice president, global solutions with Blue Yonder. Their value comes not just from the solution itself, but from the “ecosystem” of applications they work with. Say a TMS provides coverage for road, but not ocean shipments. Increasingly, TMS solutions can connect with other providers to offer the capabilities they lack.
A TMS’s ability to eliminate paper files, while also storing and sharing shipment information electronically, has also become “a must in any TMS software during this pandemic,” Hendricks says.
Newer TMS solutions are built on “microservice architecture” that allows for easier integrations with other solutions through application programming interfaces (APIs). “It’s like the old Burger King model: ‘Have it your way,'” Lokant says, and select from more choices when integrating with other applications.
CONSIDERING A TMS
Given the democratization of TMS solutions, do they make sense for all organizations, big and small? “Size isn’t the key determining factor,” Valencia says. More relevant are the importance of managing transportation costs and/or meeting customer expectations. If these run high, even many small companies can justify investments in TMS solutions.
Also consider the ability of a TMS to enhance decision-making through improved intelligence, such as figuring out the best way to move 1,000 different products. A TMS also makes sense when manual processes have become bottlenecked and inefficient.
Before evaluating a specific TMS solution, here’s some advice:
Review your own operations. Consider your size and organizational structure, industry, the modes of transportation you use, and the degree to which you operate internationally, De Muynck advises. Say you move only domestic over-the-road shipments. A cloud solution geared to small operations may suffice.
Understand the pricing model to avoid surprises. Some TMS solutions charge per module and some per transaction.
Assess the software’s user-friendliness. “A TMS should be intuitive and allow the user to get rates and create shipments fairly easily,” says Kate Leatherbury, director of domestic transportation solutions with Gebrüder Weiss. To boost operational efficiency, the TMS should facilitate connectivity with other operating systems, as well as business partners.
Evaluate the TMS’s ability to accurately represent network constraints. For instance, North America is home to many mammoth distribution centers, so it’s easy to take dock capacity for granted, Brasca notes. Distribution facilities tend to be smaller in some other parts of the world. A solution has to recognize the constraints to accurately plan capacity. It also should be able to distinguish between, for example, the time required to load trucks with pallets versus boxes.
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT
Even as TMS solutions continue to advance and offer value to a broader range of organizations, there’s still room for improvement. It’s hard to find a single application that can cover all services with the depth most organizations need, in all regions of the world, Valencia says. Shippers often patch together multiple solutions to get all the capabilities they need.
Acquisitions are helping some companies incorporate more capabilities within a single platform. One example is MercuryGate’s recent acquisition of Cheetah Software. In its announcement, MercuryGate indicated the acquisition extends its platform to include last-mile, parcel, and LTL capabilities, among others.
LOOKING AHEAD
TMS solutions of the future will increasingly incorporate technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). “AI is not just a buzzword,” Lokant notes.
For the moment, however, the industry resides in “AI 1.0,” and many companies need more mature underlying data sets before AI solutions can “enrich a mainstream value proposition,” he says.
In another shift, a broader approach to problem-solving is gradually replacing the supply chain’s traditionally siloed focus, Brasca says. For this to continue, TMS solutions need to be more interoperable. “The TMS needs to be aware of other parts of the supply chain,” he says.
The TMS industry also is moving to a “TMS-as-a-Service” model, rather than the perpetual license model that has been the norm.
Even as TMS solutions continue to improve, many businesses can benefit from investing in one sooner than they typically have. “Businesses stand to gain a significant competitive advantage if they consider investing in a TMS solution much earlier in their digital journey,” Valencia says.

BlackBerry had its annual analyst event last week where its CEO John Chen explained something I thought was very provocative about the future the company anticipates.
It has to do with far broader interoperability, unique dependencies, and a level of potential security risk that most other technology firms aren’t yet considering. What if our coming wave of autonomous vehicles can connect to any IoT device?
Our Frightening Autonomous IoT Future
I could have titled this our fascinating, exciting, or unforgettable autonomous IoT future but, other than BlackBerry, no one seems to be focused on the security problems that this future will bring with it. We are creating an ecosystem where cars and robots are autonomous and connected so they will be able to connect to other devices, sensors, and data repositories available to them.
Companies like Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm have been talking about the massive amount of training, sensors, and AI technology going into cars and the C-V2X capability for these vehicles to communicate with each other and the smart city ecosystems they will be traveling.
Capabilities like using other car sensors to identify threats they can’t yet see are standard in demonstrations. But what about all the cameras popping up around the car? Cars will have layers of sensors from LiDAR (light detection and ranging) to cameras (including infrared) that will be able to see better than you can in all kinds of weather situations; and they’ll be fully trained on how to deal with anything they see.
But smart cities will have their cameras, sensors, and huge data lakes of information that cars could also use to see things out of their range.
For instance, if a child runs toward the street, the car cameras might not see them yet, but the security camera on the house, store, or office building might. Cars routed to pass down that street would, if they connected to that camera, get an alert that a hazard was about to enter the street that should be avoided. They might even get identifying information that would determine if that hazard is a child, dog, cat, or object in motion; and from that information the car could better anticipate and avoid hitting it.
Let’s extend this to where street sensors could report ice or water on the road, which could pose a danger depending on how fast the car is going and what type of tires are on the vehicle. Gunshot sensors could warn cars away from dangerous areas. Historical crime data could also help guide vehicles around areas where carjackings and other forms of crime, particularly dangerous to passengers, make travel unacceptably dangerous.
Now imagine if some hostile actor was able to take control of any number of these sensors. They could force the car into unsafe areas, they could cause the car to slow, and rather than avoid a carjacker serve itself up to one. Instead of sending the car a safe route, they could provide it with a very unsafe direction.
BlackBerry’s Solution
What John Chen seemed to be talking about was a future solution from BlackBerry that would establish a zero trust network for these devices and the autonomous vehicles, robots, drones, and other things that make use of the data.
This zero trust environment would provide a comprehensive way to secure IoT devices, secure the data coming from them (both in-transit and at rest) and aggressively protect the autonomous things using that data from being compromised by malware.
While we are likely at least five years from all of this coming together. The effort to secure this autonomous/IoT solution is arguably more important than the effort to create it. We are anticipating a substantial reduction in automobile-related deaths once autonomous driving becomes viable.
But suppose those vehicles and the data they use aren’t secured. In that case, we could see an expansion of the Tesla crashes thus far caused by poor driver decisions to use a technology that isn’t ready for autonomous driving.
The Danger of Mixed Messages
Right now, autonomous driving isn’t that popular. Concerns about the technology indicate that adaption will lag optimums significantly over the next decade or so because people don’t trust the tech. We saw during the pandemic that mixed messages from the CDC on masks, and concerns about blood clots, which are incredibly infrequent, are causing people to distrust the vaccines.
The significant number of drivers that have died in Teslas while allegedly using autopilot has grown substantially, and each crash seems to get front-page coverage. These crashes are mainly being caused by Tesla drivers who think they have an autopilot. Still, that capability won’t arrive until we have Level 4 or 5 autonomous systems. Tesla cars currently range from Level 2 to 2+, and they lag Cadillac in terms of the system’s performance while calling it Autopilot.
Since I was a kid, we’ve told the story of the first significant cruise control accident and how it was caused by someone who didn’t know what cruise control was, renting an RV, and being told it was like an autopilot. So he set the cruise control, went back to make some coffee, and ended up in a massive crash. Elon Mush either never heard that story or has some weird desire to see how many people he can get to crash their cars by using the same method.
In much the same way that the CDC mixed messages and blood clot reports adversely impact the vaccine rollout, these crashes are scaring people away from autonomous cars before they are even ready.
The same as we need a critical mass of people vaccinated so we can get to herd immunity, we need a critical mass of people using autonomous cars; so we can reduce the 38,000 people who are killed, and the 4.4 million who are injured seriously enough to require medical attention in car accidents each year on U.S. roadways to numbers far closer to zero.
If you buy an autonomous car, it will make you safer. But if a critical mass of people buy the technology, assuming it works, only then do cars because genuinely safe. I often wonder if Elon Musk has some self-destructive condition — or doesn’t like people — because there is no reason to call a technology Autopilot before Level 4 autonomous driving is reached.
Consumer Reports has been trying to get him to change the name of this feature until it can do what the name implies, but he hasn’t. Check out this video for more about that:
A couple of weeks ago, two more people allegedly died as a result. Tesla disputes the cause. Nonetheless, Tesla death numbers are very troubling given the car is built like a tank.
People who drive a Tesla are often the upper class which includes politicians. Both the EU and the U.S. have handed out fines in the billions to tech companies in the past. I wish Musk would stop using the name Autopilot to save lives. But even if he stopped only to avoid a huge fine, I expect the result would be beneficial to Tesla drivers, the Tesla company, and the future of autonomous driving.
Wrapping Up
Autonomous cars and the related robots and drones coming out of applied AI promise to transform the world into something pretty amazing. Companies like Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm are working furiously to create an extraordinary level of technology that will keep us safer and massively reduce the significant number of people killed or crippled in car accidents. Each has elements of security surrounding their efforts.
Still, it may be BlackBerry’s focus on security — the environment that these autonomous, connected things operate in — that will provide the most significant level of protection.
But these companies and their efforts will have reduced success if Elon Musk doesn’t stop referring to his offerings as having autonomous driving capabilities that are greater than the car is capable of providing yet. Overpromising and underdelivering on a technology that can save or take lives is incredibly foolish and damaging to the overall effort.
If the government begins hitting Tesla and Musk with huge fines, or people, over time, connect the Telsa brand to death, it won’t bode well for Tesla. There is no upside to implying you have autonomous driving before you have it. It just gets people killed.
When autonomous driving truly arrives, it could be excellent. But only if people trust it enough to implement it in numbers significant enough to reach critical mass — and only if the entire ecosystem that the vehicles operate in is secure and capable of doing the job. We aren’t there yet — and Musk, one of the leading pioneers of technology, is making things worse, not better.
If we want the better future that autonomous cars promise, everyone on the critical path to success needs to be on the same page. That isn’t the case yet, which will push adoption out farther than it needs to be.

Drivers could also buy longer range, more performance, or entertainment while charging
 By JIL MCINTOSH   
Volkswagen has been working on self-driving electric vehicles for a while, but now there’s a new twist: The company may let you sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride after you’ve paid for a monthly subscription.
Thomas Ulbrich, a member of Volkswagen’s board, told the German newspaper Die Welt that subscription features will start showing up in the second quarter of 2022 on vehicles in the company’s ID line of all-electric vehicles. He suggested autonomous driving, when it’s finally available, would be priced at €7 per hour – just over 10 Canadian loonies, although there’s no word when such a service might start up over here.
Ulbrich also mentioned possible subscriptions for increases to EV range or performance, or for entertainment features, such as video games, to pass the time while waiting for the vehicle to recharge. 
Zellmer, Volkswagen’s chief sales officer, implied that by offering a subscription for services when they’re finally available, drivers could opt for a lesser-priced vehicle now and then spend a small hourly amount in future when they want to be autonomously driven, rather than pay much more now for a vehicle with the self-driving feature built into the price, but not yet fully operational — an obvious swipe at Tesla.
But if buying a few hours of your vehicle’s self-driving ability keeps your prices down, it’ll still add up to what could potentially be vast millions of euros for Volkswagen. According to Die Welt, the German automaker will offer several digital services to ID drivers, as it transitions from simply a carmaker into a mobility provider.
Volkswagen’s software development subsidiary, originally called Car.Software Organisation and since renamed Cariad, created a cloud-based automated driving platform working with Microsoft, and purchased a camera software business from Hella. The company said about 10 per cent of the Volkswagen Group’s software code is written in-house, but plans are to increase software development to 60 per cent internally by 2025.
Volkswagen certainly isn’t alone in exploring subscription-based features as a way of increasing revenue. In the past, Tesla charged owners to “unlock” the highest performance in some Model S cars, while BMW briefly charged owners in the past to access Apple CarPlay, and has mulled over the idea of subscriptions to keep features such as heated seats or adaptive cruise control operative once a trial period runs out.

Tesla (TSLA) is looking at a more-than-decent chunk of a market valued at $1.2 trillion with its upcoming Tesla Network, a new Uber-like ride-hailing service with autonomous electric cars, according to Ark Invest.
For years, Tesla has taunted a ride-hailing app to be powered by its self-driving system. It’s been dubbed the “Tesla Network.”
The new product is dependent on Tesla solving computer vision to deploy its full self-driving system.
In case it does happen, which CEO Elon Musk has been claiming it will this year, investors have been trying to value the extremely disruptive new product.
Ark Invest, a Tesla shareholder, has been trying to put some numbers on the value potential of such a service in its Big Ideas 2021 report.
The group believes that autonomous ride-hailing platforms will generate over $1 trillion in earnings by 2030:


Now the big question is, Who is going to take the bigger share of this insanely large market?
Ark agrees with Musk that Tesla’s vision-based approach is the most scalable one:
Tesla’s approach is camera-based. With less accurate sensors than LiDAR, making the pathto full autonomy a more difficult problem to solve, cameras do not rely on HD maps and should enable a much more scalable service. Tesla’s could be the first autonomous taxi network to scale nationally.
While competitors like Waymo have already launched commercial autonomous ride-hailing services, they believe that the approach is too difficult to scale and will limit the growth:

However, Ark is not as optimistic as Musk when it comes to Tesla launching this service anytime soon. In the report, Ark assigns a 30% probability of Tesla launching its autonomous ride-hailing service in 2022.
But if it does happen, Tesla will take over the market a lot faster:
If Tesla launches its autonomous ride-hailing service successfully in 2022, Ark estimates adoption could approach 20% by 2025. If Waymo or GM is successful, adoption probably will be limited to 1% during the next five years.

The group believes that many are underestimating the impact of autonomous ride hailing, which could undercut human-driven ride hailing by 90% in the US and 50% in China.
Ark estimates a cost of 25 cents per mile for the consumer, which would drastically reduce the cost of personal transportation and expand the market.
Electrek’s Take
In general, I tend to agree.
With every cent per mile that you can shave off the cost of transportation, you drastically increase the market, and autonomous electric vehicles would shave off a few dozen cents per mile.
It will have an extremely disruptive impact on the entire transportation industry.
Most experts currently see Waymo and Cruise as leaders due to their autonomous services are already in operation in San Francisco and Phoenix.
Tesla is not too worried about that because it always believes that its vision-based strategy would enable them to leapfrog those companies who will have a much tougher time expanding the service to other markets. That’s because they require extensive mapping and maintenance of new markets before launching.
But there’s a lot of doubts around Tesla actually solving the vision problem.
 I think Ark’s 30% probability is a safe assumption for now, but that might change after we see Tesla FSD v9 in just a few weeks.

Health care organizations have long struggled with issues related to the shipping and receiving of critical medical supplies. The surge in e-commerce orders, however, has served to exacerbate these problems.

By Kimberly Whitehead and John W. Frazier
Consumers have embraced e-commerce—drawn to the convenience and efficiency of having their purchases delivered right to their doorstep. But the rise in e-commerce has not been beneficial to everyone.
At a health care conference in 2019, a darker and more troubling picture emerged.During a session titled “E-commerce,” complaints arose from almost everyone in the room. “How are we going to get these carriers to understand what they are doing to us?” asked the session speaker. Someone stood and said, “They act like we are not even there. They just drive by my dock.” Another said, “I have the drivers’ cell phone numbers, and I call and beg them to deliver to us first, every day. But it doesn’t always work.” From the back of the room came a booming voice, “I had a patient on the table, but his new heart valve was somewhere in the back of a truck.” He paused, “We had to send the patient home.” A woman in the front of the room said, “Even when they stop, they can’t always find my delivery. There are so many boxes, so many crammed into their trucks. Last week, a driver had to leave and come back later when he found my delivery. By that time, it was too late, the item had expired.” “What are we going to do?” asked the speaker in dismay.
The additional stress on the parcel carriers to deliver more and more packages directly to consumers is well known. The health care materials managers at the conference felt confident that the rise in these e-commerce shipments was contributing to their sense of neglect from their parcel carrier partners and the difficulties they were having efficiently receiving vital deliveries. They told us that they would sometimes have to stand at the back of a truck and look for their package with the driver, searching through piles of boxes that were headed to households.
The comments we heard at the conference led us to investigate if these were isolated incidents or if other health care organizations (HCOs) were experiencing the same problems. Our subsequent research indicates that these managers are, in fact, not alone. Instead, executive interviews and survey responses revealed that last-mile delivery problems are widespread at HCOs across the United States. The results were clear: Health care organizations are on the verge of a logistics crisis, and they need help.
A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT
Health care plays a major role in the U.S. economy. In 2018, health care made up 17.5% of the United States’ gross domestic product (GDP) or $3.6 trillion,1 and logistics expenses for HCOs exceeded 25% of their overall budget.2 Health care logistics itself is a significant portion of the United States’ GDP at approximately 4.4%.
HCO logistics costs are driven in part by the large number, variety, and complexity of stock-keeping units (SKUs) an HCO must manage. The number of SKUs can be over 35,000, and each HCO may store or warehouse up to 8,000 of these items.3 Health care goods include items as diverse as biological agents, food, pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment, and large-scale technology/machinery. Adding to this complexity is the fact that item stockouts may result in a patient fatality or long-term disability.
Considering the burden placed on health care to operate at the lowest possible cost while still providing the best possible services, it is understandable that health care materials managers are looking for help to maximize service and improve efficiencies from their logistics partners. However, while the health care value chain continues to develop and change at a rapid pace, keeping up with medical technology, the intraorganizational health care delivery system has remained largely the same.4 This lack of change is problematic as research has shown that a significant portion of health care managers agree that the management of inbound transportation and delivery needs improvement. A study of challenges facing the health care supply chain found that 62% of HCO materials managers and 56% hospital executives agreed that there is a need for better management of shipping and receiving activities. Likewise, 61% and 58% of the same groups, respectively, agreed that the management of transportation, transfer activities, and delivery also needed improvement.5 Further, studies have also shown that 48% of HCO supply chain costs could be avoided through the implementation of improved logistics processes.6
Research has also found that part of the reason why HCOs are lacking in supply chain mastery and innovation is their dependence on small and partial truckload shipments.7 In more traditional supply chain and manufacturing operations, logistics departments are able to achieve efficiencies through full truck shipments or loop runs. Most HCOs, however, do not have large enough demand to capitalize on full truck load efficiencies. Additionally, HCOs tend to see logistics as transactional versus strategic and therefore do not traditionally invest strategically in technology, staffing, or innovation to optimize logistics. The lack of supply chain mastery causes heightened concern when considering that logistic costs in health care are cited as more than 30% of the total expense of an item versus only 5% in the retail industry.8
Supply chain optimization is also impeded by the fact that supply chain roles at HCOs often focus on contract negotiation and purchasing and pay little to no attention to logistics management.9 As a result of this lack of attention to the external supply chain, HCOs may miss cost reductions and efficiency improvements that may be available. Parcel carriers, for example, can aid in improving expedited deliveries, cold chain deliveries, product security, and inbound freight as well as optimizing the overall network.
On top of these challenges, the growth of e-commerce and omnichannel retail has led to many changes in the supply chain that impact all industries, including HCOs. The number of packages in the parcel carrier system has increased exponentially, placing a strain on the transportation mode that HCOs depend on the most.
BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE SITUATION
To better understand whether there is widespread concern amongst supply chain managers at HCOs about the increased number of consumer shipments due to e-commerce and their potential impact on deliveries to HCOs, we conducted in-depth interviews with managers from four HCOs (see Figure 1) and distributed surveys to 100 health care supply chain professionals throughout the United States.

[Figure 1] Characteristics of interviewed HCOsEnlarge this image
In both the survey and the interviews, we asked HCO supply chain managers about their current concerns, situation, relationships, and needs regarding logistic services. Our questions were designed to learn more about HCO perspectives on the state of shipping/receiving and the role of third parties. The survey results and the interviews helped give us a clearer picture of HCOs’ current challenges with inbound logistics, particularly with regards to types of delivery failures, frequency of delivery failures, shipping/receiving management, and carrier usage and expectations.
An important part of this investigation was to understand what carriers HCOs are using and their expectations of those carriers. With that goal, the survey asked the respondents to rank the following carriers based on how often they use each: Amazon Business, DHL, Federal Express (FedEx), United Parcel Service (UPS), United States Post Office (USPS), and other specialized carriers. A ranking of 1 indicated that the carrier was the HCO’s most often used provider and 6, its least often.
The bar chart in Figure 2 shows the weighted rankings and distribution for each carrier. Weighted rankings use the weighted average of each response in order to give us the ability to see which carrier ranks highest across all responses in terms of usage. For example, FedEx received the majority of rank 1 votes, however, it did not appear as often in the highest ranks of 1, 2, and 3 combined as UPS. Therefore, UPS is identified as the most often used carrier using weighted ranking. Another significant finding here is that Amazon Business is not, in general, seen as a key provider. Although Amazon Business was selected at each rank level, it was most often selected in ranks 4, 5, and 6, or the least often used.

The option of “other–specialized carriers” was also selected by the respondents in each rank. The survey allowed the respondents to specify what carriers are used in this category. Seventeen respondents did so, with the answers ranging from eBay and Staples to other major carriers such as SAIA, Teals, and Triose.
The survey also asked respondents to note how often they use health care specialty services such as FedEx Healthcare Solutions, UPS Healthcare and Lifesciences Supply Chain, and DHL Life Sciences and Healthcare. One hundred percent of the respondents said they did not use these specialty services. The reasons offered follow: 45% of the respondents stated that they were not aware of these specialized services, 25% said that these services are cost prohibitive, 23% said that the specialty services do not offer the services that they desire, and 7% offered no reason why the services were not used.
Finally, the survey asked the respondents to rank their desired carrier capabilities with 1 being the most important. Figure 3 shows the weighted values for each of the carrier capabilities. Overnight/expedited deliveries is ranked as the most important of the carrier services followed closely by tracking accuracy and reliability. Compliance and security are ranked similarly and fall in at spots 4 and 5.

DELIVERY FAILURES ARE INCREASING
The main focus of the survey was to assess HCOs’ experiences with delivery failures. The survey asked respondents to note how often they experience delivery failures and if they have seen any changes in the frequency in the last 21 to 24 months. The results are shown in Figure 4. More than half (51%) of respondents noted that they had experienced increases in delayed shipments in the last 12 months and, of those, 71% experienced delays on a daily or weekly basis. A majority (58%) of all respondents—whether they have seen an increase in delays or not—say they experience delayed shipments on a daily or weekly basis. Twenty-eight percent of respondents note that delayed shipments directly affect patient care at least once a week and that their cold-chain shipments experienced delays at the same rate as other items.

[Figure 4] Delivery failure frequency and changes in frequencEnlarge this image
The survey responses reiterated what we heard during the executive interviews. For example, we interviewed the director of supply chain and the materials management contract specialist of an HCO made up of three hospitals with over 600 beds and 60 physicans’ practices. Both executives stated that there has been an increase in delivery delays and that they believe that the increase of consumer packages being delivered by parcel carriers was affecting their organization’s ability to receive timely and accurate deliveries. One executive noted that they have had to help a driver dig through consumer boxes to try and find the hospital’s delivery on more than one occasion.
Two delivery failure examples are described here:
Example 1:An order for tissue allograft was placed on Friday. It was scheduled to be delivered on Monday for use in a surgery on Tuesday. The tissue left the vendor and arrived at the parcel carrier’s distribution hub. When the truck arrived on Monday at 10:30 a.m., the tissue was not on the truck. The biologics distributor tracked the tissue and determined it was still at the carrier’s distribution center. It was discovered that the tissue had been left on the dock over the weekend. Due to oversight, it was not placed on the truck to be delivered to the HCO. This neglect resulted in ruining the temperature-sensitive product; it could no longer be used in surgery, thus delaying the operation.}
Example 2:A surgeon called the distribution center on Friday requesting two products for a surgery on Monday. I could not overnight the products on Saturday for Sunday delivery because the distribution center is closed over the weekend. I had these two products ordered on Sunday to be overnighted and arrive at 9 a.m. on Monday. The truck driver arrived at 9 a.m. at the distribution center and delivered one of the products. The second product was overlooked and remained on the truck. The driver finished the route before realizing that the second product was still on the truck. The driver returned to the distribution center with the second product at 10:30 a.m. However, our truck had already left with product 1 to deliver it to the surgeon. To remedy the situation, I was required to personally deliver product 2 to ensure that the surgery was able to take place as planned.}
TYPES OF DELIVERY FAILURES
Drilling further down, the survey asked respondents what specific types of delivery problems they were facing and how frequently they experienced each of these delivery failures. They were also asked about the impact of these failures from a financial and patient care perspective on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 indicated insignificant and 5 indicated severe impact). From these responses, we developed a weighted ranking indicating which types of delay were the most problematic. Figure 5 shows the weighted rankings for the most common types of delivery failures.

[Figure 5] Delivery failure weighted rankingsEnlarge this image
According to the weighted results, the biggest delivery problem that HCOs are facing is delayed receipt. However, delayed or missing data about the delivery, damaged packaging, and damaged items also placed high, receiving almost identical rankings. Incorrect labeling, receiving the wrong item, and having items delivered to the wrong locations were also frequently cited problems.
As Figure 6 shows, each type of failure was ranked as the biggest delivery problem for at least 6% of respondents. This finding shows that each of the delivery failures listed are being experienced on a broad scale through the health care industry.

[Figure 6] What is your top delivery problem?Enlarge this image
For example, one HCO, consisting of a hospital with 385 beds, 35 physicians’ offices, and an outpatient surgery did not have the same problems with delayed receipt as its counterparts. While it had received late and missing deliveries from time to time, its most significant issues pertained to labeling, according to the director of supply chain management. Shipments were being received at the HCO’s warehouse without specific labels indicating the final destination within the organization. This lack of labeling delays the final delivery of the product to the end user. “Carriers deny that labeling is their responsibility, however, they should screen packages to confirm that they have the appropriate identifying information,” the director said. “This is a lack of communication between the HCO and the carrier.”
THE EFFECT OF E-COMMERCE
The survey also asked the respondents to discuss any trends that they were seeing in shipping/delivery problems. This was an open-ended question that allowed the respondents to reply with their own words. The responses were examined for repeated concepts and ideas. Problems cited in the open-ended answers included: backorders (8% of all answers); shipping is generally slowing down (11%); drivers are overloaded, overworked, or lazy (15%); and the system is overwhelmed (10%). Some shared that they are experiencing the effects of driver fatigue such as throwing packages and rushing.
Notably, no one mentioned e-commerce as a potential contributor to these problems. However, when asked whether or not consumer e-commerce shipping was negatively affecting their deliveries, 41% said yes. Some respondents again commented that the system was “overwhelmed,” while others discussed the lack of capacity at the carriers. Some noted that the problem is worse during the holidays.
In particular, some HCOs are seeing the increase in consumer package deliveries as affecting their ability to receive orders efficiently and effectively. We interviewed the director of materials management at one HCO who said the “glut” of packages from consumer-based e-commerce has affected the strict time requirements for parcel carriers. This rush has caused drivers to not give their employees the time necessary to fully audit deliveries before giving their signature of receipt.
This HCO has 1,500 beds in nine hospitals with over 300 additional offices and facilities. Due to the size of this HCO, it receives large volumes of products and packages each day. The interviewee noted that the HCO does not experience significant delays in shipments because of its size and the volume of packages to be delivered. However, the numerous packages and shipments received throughout the day do cause a delay in receiving. Because of time pressures from the carriers, the employees only check to ensure that they received the proper number of packages; they are not checking if everything on the packing slip has been received and is undamaged. When there are errors, the carrier relies on the receiving signature to determine if all items were delivered correctly. However, many times these signatures were made without a full audit of the shipment. The HCO incurs additional costs when resolving these types of issues. An example of this type of situation is described by the director as follows:
Two expensive pieces of equipment should have been among the typical 150 package shipment. When it was discovered that the pieces were not delivered, a long process of searching for the product ensued. The HCO ultimately had to replace the items at its own expense.
It is important to note that not all HCOs are experiencing delivery problems. For example, the materials management manager at a small critical access hospital with only 25 beds said that they do not have notable issues with shipment receipts from carriers. This HCO, however, belongs to a group purchasing organization (GPO) and its membership includes a national contract with a major carrier. When they experience issues with their carrier, the HCO refers those shipping issues to the GPO for resolution. The manager shared that, “…being a member of the managing organization negates many of the problems that other HCOs face.” The manager attributed the size of the organization as the reason why the organization was able to manage their shipments well.
HOW TO IMPROVE?The survey responses and executive interviews both support the need for improvements in health care logistic services. Most notably the following suggestions or improvements were raised on multiple occasions and are supported by the data:
Increase parcel carrier training regarding issues unique to HCOs.Create and implement universal specialized labeling for all HCO packages for ease of recognition.Increase communication, either direct or indirect, between HCOs and their parcel carriers.Improve the methods used to differentiate between consumer packages and business-to-business packages.
The respondents took time to include comments at the end of the survey. Most notably they emphasized the importance of delivery outcomes such as on-time deliveries, on-time data receipt, undamaged packages, no missing packages, correct delivery location, and correct labeling. The survey respondents repeatedly commented that delivery outcomes can affect the finances of their HCOs but more often stated that delivery outcomes affect the efficiencies of their organizations and, ultimately, became a part of patient care itself.

This study suggests that delivery problems are not unique to individual HCOs. Rather, these problems are universal and are being experienced on a widespread basis. Logistics and delivery is an area where HCOs could work together directly or through professional organizations in an effort to improve their communication and collaboration with key parcel carriers.
Discussing these problems with the parcel carriers in an open forum, perhaps on a national level, would lead to more transparency between HCOs and these service providers. These types of discussions would allow HCO supply chain managers to voice their concerns as they did in this survey. This could be an opportunity for managers to ask for driver training, to find economical ways to prioritize HCO shipments, and to ask for new ways to label HCO shipments. It could also be an opportunity for carriers to better understand the frustrations, concerns, and needs of their HCO partners in the last-mile health care supply chain

It looks like a race is shaping up to determine the future management of General Motors’ credit card business. This week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman Sachs is aggressively pushing to acquire the GM card, arguing that it’s the best company to usher GM into an era of commerce where cars will be the next great connected portal.
However, the Journal cited unnamed sources as saying that the London-based Barclays is also bidding for GM’s card business, while current issuer Capital One is unlikely to let the account go without a fight.
The GM card has about $3 billion in outstanding balances, making it an attractive target. But the Journal said that Goldman and Barclays aren’t as interested in what the card is today so much as what it has the potential to become in a future world of connected cars.
As GM cars are fitted with various smart features into their dashboards, consumers could use the card to connect with businesses directly from their vehicles. Drivers could easily pay for gas or groceries, book hotel rooms or order takeout food with a simple voice command or tap of a dashboard button.
For Goldman, a deal for GM’s credit card business would come as the investment bank is already pursuing a high-stakes plan to transform itself into a wider-ranging, consumer-focused financial services company, according to the Journal.
Goldman has already been pushing into consumer credit, most notably with its 2019 team-up with Apple on the Apple Card. The firm has also spent years expanding Marcus, its online banking service that began offering savings accounts and personal loans in 2016.
And while Goldman and Barclays are making news for their potential pursuit of GM’s card and car-connected commerce, they’re just the latest entrants in the race.
Ned Curic, vice president of Alexa Auto, told CNBC late last year that demand from the auto sector for voice-activated technology was “through the roof.”
“Two-and-a-half years ago, we had nothing,” he said last December. “We’re much further than I thought we would be. I’m quite pleased with the speed we were able to build and deploy.” 
Amazon is looking to jump on drivers’ increased desire for connectivity in cars, aiming to develop a smooth exchange between Alexa at home and in automobiles. At the same time, automakers are working to improve the quality of voice recognition in cars. 
Ten automakers had already signed on with Amazon as of early this year, with more expected to do so by the end of 2020. Arianne Walker, Amazon’s chief evangelist for Alexa Auto, told CNBC that Amazon was “essentially talking” with all major automakers about partnering in some form.
“It’s really more a matter of getting things lined up for the cars that are going to be released as opposed to any hesitation,” she told the network. 
Meanwhile, this week also saw Google’s GPS navigation app, Waze, roll out contactless payments for its 130 million U.S. active monthly users. With the new launch, drivers who pull into participating stations will get a notification on Waze prompting their Android or iOS device to securely pay through each company’s app.
“Waze is committed to continuing to help businesses leverage innovative technology to adapt, evolve and engage with customers,” Andrew Kandel, Waze U.S. country manager, said in a statement.
And it’s not just Big Tech firms hoping to jump into the automotive commerce experience. Dan Gittleman, CEO at automotive software supplier Xevo, told Karen Webster in a late 2019 interview that the auto industry’s original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) also want in on the potential commerce action. While Amazon, Google, Apple and others may want to control connected commerce transactions themselves, as the technology is embedded into the car’s infotainment system, that might not be the deal they’re offered.
“It doesn’t have to work that way,” Gittleman said. It will be up to the OEMs to negotiate the best deals they can with Amazon, Google and others in terms of the technology that will play a big role in connected vehicles.
Companies are racing to get into the connected car economy because of its lucrative potential. PYMNTS’ Digital Drive Report found that connected car commerce represents a $230 billion opportunity.
What are U.S. consumers doing with existing connected car technology, like smartphones plugged into the dashboard?
According to our data, 47 percent look for gas stations, followed by 35 percent who are ordering food for pick up at the drive-through and 33 percent who buy coffee for drive-through pick up. Smaller percentages use technology to order groceries or other items for pick up in the store.
Of course, consumers are spending less time in their cars than they did when we conducted our survey, as more of them are working from home. But Americans were already demonstrating in the pre-pandemic era that they were getting comfortable using their cars as commerce command centers.
It seems likely that those same customers – whose lives have generally become highly digitized because of COVID-19 – will be even more ready to turn their cars into digital shopping centers when they’re back on the road.
That means the race to “own” connected car commerce will likely carry on beyond Goldman, Barclays and Capital One’s battle for the rights to issue GM cards. After all, the reward at the end of the connected car tunnel looks like it will be too big to ignore.

The Western Australian Government has released the state’s first ever Electric Vehicle Strategy, which aims to increase the uptake of low and zero emission vehicles. The strategy is accompanied by a $21 million Electric Vehicle Fund – the largest single investment in EV charging infrastructure in Australia by a state or territory government. Infrastructure spoke with WA Minister for Climate Action, Amber-Jade Sanderson, on the Strategy and EV adoption in the state. 

By Patricia Mae 
Can you tell us a bit more about what the electric vehicle strategy involves?
The McGowan Government’s State Electric Vehicle Strategy outlines a suite of actions, supported by a $21 million investment, to assist the uptake of electric vehicles. It includes measures to install charging infrastructure; develop and update standards, guidelines, and planning approvals; and highlight the development of industry opportunities.
The aim of our State Electric Vehicle Strategy is to provide a pathway to decarbonising road transport in Western Australia.
What are the benefits of more EV adoption in the state?
Increasing the numbers of electric vehicles in Western Australia will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality in our cities and major regional centres. Electric vehicles will also reduce our reliance on imported oil, replacing it with domestically-produced electricity.
Electric vehicles present an opportunity to assist in decarbonising the electricity grid. In the future they will be able to provide vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid services that can soak up cheap excess solar energy during the middle of the day and potentially reduce the need for network investment.
What are some of the challenges to EV adoption in western Australia?
A key challenge in Western Australia is the vast size of our state and the need for further charging infrastructure. Measures that can be supported at the Commonwealth level, such as introducing vehicle carbon dioxide emission standards, will assist to improve electric vehicle model availability in Australia and Western Australia.
What infrastructure will be needed for the strategy?
As part of the strategy, the McGowan Government will create Australia’s longest electric vehicle fast charging network. This will allow travel north from Perth to Kununurra, south to Esperance and east to Kalgoorlie. The charging stations will be spaced approximately every 200km or less to ensure that public fast charging stations (50kW or more) are available along the designated routes.
What are the priority areas of action outlined in the strategy?
Key actions include:
Up to $20 million for the installation of a public electric vehicle fast charging networkA minimum 25 per cent electric vehicle acquisition target for the State Fleet by 2025-26, which will result in the acquisition of at least 255 electric vehicles over five years$800,000 for the installation of charging stations in government buildings to support the State Fleet electric vehicle targetDeveloping and updating standards, guidelines andplanning approval requirements to facilitate safe and efficient electric vehicle use and chargingUndertaking a trial of battery electric buses on the Joondalup Central Area Transit ServiceProviding reliable and accessible public information on electric vehicles – their features, performance, operation and benefitsDelivery of industry development actions under the Future Battery Industry Strategy Western Australia and Western Australian Renewable Hydrogen Strategy
What kind of job-creating opportunities could the strategy, and by extension more EV adoption, create for western australia?
The installation of the electric vehicle fast charging network will create jobs in Western Australia, particularly in regional areas. Global and domestic uptake of electric vehicles presents significant opportunities for industry and job creation in this state.
We have some of the world’s largest reserves of the minerals used to create batteries and we have the skills, infrastructure and standards to become a major player in the global battery value chain.
To complement opportunities in the battery industry, the McGowan Government is supporting industry efforts to grow the renewable hydrogen industry, with future potential for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles particularly in the long haul, heavy vehicle sector.
How does Western Australia compare to other states and territories in terms of EV adoption and what advice would you give them?
The McGowan Government’s commitment to building Australia’s longest fast charging network is one way we are leading the nation in creating the kind of infrastructure needed for Australian conditions, particularly here in WA.
This is a critical step and provides key connection points within every 200km, from Kununurra in the north to Esperance in the south and Kalgoorlie in the east. It will go some way to addressing anxiety about the current distance range of electric vehicles.
However, Australia’s access to the global electric vehicle market is constrained by a range of factors, including less stringent fuel emissions standards and lack of fuel efficiency or carbon emission standards.
The McGowan Government intends to work constructively with the Commonwealth, other state and territory governments, and industry to advocate for policy reforms aimed at ensuring Australian consumers can access a greater variety of electric vehicle models at lower prices.
Which other stakeholders will be involved in the implementation?
The Western Australian Electric Vehicles Working Group, chaired by the Western Australian Department of Water and Environmental Regulation, will assist in coordinating the implementation of the Strategy.
The WA Electric Vehicles Working Group includes membership of several State Government agencies; the energy utilities – Synergy, Horizon Power and Western Power; as well as the Western Australian Local Government Association and the Royal Automobile Club Western Australia.
In addition, the WA Electric Vehicles Working Group will continue to work closely with other stakeholders, including the Australian Electric Vehicles Association, industry, academia, training providers, non-government associations and organisations.
What are the next steps?
The charging infrastructure network will be installed and operational within three years. The McGowan Government aims to reach a minimum 25 per cent electric vehicle acquisition target, within eligible fleet segments, for the State Fleet within five years.
We will continue to monitor trends in electric vehicle technology and markets, and will review the strategy in the next three years. This will ensure Western Australia keeps pace with and continues to benefit from the opportunities presented by electric vehicles.

Photonic integration has become a key technology for bringing costs down and achieving the performance needed for autonomous vehicles. 
By  Jeff Hecht 
When it comes to autonomous vehicles, the industry is shifting gears. Late in 2020, Honda said that this March it would introduce so-called “Traffic Jam Assist” in its Japanese Legend model; it’s autonomy in the slow lane, a feature that takes over control of a personal car when highway traffic slows to a crawl. Then, says the manual, it uses radar and cameras to automatically follow the car ahead at a safe distance, as long as the road is nearly straight and with detectable lane markers.1 This frees the human driver from having to worry about traffic until it picks up to highway speed, at which point the has to take the wheel again. Robo-taxis lacking any controls for human drivers have slipped further into the future.
A bigger shift in the works is putting autonomous systems in control of long-haul trucks. Big rigs spend long hours on the road, and typically some 95% of their mileage is on well-maintained, limited-access highways—a well-controlled environment that is friendly for autonomous vehicles. In the near-term, developers envision keeping a human in the truck to take the wheel when needed to go off-highway to depots or to steer through difficult situations like temporary detours directed by road crews. Full Level 4 autonomy would come in a few more years as the technology is refined and verified. Big rigs are big investments, and the savings of having robots able to drive straight through without rest stops or sleep could pay for the new technology.
A bumpy road toward autonomy
These shifts in direction partly reflect economic and technological limits, but the most important limit may be the capabilities of human drivers. Developers originally envisioned that automotive autonomy would shift control from human drivers to robots by progressing through the levels shown in the sidebar (see “Levels of autonomy”). The original target was Level 3 autonomy, with the robot driving the car and the human driver with eyes on the road and hands on the wheel, ready to take over if needed with little or no warning.
However, in reality, people are easily distracted even when they are driving a car. If they are just watching the car drive, their eyes are likely to wander to their phone or some other screen than to stay on the road. Tesla drivers not looking ahead have been killed when their cars failed to recognize white trucks crossing the road ahead of them against a blue sky. An Uber vehicle killed a pedestrian walking a bicycle across a road at night because it could not recognize the pedestrian; when it turned control over to the safety driver, she just had time to look up from her phone when the car smashed into the pedestrian.
These fatal accidents have led many developers to think that Level 3 is a bad idea; many companies are expected to jump straight from Level 2 to Level 4, which requires the car to be able to handle most conditions without human assistance.2 The public has also grown wary, especially after embarrassing nonfatal accidents such as a self-driving car crashing into a bright-red fire truck stopped in the road with lights flashing. The pandemic slammed the brakes on development in early 2020, but companies had already been slowing development to refine technology and reduce costs.
Personal cars vs. robo-taxis
Tesla Motors (Palo Alto, CA) delivered almost half a million personal cars in 2020, a 35% increase over 2019.3 All Teslas since March 2019 come with the Autopilot feature, and enhanced software called “Full Self-Driving Capability” is available as an option offering extra features. Among the extras is the ability for the car to drive from highway on-ramp to off-ramp, navigating interchanges, changing lanes, and taking the correct exit. However, the company emphasizes that the self-driving features “require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.”4 In other words, it still expects the driver to have eyes on the road and hands on the wheel.
Like Honda’s traffic-jam pilot, Tesla’s control system uses radars and cameras to sense the environment, but not lidar. Two years ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk proclaimed “anyone relying on lidar is doomed,” and that radar and cameras are good enough for navigation.5 It might be fairer to say that lidars are too expensive for Tesla to make a profit selling personal cars with self-driving features.
Honda’s Traffic Jam Assist appears to be using similar technology, but only for following the car ahead through traffic moving so slowly that serious injuries are unlikely. The manual is cautious, warning that the feature will not work properly when following a motorcycle, entering a toll booth, or if the car being followed shifts to another lane. Some other companies have developed similar systems for personal cars.
Robo-taxis being developed by Google’s Waymo division, GM’s Cruise, and other companies are a different market: companies offering personal transport as a service. These vehicles would be on the road much of the time, not sitting in garages like personal cars, helping to offset costs of lidar needed for autonomy. Level 4 autonomy would be desirable. However, those plans have slowed, and Uber Technologies (San Francisco, CA), an early pioneer, sold its autonomous car group to Aurora (Bozeman, MT) in December.6
Nobody is delivering cars with true Level 4 autonomy now, says Jason Eichenholz, co-founder and chief technology officer at Luminar Technologies (Orlando, FL). However, in 2022 Volvo will begin distributing cars with an optional system called Volvo Highway Pilot that combines Luminar’s Iris 1550 nm lidar with other sensors and autonomy software from Zenseact (Göteborg, Sweden). The lidar will be the first in a consumer vehicle.
On controlled-access highways, Eichenholz says the Volvo offering will be “a true driver out of the loop” system with Level 4 autonomy. Highway traffic can be fast, but the environment is much more predictable than city or suburban streets, with no cross traffic, pedestrians, traffic signals, or bicycles. Level 4 autonomy with high-performance lidars provides long sensing ranges and high point density to identify objects in the highway environment and safely steer around them. The car would turn driving over to the human in other environments, so a typical driver would guide the car from home to highway, the car would drive from there to the off ramp, and the human would resume control when leaving the highway to drive to their destination.
“Over time, you will see the operational domain of that Level 4 experience expand” to cover more of the driving experience as technology improves, says Eichenholz. But don’t expect a rapid transition. “Getting to Level 5 with the driver fully out of the loop in all operational domains is really hard,” he says. “It’s easy to get to 99% coverage [of roadways], but regulators want five nines.” There’s a good reason for that. Rural America is full of unmarked and unpaved roads, and foul weather can cut visibility to a car length and transform highways into slippery messes.
A boom in robo-trucks
As in personal cars, Tesla aims to be the first to market with large trucks with autonomous features. In January, the company announced it will begin manufacturing Tesla Semi trucks this year, and they will include autonomous driving features similar to those in Tesla autos.7 However, the main focus of the Semi appears to be its all-electric “zero emission” power system, which led Walmart to order 130 of the trucks in September 2020.8
Other companies see long-haul trucking as potentially the biggest near-term market for autonomous vehicles. It’s an $800 billion per-year business in the U.S., and it runs up most of its mileage on Interstate highways. The trucking industry says it needs 60,000 more truckers now, and the shortage is expected to grow as veteran drivers retire, making autonomy attractive. Luminar has teamed with Daimler Trucks and Torc Robotics to develop Level 4 autonomous truck systems. The size of big rigs is an advantage because it gives them room to space sensors more widely and to carry other automation systems.
Much technology used in autonomous cars can be transferred to trucks. However, “the dynamics and functional behaviors of trucks are very different” from those of passenger cars, says Chuck Price, chief product officer at TuSimple (San Diego, CA).9 Trucks are big, and fully loaded they have a huge momentum at highway speeds, so they need long-range sensing and object recognition to stop them safely. TuSimple equips its trucks with 10 high-definition cameras that can identify vehicles up to 1000 m away (day or night, rain or shine), giving them plenty of room to steer around other vehicles or stop when needed (see Fig. 1). Five microwave radars can detect and identify objects up to 300 m away, important if fog or rain impairs vision. A pair of lidars with 200 m range give detailed views of objects inside that range.
So far, TuSimple trucks have been driving test runs with human safety drivers onboard between Arizona and Texas. Sometime this year, they plan to have a truck drive the route in autonomous mode without active human supervision, although a safety driver and a test engineer will be in the vehicle monitoring its performance. TuSimple’s goal is demonstrating Level 4 driving between terminals located a short distance from highway exits. The company has teamed with Navistar, the maker of International trucks, to begin producing Level 4 autonomous trucks by 2024 for highway use. Several other companies have similar plans including Embark, Google’s Waymo subsidiary,10 Plus Technology, and Aurora, a Silicon-Valley area company which bought Uber’s autonomous vehicle group in December 2020 and plans to introduce autonomy in trucks before cars.
Meeting manufacturing needs
A key challenge for the photonics industry is building manufacturing technology on the size and scale needed for automotive use, says Eichenholz. Industry requirements are tough. They insist on volume production at an affordable cost to withstand temperatures from -40° to 80°C. Automotive customers need time to test the safety and quality of new products, and they then need a couple of years to get a new product on the production line.
Building a supply chain and automating production takes human and financial resources. Luminar started by building products internally, then developed partnerships with contract manufacturers and others. They began by building from the chip level up, doing die placement, wire bonding, and other steps. As their products evolved, they put more and more functions into application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to drive down costs and improve performance. For example, they put signal processing into ASICs to avoid the capacitance of wire bonds to detectors and the inductance of laser circuits.
The company’s lidar expertise helped them balance tradeoffs in their pulsed 1550 nm time-of-flight (ToF) lidar. Eichenholz says they chose mechanical scanning because it “is really reliable, with none of the resonance or temperature problems you have with MEMS.” Mechanical polygon mirrors scan fast in the horizontal plane; galvanometers scan slowly in the vertical direction. The technology was used 40 years ago in bar-code scanners, and now it can be very cost-effective in volume. Scanning both the output beam and the receiver makes the field of view very narrow, blocking interference from the sun and other sources.
Photonic integration promises to improve lidar cost and performance. Luminar is working to reduce costs of driver-assistance lidars to $500, and of the more precise lidars needed for autonomous cars to $1000.11 Those are huge drops from earlier levels in the tens of thousands of dollars, and they helped attract deals with Volvo and Daimler Trucks. In November, Mobileye, an Israeli subsidiary of Intel, chose Luminar’s lidars for its first-generation Level 4 autonomous driving system for robo-taxis.12 Luminar has plenty of competition in ToF lidar, including Velodyne Lidar (San Jose, CA), which began offering lidars in 2010, and several other companies.
Competing lidar technologies
An alternative lidar technology also is emerging. In January 2021, Mobileye announced plans to build future versions of its automated driving system by 2025 to a new chip-scale frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) lidar being developed at Intel.13
FMCW lidar chirps the frequency of the outgoing beam and mixes return signals coherently with part of the outgoing signal. Comparing the frequencies determines target distance and can directly measure velocity; ToF systems cannot measure velocity directly. Advocates cite other advantages of coherent lidars, including relative immunity to interference from sunlight and other lidars, higher sensitivity, and lower peak power.14
J. K. Doylend and S. Gupta of Intel’s Silicon Photonic Product division reported at SPIE Photonics West 2020 that the FMCW lidar’s ability to directly detect both range and velocity was very attractive for autonomous cars. Achieving that performance required dense integration of optics including lasers, amplifiers, phase and amplitude control, low-noise photodetectors, mode converters, and waveguides, but integration can produce compact lidars in high volume.15
Current lidar systems combine information from cameras, ToF lidars, and radars to steer vehicles. Mobileye’s new system will combine FMCW lidar data with radar to create one viewing channel, and use camera data to produce a second independent channel. They believe that combination will improve safety and performance when commercial versions arrive in 2025. “This is really game-changing,” Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua said in January at the virtual Consumer Electronics Show (CES).16
Aurora is already testing FMCW lidars from Insight Lidar (Lafayette, CO) on its developmental autonomous trucks (see Fig. 2). FMCW lidar offers long detection range and higher sensitivity, important for long-range detection needed at highway speeds, says Greg Smolka, Insight Laser’s vice president of business development. They target having early versions in use by 2023, significant volume by 2025, and production use in autonomous cars in 2026.FIGURE 2.

Smolka says direct detection of velocity on every return makes FMCW lidar useful in discriminating between objects as well as measuring their velocity. “The images of a motorcycle passing a truck can blur together in a camera because they are at the same range, but if you have velocity in the data, the two are easily discriminated,” he says. Having velocity with every pixel can enhance resolution for the difficult “edge cases” where it’s otherwise hard to meet performance levels needed for Level 4 and 5 autonomy.
Another FMCW maker, Aeva (Mountain View, CA), says its lidar has a 300 m range, high pixel density at all ranges, and a 120° × 30° field of view available now. In January, Aeva announced a partnership with TuSimple to deploy its “4D” lidar on their Level 4 autonomous trucks.
Another potential competitor is flash lidar, originally developed to avoid moving parts in docking or landing spacecraft. Laser pulses are spread across a range of angles, and receiver optics focus returns onto a two-dimensional detector array. Processing the returned signals yields a three-dimensional point cloud, with distance gathered from the return time. It has the advantage of simplicity, but the dispersion of pulse energy across a wide range limits received power, which usually has constrained range to under 100 m.17
Outlook
Autonomous vehicles have made amazing progress in the past several years, but challenges remain.
Lidar must solve some technical issues to meet the needs of autonomy. Near the top of the list is the inherent tradeoff between lidar range and the density of the point cloud it can measure at a distance. Lidars are very good at mapping objects a few tens of meters away, but the points spread further apart with distance. At 100 m, points spaced at 0.025° intervals are 8.7 cm apart. That’s not going to put enough points on a pedestrian to tell if they are about to cross the street or are looking in the opposite direction. Even the speed of light is an issue because lidar pulses must be spaced far apart for light to make a round trip: 1.3 μs for an object at 200 m, limiting repetition rate to 770,000 Hz.
Other technologies used in autonomy and the road environment pose other challenges. So does the unusual and unexpected. Can we count on an autonomous car to slam on the brakes for a person carrying a bag, but not a bag blowing in the wind?
Photonic integration and good engineering will help overcome these challenges. (It may even help with artificial intelligence; watch for an upcoming article.) We also may have to accept limitations. I’ve lived in New England long enough to have learned that the best way to get through foul weather is to wait for it to blow away.

According to the United Nations Population Fund, more than half of the world’s population now lives in urban areas, and it is predicted that approximately 66 percent of the world’s population will live in an urban environment by 2050.
Massive efforts are underway today, designed to address the consequences of this surge, which, left unmanaged, would result in climate, energy, environment, and living conditions in the cities of the future.
Citizen engagement is mission-critical to achieving true Smart Cities, which can improve the lives of those who live, work and play in modern cities, but with this comes the important resolution of data security and privacy.
Today, the physical and digital infrastructures of cities are embedded with billions of devices at the edge, part of a “layered” approach to Smart City solutions.  We have already witnessed attacks, including unauthorized access to sensitive data and denial of service (DoS), which can quickly nullify the benefits of connected systems designed to support those who live in urban areas.
Even as early as 2015, nearly a quarter of a million citizens living in Ukraine suffered a long period of electricity disconnection because the power grid system was attacked by hackers.
Fast-forward to 2021, and now that many Smart City systems have been implemented, security and privacy issues have become a major challenge that requires effective countermeasures. The challenges are great when we add cameras, people counters, and other applications as traditional cybersecurity protection strategies cannot be applied directly to these given the heterogeneity and ever-evolving characteristics of smart cities.
For people to trust sophisticated Smart City solutions, we must address security and privacy threats when designing and implementing new mechanisms or systems.
We caught up this week with Avner Ziv, CEO of Cloud of Things, at the Frontier Conference, where Ziv spoke on a panel discussing the value, integrity, management, and security of big data lakes where sensor-generated information is stored and analyzed.
“Citizen concerns are very real,” Ziv said, “since, given the rapid development of information technologies including AI, machine learning, and data mining, adversaries are developing the ability to bypass the current detection mechanisms. Security and privacy are the only way to get to trust in Smart City applications, and so we are spending a great deal of time understanding and addressing the gaps.”
Ziv explained that there is no uniform IoT architecture; however, the Industrial IoT community and global ecosystem are heading in that direction. “The sensing layer is used for data collection from things, and that layer must be fully secured, from hardware and firmware to edge compute software. The network layer is the core layer in physical/digital architectures, and it must also be fully secured, whether the data is traversing the public Internet or private networks that connect smart things, network devices, and servers and ship data to the cloud through gateways.”
Ziv explained Smart City IoT as more of an Industrial IoT category, including additional layers for support, which works very closely with the application layer, and provides support for the requirements of diversified applications via intelligent computing techniques (edge, fog, and cloud).
“It is in the highest layer, the application layer, where we find the most challenges in terms of trust, as this layer provides intelligent and practical services or applications to users based on their personalized requirements,” Ziv said. “For example, a citizen within a Smart City may wish to understand and manage their energy consumption with smart meters, but they may be worried about the kind of behavioral data collected about their energy consumption at any hour of the day. We are observing a movement toward citizen engagement that enables individuals and families to contribute to carbon reduction, alongside the utilities, but are also seeing concerns about what that practically means.”
Ziv, whose company based in Israel is supporting certain government and service provider initiatives, also pointed out that smart government needs to manage data – interconnecting it across systems, institutions, digital and physical infrastructure management.
“We are seeing more and more demand for data ownership solutions – including the secure routing of data to more than one application or cloud,” Ziv said. “Citizens may trust more if they are aware that their data is not being used by special interests and that their data is being secured by government agencies on highly protected edge, network, and cloud application layers. Cloud of Things offers its customers the option to securely send data from their devices in the field directly to their private cloud tenant, while still enjoying our advanced device management features.”
Standardization and interoperability are also important areas to tackle, Ziv said. “Intelligent public transportation networks can enhance the safety, speed and reliability of light rail and traffic and parking management can benefit those who choose to use their private vehicles when they are in the city, but without a common understanding of how the collection, analysis, and activation of near-real-time systems works, natural concerns rise – for example, the government ‘tracking’ the moves of individuals and organizations.”
Ziv applauded the efforts of organizations like The Linux Foundation and their LF Edge projects which aim to build standards that will drive trust in the future. “We are already a highly connected society, and now a hyper-connected society,” Ziv said. “Only by collaboration, by bringing together public and private organizations, and by engaging individuals and businesses in the discussion can we sustainably develop solutions that provide personalized services but not at the risk of invasion of privacy and threats to freedom and democracy.”
Ziv presented at The Frontier Conference this week as part of a panel, “Data is the True Currency of Connected Industrial Solutions,” sponsored by Rocket Wagon Venture Studio and moderated by Don DeLoach. Chris Swan of Dispersive is also on the panel.

According to a recently released study, autonomous vehicles (AVs) hold significant potential to open up wider economic opportunities currently beyond the reach of many low-income households due to inadequate transportation. 
 By Ken Briodagh 
The report, “Fostering Economic Opportunity through Autonomous Vehicle Technology,” by SAFE, reportedly concludes that on-demand, point-to-point AV transit can cut financial stress by providing reliable, affordable and efficient transportation that is a crucial factor in determining the upward social mobility of low-income households.
Although the post-pandemic priority for transit agencies is to get current transportation systems back up to speed, AV trials are still necessary to incorporate low-cost, autonomous transit into the future transportation mix as soon as possible—at per-mile costs far lower than today’s transportation options.
 As a result, low-income communities would be able to access opportunities that are out of reach due to enduring gaps in current systems, particularly outside of traditional business hours.
“The biggest factor in upward economic mobility is actual mobility, and for many Americans, today’s transportation system simply isn’t an affordable or efficient option,” said Robbie Diamond, President and CEO, SAFE. “It is important that the immediate focus be on getting America up and running again, but today’s AV pilots will become tomorrow’s automated, integrated transportation system that serves everyone equally and effectively, regardless of location or time of day.”
SAFE’s report notes:
The most conservative cost-per-mile estimate for an autonomous, shared and electric car in 2030 is 50 cents. In contrast, the cost per mile for buses today is $1.31.More than 75 million households—almost two-thirds of U.S. households—live in neighborhoods with housing and transportation costs above 45 percent of typical household income, a level that forces many families to make difficult choices and which is also hard to sustain over time.For every 1 percent reduction in the cost of transportation with a fixed housing cost, approximately 750,000 households enter affordability.AV transportation could reduce household costs by as much as $5,600 per household, or $3,800 per American. SAFE found that reducing average transportation costs by $5,000 per year in urbanized neighborhoods brings more than 25 million households within the 45 percent threshold.Employment growth areas in our modern economy—such as job opportunities in e-commerce—remain accessible only by car. For instance, SAFE found that Amazon’s 60 largest U.S. fulfillment centers and facilities are inaccessible to those who work there, unless commuting by personal vehicle, which makes it hard for people to benefit from these new economic opportunities.Transportation is a typical household’s second-largest expense, behind housing, and low- and middle-income populations find the lower housing costs when they move to suburbs and exurbs are often offset by the higher amount they spend on transportation. As their housing costs decrease, their transportation costs can increase by as much as five times, as measured by a share of income.The necessity of owning a car to access jobs forces millions of low-income Americans to make difficult choices to keep a personal vehicle. Seven million Americans are at least three months behind on car payments, and many that do make car payments often do so instead of paying rent or mortgages.

Integrated telematics systems enable fleet managers and field service providers to have faster response times when crashes occur, and greater visibility into driver behavior and vehicle maintenance data.
Safety is paramount for the modern fleet.
On average, 20% of commercial fleets will be involved in an accident this year due to the high number of miles they drive, according to OSHA data.
A typical motorist in the U.S. travels 12,000 to 15,000 miles annually, and each year has a 1-in-15 chance of being involved in a vehicle collision. However, most fleet drivers travel substantially more miles, resulting in even greater exposure to crash risks.
To proactively manage these risks, a growing number of commercial fleet operators and transportation logistics managers have embraced driver safety systems or dash cameras that provide a range of valuable insights into their fleet – from actionable video intelligence to vehicle risk management services that deliver detailed information about crash events in near real time.
Integrated telematics systems enable fleet managers and field service providers to have faster response times when crashes occur, and greater visibility into driver behavior and vehicle maintenance data. These data-driven, actionable insights offer a comprehensive view of vehicles and drivers throughout their routes, helping fleet operators protect drivers, fleets and their bottom line.
Video telematics mean safer fleetsOne of the best ways to ensure road and driver safety is to utilize video telematics.
A standard stream-and-store dashcam can show, after the fact, what happened during an incident, assuming a manager has time to search through the DVR footage and match it with telematics data to find the few seconds that matter.
A smart video telematics solution that combines computer vision technology, artificial intelligence and vehicle motion data provides so much more contextual insights that can directly improve safety and coaching efficiency.
While telematics can report the “what” of an incident, smarter, more integrated video technology can tell a fleet manager the “why” by providing a complete picture of what happened before, during and after an incident.
For example, when the telematics edge device identifies an inertial trigger such as harsh braking or harsh cornering, the device tells the camera to save a video clip of the event. That clip is sent to the cloud, where it can be viewed immediately or downloaded to view later. When alerted by these driving exceptions, fleet managers can focus on the incident in context without weeding through endless hours of footage.
The more inertial and vision triggers available with a video telematics solution, the better for driver coaching and overall fleet safety. Triggers can be customized to flag any speed limit and stop sign violations, tailgating, lane drift, harsh braking, acceleration and cornering, allowing organizations the freedom to choose which triggers matter most.
Managers can use these incidents to provide an immersive coaching experience to improve driver behavior and fleet-wide safety. Suddenly, driver coaching goes from cookie cutter to driver-specific, and driving behavior improves.
Conversely, safe habits can also be detected, reinforced and rewarded. Managers can implement video telematics solutions to encourage good behavior by creating driver scorecards and positive recognition programs inside fleets. With this kind of positive reinforcement, drivers actively engage in improving their statistics.
Video telematics tell the true storyThe vast majority of car-truck accidents are often the fault of the driver of the passenger car, yet many assume the commercial truck driver is in the wrong unless evidence shows otherwise.
In the absence of sophisticated video safety systems, fleet managers can spend a considerable amount of time and resources identifying the cause behind an incident, hampering their ability to protect drivers from risks such as fraudulent claims.
Fleet operators are well-insured, and in many states are strictly liable for losses caused by drivers, making them prime targets for insurance fraud. Meanwhile, nuclear verdicts (where jury penalties exceed $10 million) threaten both fleet owners and insurers.
Video telematics provides data-driven evidence that can play a crucial role when it comes to exonerating drivers and mitigating fraud. A fully integrated telematics solution can accurately detect crashes, alert operators to the event, and almost immediately upload video footage of the critical seconds before, during, and after impact.
These accurate situational details leave little room for doubt and can help companies understand the root cause of an accident. If a car slams on the brakes in front of the fleet vehicle or swerves into its lane, irrefutable video evidence can protect fleet drivers from being unfairly blamed for the event.
When cameras detect a visual trigger from another motorist on the road, drivers can prove they exercised safety protocols on the road by leveraging video evidence to exonerate themselves. Exoneration would also help operators protect a company’s reputation, and you can’t really put a price on that.
Rapid access to data-driven evidence means expedited collision investigations and faster claims processing. A more efficient claims process can lower overall fleet costs related to collisions and may also help reduce insurance premiums, all thanks to fleet telematics.
Fleet maintenance to keep vehicles safeNo matter how cautious and safe a fleet’s drivers are, ensuring overall safe operation begins with proper vehicle maintenance.
Fleet management applications that deliver a dashboard of data insights captured from a telematics device can alert fleet managers to low battery levels, excessive hours of use, engine fault lights or other potential mechanical problems that could lead to unsafe vehicles.
They can track when maintenance service is needed, enabling managers to schedule and prioritize repairs and regular maintenance checks. These customizable alerts provide fleet managers with greater visibility into vehicle operations to potentially prevent mechanical failures, keep drivers safe, and maintain vehicle uptime. Proper, timely maintenance also reduces the chances of vehicles breaking down on the side of the road, which can pose a safety threat to stranded drivers.
The bottom lineFleet managers are often forced to switch between several applications, giving them a highly fragmented view of daily operations, wasting valuable time and increasing frustration.
Fully integrated fleet management solutions provide fleets of all sizes with a unified view of their operations to manage a broader range of vehicles and drivers more effectively.
Data is only as good as the sense you can make of it. Actionable intelligence, delivered in near real time, is what moves the needle.
A fully integrated video intelligence solution gives fleet managers a competitive advantage through increased visibility of their operations. This level of visibility can open up the doors to strategically and digitally transform their operations for the long term and, ultimately, secure their role in the evolution of fleet operations.

By Shubhankar GautamIn areas, both big and small, parking systems are a headache for both commuters and city governments. Most resident parking, pay, and display systems are either overcrowded or not adequately located. One of the best ways to tackle both these issues is by using park and ride systems in urban areas.
What Are “Park and Ride” systems?
Thousands of residents use private transport to travel to work, make grocery runs, or catch up with friends. All these activities are necessary but end up crowding the roads, mainly if everyone uses a separate car. While carpooling is a viable solution, it won’t work entirely if different people have the same route but various destinations in mind.
That is where a system like Park and Ride systems can reduce the number of vehicles on the road. Under Park and Ride systems, commuters park their private cars in designated parking spots, which are well connected with public transport hubs. They then use public transportation to cover the remaining distance to their destination.
This intermodal parking and transport system is already being practiced in thousands of cities in various countries. In places where “Park and Ride” has been systematically implemented, it has helped reduce traffic congestions, thus improving public transport usage and better organizing parking systems.
Advantages of Park and Ride systems
Some salient features of every park and ride system are as follows.
Park and ride systems improve urban mobility to a large extent. As several private vehicles are not used simultaneously, traffic congestion reduces, which in turn, reduces commute time. The system also encourages public transport usage and generates more revenue for city governments.Carpooling, an effective way to reduce both pollution and traffic congestion in urban areas, becomes the most popular when well-planned park and ride locations are introduced throughout a city. As people do not have to struggle with finding a fellow rider the whole way to a destination, they also embrace traveling with a friend or a family member more readily.Even people from suburban areas benefit from a park and ride system as residents traveling to the city center need not waste fuel commuting hundreds of miles each day. They can instead drive to a park and ride lot and use public transit from there to enter the city. This advantage, however, is apparent only when the park and ride lots are also situated on the outskirts of a town.
Any park and ride location is best when located away from sites of heavy congestion. While easily accessible, these areas should not be located very close to places that remain heavily crowded, especially during peak hours. These locations should also be well connected with public transport networks so that they are incentivizing enough for all commuters. Once a municipality decides to construct a park and ride lot, steps must be taken for proper implementation and maintenance. It must be kept clean and should not be overly expensive.
Considering the host of advantages this system offers and the relatively small investment, it demands, park and ride lots are a future-proof way of reducing traffic congestion in urban areas. They also make cities more pleasant for both commuters and tourists, and when planned carefully, they have very few downsides. For cities looking to turn smart, park and ride is a must-adopt system.

With a pandemic gripping our world right now, busy roads seem like a thing of the past. That is, however, hardly true. As soon as life starts getting back on track, traffic congestion will be back in full force, and city governments will struggle immeasurably with traffic management. 
Urban areas, both big and small, will return to day-long traffic jams and significantly longer commute times. Such problems affect the ordinary citizen the most, and every city looking to turn smart must first tackle them. Here are some truly “smart” ways to fight to overcrowd and reduce traffic congestion with smart city tech in urban areas. These apply to cities of all sizes and have already been employed successfully by many city governments.
Traffic Light Optimization
Smart programming and digitization can be used to control traffic light operations in both large and small urban areas. When traffic lights co-ordinate ideally and respond to demand in real-time, road capacity can be maximized quickly. Smart traffic lights can also be synced to the movement of larger vehicles or conditioned to respond appropriately to situations like gridlock or blockage. All of this programming can be done with expert knowledge of the non-linear relationship between traffic flow and delay.
Parking Zone Extension
The exacerbation of traffic congestion in urban areas is mostly a result of limited parking spaces. Even in larger cities, controlled parking zones are limited to certain main streets. There is usually an unbalanced mix of residents’ parking, pay and display, and limited wait parking zones.
 The best way to tackle congestion is to extend parking controls away from the city center and formulate smart parking zones, even in less crowded areas. To enhance their functioning further, these parking zones can have virtual permits, 1-hour time limits, and regular patrolling by civil law enforcement officers. Making them smart would mean collecting real-time data on commuter parking and directing the crowd to emptier zones accordingly.
Autonomous Vehicle Usage
While using autonomous or self-driven vehicles will not reduce congestion quantitatively, it will help manage traffic in a more advanced fashion. Without human intervention, smart cars can practice effective collision management, discover new roads to reach a destination, platoon perfectly, and gather data about free and empty parking zones to decide the best parking spot. Moreover, smart vehicles will also eliminate traffic jams caused solely due to human error. All of these combined reduce both commute time and congestion well.
Pedestrian Traffic Monitoring
Smart city management authorities should not blatantly assume that the sole cause of traffic congestion is vehicle traffic. Pedestrian traffic, when ignored, is equally worrying. Having realized this, cities like Las Vegas and Los Angeles are using V2I technology to monitor pedestrian traffic and reroute vehicle traffic accordingly. The data thus collected is also useful in traffic light optimization to increase road safety. For instance, Los Angeles is making the data gathered public to real estate developers and locality planners to help them build residential complexes in locations that experience less congestion.
Drone Usage by City Management
This is one of the best ideas to reduce traffic congestion with smart city tech. With the development of IoT based drones, most tasks that once needed inspectors, repair and delivery professionals, or city officials to travel in vehicles can now be done via drone cameras. Smart cities that employ drones to carry out minor repair tasks and most inspection tasks can quickly reduce the number of trucks and buses on the road, especially during peak hours. Even private companies like Amazon are now experimenting with drone-based deliveries in highly congested cities, and there’s no reason governments can’t do the same.
Levying Workplace Parking Charges
Most workplaces offer their employees the option of free parking. This incentive encourages people to commute to the office every day in separate cars since they don’t have to pay anything to park at the office even for long hours. A workplace parking fee is known to have a significant effect on both congestion and pollution. Levying a charge on workplace parking can be useful in promoting carpooling amongst employees, which will, in turn, reduce congestion on roads. It will also improve public transport usage and allow both private and public firms to re-evaluate their parking space usage.
Building V2I Smart Corridors
Using V2I technology to make roads smarter is one of the best ways to reduce congestion in cities. Using connected video cameras and satellite imaging, drivers can be informed about accidents and weather-related alerts as they drive on particular roads and expressways. These roads would act as smart transit corridors, where all the vehicle drivers would have information about the conditions about to welcome them in the next few miles. They can then decide to reroute from a congested road or slow down to avoid further crowding.
These innovative methods require minimal spending and are long-term solutions suitable for even the most heavily congested cities. Governments need to plan well, use IoT, AI, and digitization, and respond timely to a crisis, to make urban roads smooth for commuters at all hours of the day.

What will our future cities, and the infrastructure that helps them function, look like? With so much industry evolution, the answer to this is continually changing. This year’s Critical Infrastructure Summit held an industry panel bringing together some of the best minds in infrastructure delivery and city planning to explore this and look at the impact of digital technologies, future mobility, sustainability and accessibility on the future of the sector.
The industry panel was sponsored by Nearmap and held during the Summit’s final session Future of Infrastructure. The panellists were Damian Gould, CEO, Building Queensland; Marion Terrill, Transport and Cities Program Director, Grattan Institute Melbourne; and Stephen Neale, Product Manager – 3D, Nearmap. COVID-19 showed us how quickly things can change in just a few months, with the pandemic impacting the way people use infrastructure in Australia.
While it’s still uncertain if these changes in behaviour will be temporary or permanent, it does bring up the question: do we need to be rethinking the way we plan our cities? Marion noted that as Australia and the world is still dealing with COVID, it’s unclear what the end state will be.
“We’re not yet in a stable situation where we know where we’re standing, so it’s a time of high uncertainty. I think that does affect the way that we plan cities as we have to plan them to be resilient to a range of possible future scenarios,” Marion said.
She said there are a few things that we know for certain have changed, including the fact that population growth has ground to halt with the closing of international borders, and that there has been a move out of public transport and into cars – with cities having to learn to manage the switch in demand.
“It’s very much an open question as to whether we will get back to the levels of population growth that we’ve seen in the last decade or so, and that’s important because the business cases for a lot of urban infrastructure have been underpinned by population growth,” Marion said.
“The other thing I would raise in terms of how we think about planning cities in a world with COVID, is that it has a big impact on people’s transport choices, and we’re certainly seeing that at the moment in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.”
Damian’s work with Building Queensland helps drive the development of the state’s major infrastructure business cases so he views the planning and development of our major cities on a more project-specific basis.
“Clearly COVID has demonstrated that when developing the business case for a major transport project, even if you stress test the assumptions and come up with different scenarios, no one could have dreamt that we’d have a scenario where public transport patronage went down by 80 per cent,” Damian said.
“Now those levels are starting to come back up again but it’s a slow transition, and people are starting to see some of the immediate impacts around increased traffic congestion.”
He said COVID has put into question previous assumptions around where main population nodes will be, both in terms of where people decide to live and how employment hubs, transport and other requirements will connect and service citizens.
“I think some of the more immediate learnings that have come out of COVID is thinking more about how you manage the flow of people, or try to build into the design process some element of how people can physically distance. There’s a recognition of those sort of perimeters being built into individual matters like building and asset design.”
Stephen Neale from Nearmap agreed and also pointed out that the data gathered over years and years that outlines long-term trends has now been flipped on its head. “This situation has changed very quickly and the predictions and the models that we may have had previously don’t quite apply now, so we need to think about how we can plan for the future and make decisions with new trends not apparent in past data,” Stephen said.
Industry risks and challenges
Damian believes that the most enduring challenge for Australia’s infrastructure and cities will be the appropriate planning and security of water supply to major cities and regional centres, which he says is an emerging issue in several parts of Queensland.
In addition, he said that there needs to be a focus on health and a requirement to evolve and embrace digital healthcare. “We really need to make sure the physical and digital assets continue to address the emerging and growing service needs in healthcare,” Damian said.
While for Marion, the biggest challenge she sees is the way that infrastructure decisions made by the government are often politicised.
“By way of example, I could say most major projects are committed to without actually having a business case, and sometimes one is done after, but it is more often than not, not actually informing the decision to invest.
“The reason that this matters is that we are in a changing world; we are facing these challenges, particularly around climate change, sustainability and the pandemic, and we need to make good infrastructure decisions – and they need to be able to change when the circumstances around us change.
“I feel that there is a substantial challenge, or risk really, facing future investment in infrastructure because we seem to be stuck in a manner of decision-making that isn’t really serving us very well,” Marion said.
Digitally connected infrastructure
Australia’s infrastructure is constantly evolving and becoming more digitally connected, and the panel talked about the technological advancements they think will have the biggest impact on our cities in the future. Stephen said there are organisations rolling out 5G infrastructure across Australia which provides access to real-time communication.
“As that infrastructure is being rolled out we start to realise that idea of real-time communication. If we have real-time sensors and real-time communication we can allow things like vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and vehicle-to infrastructure communication.
“Having worked in the car navigation industry in the past, there was this one picture of the future that really stood out to me, and it was this concept of communication between vehicles and infrastructure that meant we no longer needed traffic lights – cars could speak to each other and cross each other at intersections without causing any accidents.
“This sort of decision-making is actually a realisation of the technology that’s evolving out there now. This 5G technology is enabling communication, and real-time sensors are setting us up for this huge wealth of data that’s coming in, and what we need to do now is come up with the decision-making frameworks to best use that data.”
For Damian, he sees huge potential in the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. “There’s current pilots looking at that in the context of how to better predict project outcomes from a cost and scheduling perspective. But the applications for assessing the demand for infrastructure that will inform business cases and design processes is important.”
While Marion is excited that the technology is now sufficiently developed to make it realistic to introduce congestion charging. “It’s a real opportunity for our cities. I know it’s kind of political poison, but particularly in a world of COVID where people’s instinct is to go out in the car and not worry about their own contribution to slowing everyone else down, charging a small congestion charge is a counter to that so people who can be flexible take their trip at a different time of day,” Marion said.
“It seems to me that in lots of ways it has been difficult to contemplate congestion charging schemes because the technology was not great, but I think that has changed now. To me it’s game-changing in terms of what we can do and how we can get more out of the infrastructure that we’ve already got.”
Sustainable assets for the future
Marion said the main thing that’s important when it comes to sustainability is to be robust to a range of future scenarios. “What’s important here is that in mature cities, you’ve got most of the infrastructure that you’re ever going to have really, so that you use it as effectively as you can and that you look after it properly.
“There are service gaps, so to think about what is a sustainable city, it is a vibrant and inclusive place where people can get around, so that they don’t have to operate in a disconnected village. Sustainability for me is a lot about accessibility and connectedness, but it’s about the stewardship of what we have and using it to the best effect.”
Damian said the industry needs to think about future scenarios as it tries to plan infrastructure investments to provide services over a project’s 20-30 year lifespan – from what’s the demand, to how do you design and configure the relevant infrastructure solutions to meet that service need.
“It’s a bit of a mind shift in taking it beyond the benefits of this transport project, such as travel time savings for commuters and car users, and a reduction in operating costs. It’s looking at what are the broader societal implications and benefits and how do you structure the narrative around that,” Damian said.

Autonomous driving is one of the most disruptive developments we’ve seen to this day. It will change the way we think of cities, roads, parking, commuting, leisure, ownership, and will spawn new jobs as the business models unfold. Many open questions have answers in business models, infrastructure, technology direction, and development.
Transportation as a Service
Many automotive OEMs believe that transportation is set for fundamental disruption and will be very different in the future. OEMs like BMW sell directly to consumers today but experimenting with ridesharing, fleet sales, time splitting, etc., creating Transportation as a Service (TaaS) business models. On-demand business models will alter profit pool configurations in the transportation industry with value shifting to technology, data, design, and platforms and away from dealerships or hardware.
Operating System Enabled Value Chain
Operating systems are the heartbeat of any ecosystem but have been monetized differently by technology players. Apple (iOS) charges a premium for hardware, and Google (Android) drives more advertising revenue. At the same time, Microsoft (Windows) is monetized directly -control of the OS is vital to the autonomous driving value chain as it impacts customer experiences and relationships through control.
Both Detroit and Silicon Valley are in a race to create and control this Operating System. While Tesla mimics the iOS model, Baidu is looking at “open source” technology to monetize ancillary products/services, and Uber is building a partner ecosystem to create scale.Autonomous driving is quickly becoming a reality, Here are various business models that can help enable and drive the value chain for businesses.Click To Tweet
Multiple models will likely emerge, co-exist, and compete, impacting capitalization, scale, margins, marketing, sales, and future investments. The Tesla-style business model will be aesthetically appealing, given the hardware focus building exceptional design. The Baidu model will be hinging on design and driving up accessories, services, support, etc. The right package and quantity of sensors will also depend on the OS strategy adopted, impacting ancillary players’ value. Open and closed strategies for the OS, (e.g., iOS vs. Android), will also create consequences like safety legislation, competitive dynamics, standardization of infrastructure, and more.
Fleets and Logistics
The existing approach to logistics would change by eliminating constraints around commercial fleets today. These include driving hour limitations, better asset utilization, less downtime, faster movement of goods, reduced congestion, and improved operating costs.
Governments have been considering autonomous only zones and reduced need for parking lots. New business specialties and opportunities will emerge in urban planning and management/monitoring of fleets through new players. Fleets create business models around access frequency, usage time, or miles consumed. Given the long depreciation cycles of existing fleets and cost factors to create AV fleets, semi-autonomous or retrofit capabilities are a short-term revenue stream.
Data-Driven Value Chain
Autonomous vehicles will consume and generate data at unprecedented levels. The data comes from various sources and components like cameras, radars, lidars, GPS, sensors, maps, and smart infrastructure. All this data must be aggregated in real-time and trained to navigate roads, avoid obstacles, provide safety, comply with rules, and create personalized experiences.  The volume, velocity, and intake of this data will require new infrastructure, software-defined processing capabilities, and new business models. Many partnerships have evolved to co-create new data sets or have access to it like HD maps.
Initially, this data must be trained by humans and machine learning models––“human in the loop” method ––while deep learning will occur in the cloud, machine learning executes on the vehicle itself. The ownership, consumption, and monetization of all this data will inform business models as multiple new startups emerge only around this data value chain.
Software Defined Value Chain
Technology companies create value by commoditizing suppliers and monetizing consumers through efficient channels. In transportation, ridesharing companies like Uber and Lyft have also aggregated demand through a channel (platform technology) and commoditized the supply side, making the vehicle type less important for riders. Uber and Lyft both want to consolidate their positions as the future focal point of transportation by investing in autonomous driving initiatives.
Many players like Google, legacy OEMs, new players like Tesla, and auto suppliers are competing in the value chain. The electrification of cars, fleets, and the viability of new powertrains will directly impact AVs’ fixed and operating costs. A new transportation and mobility ecosystem is expected to be faster, cheaper, cleaner, safer, more customized, and more efficient in all aspects. The higher end of the value chain will create stronger positions to foundations to accelerate this nascent but promising sector.
Internet of Vehicles and V2X
Business models leveraging multiple modes of C-V2X include infotainment, traffic information, real-time mapping, telematics, and data analytics. Network-based data analytics, monitoring, and opportunities also exist. While V2I might be delayed due to a lack of incentives with local governments to progress and their budget deficits, they will be significant influencers of business models, including access to services and space access.
Regulation Driven Business Models
Regulators have struggled with Big Tech, and vice versa as rapid technological advances are challenging to keep current. Regulators are important stakeholders in the autonomous driving revolution and influence players for migrating to lower pollution, less congestion, and efficient commutes.  They also must consider the transition time from human-driven to autonomous driving, factoring a period of co-existence.
The distribution of economic value will be interesting for regulators as the industry evolves. For example, if taxes are levied on miles traveled, incentives will be to stay closer to centers of action, but if taxes are driven by hours parked or space occupied, business models, will shift to minimize idle time. It will be a chicken and egg situation between industry guiding regulation and letting regulation direct the industry’s future.
Business models and profit motives will inform technology, regulatory and societal adoption of autonomous driving. This is an ecosystem play with value created outside of traditional automakers, including Technology, Media, Telecom, Insurance, Healthcare, Energy, and Government.

German lawmakers agreed to allow some driverless vehicles on public roads, a first step toward enabling autonomous driving in Europe’s biggest economy.
Lawmakers in the lower house of parliament adopted legislation enabling automated driving under some conditions. The bill, approved late May 20, cites scenarios including small buses and logistics vehicles that can shuttle passengers and goods along pre-determined routes.
Next-level technologies hold the potential to enhance safety and efficiency in transportation, but it takes a lot of work behind the scenes to advance these ideas from concept to reality. We talk with Christoph Mertz of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon and Huei Peng of the University of Michigan. Hear a snippet above, and get the full program by going to RoadSigns.TTNews.com.
“This is the world’s first legal framework for autonomous driving in regular operation,” Ulrich Lange, a deputy leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s bloc in parliament, said in a statement May 21.
Germany is keen to catch up in the field of autonomous driving, a technology that could reshape the transport industry but is enormously complex and costly. The biggest advances so far have been made by Waymo and Cruise in the U.S. as well as Baidu Inc. in China.
The legislation allows for Level 4 autonomy — meaning a vehicle that can drive itself under certain conditions. For a car to qualify, Germany requires that a human is able to shut it down in case of issues, either by sitting inside it or accessing it remotely, according to the bill.
The German government expects projects next year. The upper house of parliament still needs to approve the legislation.

Wise Systems developed an automated route planning and execution system for last-mile fleets to optimize the delivery experience for their customers.
Investments in the last-mile transportation and logistics sector have been soaring for companies that are not directly competing with the delivery models of UPS, FedEx and the United States Postal Service.
One of the hottest commodities in the last-mile sector has been the same-day delivery of food, beverage and grocery items. Since 2011, funding for crowdsourced delivery platforms such as Instacart and Uber Eats reached $14 billion, according to Deloitte research.
Other fast growing segments include big and bulky freight deliveries and items with extra-sensitive service requirements like medical samples and supplies.
No matter the freight type, delivery expectations in the last-mile sector are driven by Amazon, which currently fulfills 72% of orders for Prime customers within 24 hours.
The defining moment in Amazon’s last-mile strategy was its 2018 launch of the Delivery Service Partner (DSP) program. Since then, Amazon has been contracting with local delivery companies to compete directly with UPS and FedEx on a massive scale. Today the DSP program counts more than 1,300 delivery firms and 20,000 delivery vans in its ranks worldwide.
One of the benefits for fleets that are Amazon DSPs is having access to sophisticated delivery technology, but the downside is the ease with which the world’s largest online retailer cuts contracts. This has forced many local delivery fleets to search for new opportunities.
Down to the last footWith the amount of investment dollars and capacity flowing into the last mile segment, some technology companies have found opportunities to give fleets a competitive edge by solving complex routing problems.
Generally, fleets have a majority of their deliveries planned in advance for the next day but need to dynamically add stops to these routes for 30% to 40% of orders that come in during the day with same-day delivery expectations.
Solving complex routing problems has positioned some companies to offer fleets an automated dispatch process, which will be even more valuable when autonomous vehicles arrive on the scene.
In 2014, the prospects for using autonomous vehicles for last-mile delivery were bright, and the founders of Wise Systems saw a market opportunity to develop autonomous dispatch, route planning and execution software for last-mile delivery companies.
Wise Systems is not a technology company like Instacart or Uber Eats that is trying to operate in the logistics space. Rather, it offers its technology to fleets. Although the arrival of autonomous delivery vehicles did not happen as originally planned, fleets are using the software to optimize route planning and execution down to the final feet of deliveries, said Ali Kamil, chief technology officer and co-founder of Wise Systems.
The cloud-based software captures time, location and other route data every few seconds from an app that runs on mobile devices. The software knows when drivers arrive, when they get to a customer’s door and when they depart.
With this granular level of data capture — which includes the number and weight of delivery units — the software predicts how long it will take to complete future deliveries at each customer location. It also learns from repeat visits to determine the best way to enter, the best spot to park and the best time to visit to expedite the delivery process.
“Collecting all of this data enables us to learn,” Kamil said, “so we can plan better tomorrow.”
The mobile driver app is easy to use and helps drivers make more money by completing more deliveries each day. “Drivers don’t want to be spending time monkeying around,” he noted. “It needs to be quick and easy.”
Fleets that use the software can dynamically add stops into a route optimization engine and give their customers access to a web portal for tracking the status of deliveries. The end customer can also sign up to receive text or email notifications.
The end customer can get real-time expected time of arrival with accuracy down to five minutes, he said. With this level of visibility, “what we are enabling for customers is a better and faster delivery experience than Amazon,” he said. “We are not just going accept that Amazon is going to dominate.”

When the technology press talks about the supply chain of the future, it tends to focus on some of the clichés that, while they spark the imagination, tend to veer closer to science fiction than reality.
For logistics and deliveries, there are often mentions of self-driving trucks or drones that can handle last-mile delivery. For depots, distributions, and warehouses, the images are ones of massive aircraft-hangar-sized warehouses without a human soul on site, entirely staffed by robots.
To a certain extent, there are some elements of truth in these visions. Robots do play an increasing part in many warehouses across the world, and while driverless trucks are still safely in testing stages, entire worldwide fleets of all types of transport are carefully tracked and scheduled by advanced technologies.
In practical terms, many challenges face supply chain and logistics managers today that can and are being solved by technology. This series of articles hopes to describe some of the more exciting solutions, and focus on the ones that make practical business sense in 2021. Issues like peaks in demand over national festivals and shopping events, the need to dramatically cut carbon emissions to keep delivery trucks rolling through many of the world’s cities: these are among the many issues that concern supply chain professionals today.
Iterate to improve
Day-to-day operations require changes that create little-and-often improvements. These improvements are then reflected in today’s businesses’ order books and finance software, from those of ocean-going freight operators through bike delivery outfits. In this series of articles, we hope to look at some of the more practical technology-based solutions that make significant differences in several areas of the supply chain and logistics industry.
As an area of technological evolution, our vertical is particularly exciting because of its interconnected nature. Change and improvements in one niche area, like improvements in loading bay metrics, can cause an increased need for improvement in digital connectivity further up and down the chain. As an integrated and organic system, the supply chain, and the elements in it, are an area that is one to watch for anyone with an interest in how technologies are changing business.
For the operations manager in any business anywhere in the supply chain, keeping tabs on the rest of the industry is very necessary: changes to platforms, practices and protocols will indubitably have their effects felt close to home, sooner or later.
In this opening article, we’ll be considering four technical innovators in the industry, vendors whose solutions and practical offerings will make that significant difference to operations. From vehicle fleet management, through picking and warehouse robots, to integration with varying government Customs APIs for import/export, to e-commerce platforms — the intermeshed supply chains and logistics networks that cover the globe are a hotbed of technological innovation.
Here is our opening salvo of four vendors: these are the movers and shakers in this hotbed of technology that is the supply chain of the modern age.
GEEK+
Smart logistics solutions are what Geek+ delivers all over the world today. Right now, its robots and control systems create automations across facility shop floors that drive efficiency, increase the flexibility of the supply chain, and lower costs. The cut in labor costs is significant, and so are reductions in associated overheads caused by mistakes, accidents, and holdups from any source.
Throughout seasonal peaks and troughs of consumer demand, Geek+ platform continues to adapt and provide solutions across the multiple industries, including e-commerce, retail, 3PL, pharmaceutical, and more.
The solution creates technology infrastructure that can pre-emptively adjust the supply chain according to prevailing conditions — that’s down to the information flows that happen in real-time. Day-to-day operations are revolutionized, the business becomes more agile, and its partners benefit too.
Planning and facilitating real-time events can become a fully automated process, with robotized pickers and warehouse robots maximizing capacity on the fly, ensuring human operators work more productively and safely. The Geek+ advantage is one of being able to be proactive rather than reactive to business. It offers modernization of facilities; via the platform, the positive effects spread out across the enterprise through synchronized data and visibility of information silos with benefits beyond the supply chain, allowing the whole business to thrive.

GEOTAB
As a global leader in IoT and connected transportation with over 2.2 million connected vehicles, Geotab provides advanced data insights and fleet management solutions to organizations all over the world, including thousands of logistics companies. Its interoperability with other technology platforms is unrivaled as proven through its vast ecosystem of partners. By implementing Geotab’s technology, many organizations have revolutionized the way they operate through increased fleet efficiency, improved driver safety and reduced maintenance costs.
By monitoring vehicles and driver behavior, companies can unlock a wealth of metrics and performance data that can positively affect every part of the business. Maintenance plans for machinery and vehicles can be honed to help keep investments running for longer, yet performing more optimally, safely, and with greater fuel or power efficiency. Even small details like vehicle movements across depots or yards can yield powerful information that help increase management’s visibility and enable data-driven insights to change operations for the better.
Geotab’s innovations are centered around six pillars: Productivity, Fleet Optimization, Safety, Compliance, Expandability and most recently, Sustainability. These pillars are strategically selected to ensure that the customers’ business remains relevant in a world that is experiencing rapid social, economic, environmental and technological change.

ANCHANTO
Anchanto’s solution was born and bred in Asia, and its multilingual support on the platform (customizable for each user) means it’s the go-to in the APAC for many in the industry. The GUI transitions neatly and clearly from English through Japanese, Mandarin, Bahasa, among others, and provides oversight and management of inventory, order, pricing, and discrete catalogs.
The Anchanto solutions also “speak computer,” integrating via open-standard APIs into other enterprise systems. Companies can tie together logistics, supply chain, and, for instance, internal finance, HR, and CRM systems. Even outside the company’s logistics operations, staff feel the benefits, as previously manual copying & pasting from one system to another gets fully automated.
The Anchanto eCommerce management system (SelluSeller) integrates with 70+ marketplaces common in the region, from niche specialists up to the giants: the likes of Lazada, Flipkart, and Tmall. It handles ordering and fulfillment processes from marketplaces and other websites — including your own e-commerce facilities — and then co-ordinates the supply chain for a fully inclusive service that puts customers’ experiences first.
For warehousing and stock control, the Wareo platform handles stock expiry dates, SKU lists, re-ordering, consignment notes, delivery orders, and so on – the list is long enough that it’s best read on the company’s website!

FLEXPORT
Flexport’s mainstay offering is around all things sea-going and ocean freight forwarding. Full load shipments and multi-port partial loads are tracked, either being carried the company’s own network of vessels or across the common major shipping alliances. That means exceptions (so much part of ocean freight) can be immediately acted on, with operations staff alerted via the highly customizable dashboard that gives a literal worldwide view of real-time activities.
This type of insight plays a critical role in a connected supply chain for companies bound by SLAs or those on a journey to improve metrics and customer experiences. To push this goal more effectively and reduce costs for all its clients, Flexport offers partners container-space-to-requirement matching service. When there’s unused space, it can be offered to other Flexport clients, helping both parties achieve better efficiency and slash consignment costs.
The Flexport solution integrates with truck and air logistics, too, with a highly extensible system that boasts fully ready-to-go APIs for inter-connectivity. There is also a customs and duties facilitation service, which means companies get direct electronic access to filing and rebate systems right across the world. That feature alone saves literally hundreds of hours spent filing paper records with multiple agencies.

Logistics leaders say lack of visibility, automation, and innovative technology is keeping them from optimizing last-mile delivery demands.
More than half of respondents to a recent industry survey say they will add automation to meet growing last-mile delivery volumes, with many pointing to outdated technology as a roadblock to delivering on last-mile promises.
Technology vendor Bringg surveyed 200 logistics professionals at companies with 200 to 50,000 employees for its State of Last Mile Logistics report, released this week. The survey polled workers in North America and Western Europe and found that the growth of e-commerce, customer expectations, and rising last-mile delivery volumes have created a capacity problem that logistics providers are struggling to fill.
More than 60% of respondents said they have seen increased demand for last-mile delivery, but noted that a lack of visibility, automation, and innovative technology is “holding them back” from meeting those demands, according to the survey. More than 40% said their biggest challenge to scaling last-mile operations is outdated business processes and manual operations, followed by legacy technology (36%).
“This past year has forced retailers and service providers to assess their supply chain agility and resilience,” Guy Bloch, Bringg CEO, said in a statement. “While they want to take advantage of growing opportunities in the world of ecommerce, they are challenged by legacy systems, limited visibility and high operational costs.”Key findings indicate a greater emphasis on tech tools for the last-mile:
53% of respondents said their shippers use or have requested real-time visibility tools for end customers, but just 18% of providers have it—and more than half said they have no plans to purchase those tools.54% of logistics providers said they are focused on adding automation to improve customer service; 41% said they have already done so.20% of respondents said they’ve abandoned automated scheduling and self-scheduling because it was too expensive, but 61% said this was the top wish-list item from shippers.64% said they are planning to offer new premium services and service plans to increase business through last-mile operations this year, while 43% said intelligent and easy integrations that enable multiple delivery models is the technology that will most help them win business.

Transportation is one of the fastest changing and most exciting sectors in the global economy today. Connected and autonomous vehicles, shared mobility concepts, and the shift to electric vehicles are some of the most exciting avenues. Increasingly, the acronym, “CASE,” which stands for Connectivity, Autonomous, Sharing/Subscription and Electrification is being used to refer to this shift.
At a dedicated session on the “Future of Mobility” at the 2020 ARC Industry Forum in Orlando, Florida, four leaders in the mobility space joined us to share their perspectives and experiences around the CASE transition.
Shortcomings in Today’s Transport System
To start the session, ARC Advisory Group summarized some of the shortcomings of the current transportation system based on statistics from the US government and other sources:
There are 275 million cars on US roads, for an adult population of 250 millionThose cars have an average occupancy rate of just 1.59 peopleMost cars in the US remain parked well over 90 percent of the timeNearly 40,000 Americans die on our roads each year, mostly due to human errorOf the 200,000 annual US deaths from air pollution, 50,000 are the result of vehicle tailpipe emissionsThe transport sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the economyWorkers in the US lose over thirty billion hours and nearly $90 billion to traffic congestionUS cities are mostly built for cars – with pedestrians and urban life superseded by roads and parking spaces
These issues are driven by a century-old paradigm: the use of private, low-occupancy fossil fuel-powered vehicles for nearly every journey, operated by error-prone, and increasingly distracted, human drivers.
Addressing the issues requires changing the paradigm.
A previous Forum session focused on the shift to electric powertrains, which can help mitigate the human health and environmental impacts of our transport system.  Here, we focus on mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) and connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology.  These key elements in this new paradigm offer the potential to radically improve road safety and free up non-value-added time spent driving and sitting in traffic.
What Is Mobility as a Service?
The next presentation, by Pete Costello, SVP at Iteris, a global leader in smart mobility infrastructure management, discussed the broad need for transportation, stressing its centrality to the global economy and our ever-rising standard of living. He then introduced the MaaS concept, as well as its genesis under Sampo Hietanen, industry founder and current CEO of MaaS Global (readers can hear our subsequent interview with Mr. Hietanen on the Smart Cities Podcast).
Mr. Costello explained that the mission of MaaS is to reduce the prevalence of single-occupancy vehicles to help lower pollution, increase vehicle utilization rates, and improve the human experience through “multimodal and sustainable mobility services addressing customers’ transportation needs by integrating planning and payment on a one-stop-shop principle.”
The idea is for a customer to be able to conveniently and flexibly access whatever transportation mode, or combination of modes, is needed to get to where he or she needs to go.
Possible Business Models
A customer would be presented with multiple journey options, along with their respective expected journey times, environmental footprint, calories burned, and so on.
They could pay per journey, or via a subscription. According to Mr. Costello, the subscription model emerged from an observation that for private vehicle owners in Western countries the “true cost of mobility is approximately $700-$800 per month” when vehicle maintenance, fuel, insurance, deductibles, parking, citations, inspections, government registration, taxes, and other costs are considered.  This does not include time spent at the service station, government offices, and the occasional towing yard.
Given this, a MaaS subscription providing full access to transport at a monthly cost below the private car’s true cost of mobility could prove attractive. Mobility packages with various price points and access levels may also have a role, as different customers will have different mobility needs. MaaS Global introduced its Whim app in Helsinki in 2017 and has found early success. The different plans available to Whim users in Helsinki are shown below.
Challenges for MaaS
Though MaaS holds real promise for urban mobility, it still faces plenty of challenges.
Providing access to any combination of modes through a single app requires integration with providers of different modes (ride-hail, transit, car rental, etc.) each with their own business and data processes, into a unified mobility operation, which then interacts with the customer. As Mr. Costello explained, “This is where we want to be, but it’s hard to get there. All the different entities involved are siloed, and not just in their services but their data – the accuracy of that data, its frequency, some of it real time, some of it static. How do you put that all together?”
Beyond the technical challenges, drivers are usually not aware of their true cost of mobility. This is because most costs associated with car ownership are payed relatively infrequently, while the cost of a ride-share or e-scooter is presented with every ride.
Another challenge lies in “car pride,” a concept introduced by MIT researchers studying mobility systems worldwide. According to the researchers, “The car fulfills not only instrumental transportation functions, but also holds important symbolic and affective meaning for its owners and users. In particular, owning and using a car can be a symbol of an individual’s social status or personal image.”
Lastly, since a mobility service consists of a menu of transport modes, the entire service suffers when one of these is lacking.  This means adequate public infrastructure, effective transit, and safe bike lanes are needed to make MaaS work well.
Beep’s Autonomous Shuttle Service
Our next presenter, Clayton Tino, CTO of Florida autonomous shuttle service operator Beep, argued that the future of mobility is not only shared, but also electric and, increasingly, driver-free.
The Human Factors
With the potential to reduce accidents and lower mobility costs, vehicle autonomy is an exciting element of the CASE transition. That said, introducing robot cars to the general public is untested ground. Beep’s fleet of shuttles is entirely autonomous (and electric). Having provided over 14,000 rides in a matter of months, the company has gained valuable experience in the human side of autonomy.
Having a person on board the shuttle is currently a legal requirement where Beep operates.  According to Mr. Tino, the company found the practice is also quite useful to make the passengers feel comfortable and explain all the quirks of an autonomous vehicle (AV).  He likened this to a high-tech version of early elevator operators.
Mr. Tino went on to say that the “human factors involved are huge. It’s not just the vehicle control system itself but it’s how you plan, how you account for how other vehicles and other road users interact with your service.”
The first passengers were early adopters excited about the technology, followed later by the broader community. Beep has received mostly positive feedback according to Mr. Tino, though not without bumps: “We’re starting to see more of those people becoming comfortable with the idea of autonomy. Where we’re still trying to make inroads is the other drivers in the community.  People aren’t used to interacting with AVs on the roadway…we have displays on the vehicle to tell other drivers exactly what the vehicle is doing: slowing down, stopping, turning left.”
He went on to describe continuing challenges for AV operators in adeptly interacting with disabled, elderly, and hearing or visually impaired riders, especially when the human operator is no longer present in the future.
Other Challenges
Mr. Tino cited some other challenges for AVs.  These include the still-developing sophistication of self-driving software and high vehicle costs, which are mostly driven by the price of the sensor suite. Beyond technology, he noted that the lack of standardized safety validation process from the federal government results in the company having to comply with piecemeal regulation that varies from one jurisdiction to the next.
In the panel discussion that followed, one panelist mentioned that someday autonomous operation will be just boring. Mr. Tino responded, “If one day it’s boring that means we’ve done something very right because things are going really well.”
Autonomous System Testing
Our next presenter was Professor Harish Chintakunta from the Advanced Mobility Institute at Florida Polytechnic Institute. His group tests autonomous systems.  In his talk, he argued that autonomous vehicles are necessary to reduce motor accidents, but this transition must be implemented properly. Dr. Chintakunta notes that we tolerate significant human error on roads but will accept a far lower accident rate from AVs and public opinion can easily turn away from them.
Autonomous vehicles rely on sensors, including cameras, radar, and lidar, to see their environment. According to Dr. Chintakunta, this is where the long list of unknowns begins for mass AV adoption. “In the future let’s say if all vehicles have lidar, there’s a heavy concentration of lasers in that area, so we don’t know what the result will be.  If a single test vehicle is working properly, it may happen that multiple vehicles may not work properly.”
Ethical Questions
Sensor data is collected and then processed by the vehicle’s algorithms.  These must make sometimes-critical choices, introducing difficult questions that extend beyond the realm of engineering. “When you’re talking about algorithms, you also want to test whether they take into consideration ethical issues…so there’s all sorts of ethical issues when it comes to autonomous systems, for example do you want your vehicle to save passengers or pedestrians? If you have a chance to save three people by swerving and hitting another person, do you want to do that?”
Other ethical questions arise as well. When autonomous taxis compete as mobility services aiming to maximize passenger time, will they be programmed to travel quickly (and with higher risk) when empty to pick up the next fare sooner?
According to Dr. Chintakunta, “We don’t want to be making decisions on what’s ethical as testers, we leave that to regulators and system designers, but we want to provide a mechanism for them to encode these aspects into the testing process.”
Human Machine Interaction
Lastly, Dr. Chintakunta introduced the element of human-AV communication and how machines will interact with the language of driving that we all use without thinking much about it. “There may be situations when your turn signal isn’t working, and you may put your hand out the window. Can an autonomous vehicle understand that? We have all these implicitly understood notions, so we have to start formalizing them and build a language and evaluate how systems are dealing with this.”

WE WERE PROMISED SELF-DRIVING CARS before the end of the last decade, and those predictions are turning out to be wildly, hilariously wrong. But things may be catching up — and the loser of the pack, according to Sam Abuelsamid of Guidehouse Insights, is Tesla, which may surprise droves of Elon-stans.
“Of course there is also the elephant in the room that is Tesla,” Abuelsamid tells Inverse. “To be honest, I’m not sure they really belong in this group at all, but the company and CEO have been so insistent that they are developing ‘full self-driving’ … and they get most of the attention from media and financial markets that I felt they should be here just to demonstrate where they actually stand.”
It’s not as if it’s been an easy road for anyone involved in the autonomous industry. We’re firmly in the trough of disillusionment as autonomous car companies bite the dust, are scooped up by well-funded competitors, or simply take much longer to reach fruition than we thought.
The Trough of Disillusionment is part of something called the Gartner Hype Cycle, and it follows the Peak of Inflated Expectations. Remember that? Back in the mid-2010s, when Uber and Google were going to launch robotaxis in every city around the world, and before we knew it, the streets would be safer and greener, and then all those predictions turned out to be total bunk.
But never fear, the hype cycle of overpromising and underdelivering and dashed hopes and sunken dreams has a happy ending. Though many companies remain cautious, we’ve seen real progress in the self-driving car world over the past year, according to Abuelsamid.
One thing is different this year, however. “For the first time, the focus is on the companies developing the automated driving systems rather than those that will deploy the technology on the road,” he says. “Thus we have Argo AI instead of Ford and VW and Aurora instead of Uber or Toyota.”
Unless you’re a serious autonomous car buff, it’s likely that you won’t recognize most of the names listed, but you will, soon enough. Here’s a look at the leaders from the 2021 Guidehouse Insights Leaderboard.
Guidehouse Insights
TESLA HAS THE HYPE (AND THE MONEY)
To say that the report is critical of Tesla is underselling it a little bit. Not only does Tesla score at the bottom of the pile when it comes to execution, but it’s also even further behind on strategy.
“Tesla’s approach to testing its system is fundamentally at odds with virtually every other company in this industry,” claims the report, which is available in full for $3,950 on the Guidehouse Insights website. Regardless of what Elon Musk claims, Tesla explicitly says in its operating instructions that “Full-Self Driving” requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel, ready to take control at all times.
“The hands-on, eyes-on requirement essentially makes FSD a driver assist system not covered by California rules and allows Tesla to market the system as more than it is,” says the report.
It’s not all bad. The report points out that Tesla has staying power, despite being close to bankruptcy several times over the years. The world’s leading electric car maker was recently worth an eye-watering $800 billion — that’s more than the next eight most valuable automakers combined. Tesla took the opportunity to sell an additional $10 billion in stock, raising valuable capital to buy itself a lot of additional runway and the cash to build several new gigafactories around the world.
Still, the Guidehouse Insights report pulls no punches:
“Tesla needs a thorough rethink of its approach to developing ADS. It has overpromised with its marketing for nearly 5 years and severely underdelivered. Until Tesla is more honest it is unlikely to improve in the rankings of this Leaderboard.”
4. THE CHINESE UPSTART: BAIDU
Baidu is the leading Chinese autonomous technology company, sporting partnerships with many companies, including Volkswagen, BMW, Ford, and a host of Chinese carmakers. It’s operating test flights without safety operators in both Beijing and California, and it has the most extensive development fleet in China.
Its Apollo system is comprehensive, utilizing “lidar, radar, and camera sensors along with cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communications all running on a custom-designed compute platform,” says Guidehouse. “Baidu already provides a range of communication, mapping, and streaming services to automakers in the Chinese market and is building on that base for its ADS (autonomous driving systems) ambitions.”
It’s well-positioned with a wide-ranging software stack but could use more hardware partners to maximize its growth opportunities in the crowded (but booming) Chinese autonomous driving market.
3. WHERE COMPETITORS COME TOGETHER: ARGO AI
While it might seem odd for competitors to invest together, lower-level autonomous technology isn’t necessarily the differentiator you might think it is. That’s why both Ford and Volkswagen have invested billions in Argo AI, the third-highest scoring company on the Guidehouse leaderboard.
“VW plans to launch its first product with Argo in 2023 using the production version of the electric ID Buzz minivan as a platform,” says Guidehouse. At the same time, Ford is working on an autonomous vehicle based on its new Escape hybrid crossover.
The report specifically calls out Argo’s testing on highways in Miami. “Highway driving capability will enable Argo-powered AVs to expand operating domains to more areas of the regions they serve,” says the report. It does note that Argo AI has not shown off its autonomous tech with public ride testing as Waymo has.
2. NOT JUST FOR CRYPTO AND CRYSIS: NVIDIA
GPU-maker Nvidia is one of the leaders in both autonomous hardware and software. The tech that makes its GPUs effective for crypto mining also makes it highly effective for neural network processing and autonomous vehicles.
“In addition to hardware, Nvidia has developed a relatively complete ADS software stack that encompasses everything needed including signal processing, perception, driving policy, and control elements,” explains the Guidehouse report. The Nvidia Drive hardware platform is rather dominant in the industry. Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler has chosen Nvidia’s Orin system on a chip and its software stack to build its next-generation electric architecture upon.
1. WHICH WAY TO WAYMO?
While it might be a surprise that Tesla is at the bottom of the rankings, the company on top shouldn’t be. Waymo, a spin-off from Google, launched fully autonomous rides for members of the public at its pilot program in Chandler, Arizona without a safety driver on board. That’s something that no other company has been able to do, aside from extremely limited trials.
Both Volvo and Stellantis (née Fiat Chrysler) have selected Waymo’s platform to power their future Level 4 self-driving vehicles, and it’s now on its fifth-generation autonomous driving stack with new, lower-cost sensors. Waymo plans both an expansion of its fully autonomous ridesharing service that is piloting in Arizona and an autonomous delivery service that will use vans from Stellantis.
Early last year, Waymo raised its first external round of financing that didn’t come solely from Alphabet/Google. “The decision to take outside investment is believed to be related to the recognition that broad deployment of AVs is not imminent,” says the Guidehouse report. “The new investment gives Waymo additional runway to grow revenue and reach profitability while reducing the spending by Alphabet.”
There’s a good chance your first ride in an autonomous robotaxi might be in a Waymo vehicle.
0. THEN THERE’S EVERYONE ELSE
The list goes on and on. Just about every legacy carmaker has invested in one or more ADS companies. And each ADS company seems to have at least one carmaker (if not more) invested in it.
While preventing vehicle crashes is a primary driver of advanced self-driving tech, it’s far from the only motivator. Driving down the cost of transportation (a self-driving Uber doesn’t need health insurance benefits and potty breaks like a human driver might) and reducing congestion are all significant factors as we look towards the city of tomorrow.
We’re still a few years away from reaching the Plateau of Productivity at the end of the hype cycle, so there’s plenty of time for both new and existing players to leap to the forefront. Still, it seems like things are about to get exciting again in the world of self-driving tech.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have defined the previous decade. Ever since the massive deployment of concepts like Big Data and cloud architecture occurred, our abilities to generate, store and process data increased by manifold. This resulted in large-scale data analytics implementations across industries and geographies, which further led to the companies incorporating AI strategies. As the companies gradually uncovered the immense potential of AI, IoT and its allied automation processes became integral to businesses as well
.The combination of AI and IoT enhances industry performance by boosting scalability and propelling operational efficiency.Click To Tweet
To put things into perspective, it’s important to understand that the usage of artificial intelligence technologies in the last four years alone has grown by 270%. Besides this, the AI development sector is also expected to be valued at around 118 billion dollars by 2025. At the other end of the spectrum is IoT. Reports reveal that in 2020 more than 30.73 billion devices were connected to an IoT infrastructure and that by the year 2025, close to 152,200 devices will connect to the internet every minute.
What Is AIoT?
For the uninitiated, AI and IoT are complimentary concepts of technology. Because data is at the fulcrum of everything, AI and IoT become the two sides of the same coin in most use cases. The term that encompasses the integration of both is called AIoT. The two technologies work in tandem to offer optimum experiences and applications to users and businesses. Several IoT mechanisms rely on artificial intelligence and its allied concepts like deep and machine learning from automation and predictive analytics.
AIoT Benefits
Artificial intelligence in IoT product development offers tons of benefits in operations, management, customer behavior analysis, and more. To offer an extensive idea, below are the benefits of AIoT:
Boosting IoT Scalability
Scalability in IoT refers to the addition of more devices in an existing ecosystem. This addition could either optimize existing processes or introduce newer features. With the integration of AI, only the required data for specific components reaches them, making the process super-specific.
For instance, a wearable health device only receives data on heart rate and vitals and not GPS and navigation information. As data crunching happens, it becomes easier to deploy newer devices in an infrastructure.
Propelling Operational Efficiency
Organizations and businesses looking to achieve optimum organizational efficiency can do this with the help of AIoT. AI in IoT can be used to detect patterns from data generated, uncover new insights that are otherwise invisible, implement predictive and preventive analytics, bring in automation, detect and fix operational loopholes, accurately predict attritions, improve employee welfare and morale, and more. With AIoT, even accurate time equipment malfunctions can be predicted for precise corrective measures. These make operations perpetual.
Incorporating New Products or Services
Several existing equipment, products, or services can be incorporated with AI concepts to bring in advanced functionalities or fully develop an AI product. For instance, voice recognition or Natural Language Processing can be implemented for advanced HMI systems, commercial fleets can be integrated with AI and IoT devices for insights generation, and to bring in advanced road and driver safety measures, websites and marketing campaigns can be made more effective and goal-driven through specific parameters and even campaign simulation mechanisms and more.
Optimize Risk Management
As we mentioned before, predictive analytics can be deployed to assess an organization’s probable risks and prevent them with pre-emptive measures. Instances like equipment malfunctioning, cyber-attacks, employee and workplace safety can be predicted, and rapid response protocols can be implemented to better tackle situations. One simple example of risk management with AI is the custom premiums on car insurance policies that completely depend on driver behavior and history.
Real-Time Monitoring and Actions
What becomes crucial with automation and IoT concepts is real-time monitoring. This helps in the consistent supervision of devices, equipment, and modules and allows systems to take decisions and actions when things go wrong autonomously. For instance, when navigation systems in vehicles detect increased traffic in a current route, real-time monitoring allows the vehicle to look for a different route and suggest it to drivers for uninterrupted driving.
Prevent Unintended Downtime
Several industries like oil and natural gas, thermal power plants, automotive factories and more cannot afford downtime, specifically when they are unplanned. They rattle schedules and planning for a specified timeframe, leading to probable losses and delayed deliveries as well.
With AIoT, unplanned downtime can be prevented thanks to predictive maintenance concepts. Based on historic data and current operating trends, machine learning algorithms can accurately predict downtime and schedule advanced servicing or even component replacement to ensure processes are uninterrupted.
Optimized Customer Experience
The volatility associated with consumer behavior has always been a challenge for businesses in delivering good customer service. With AIoT, this can be achieved by introducing new data touchpoints and aspects like heatmaps offer analysts a comprehensive idea of customer behavior.
From understanding market demands to deciphering what sells and what doesn’t, AI can allow businesses to make changes at product and product positioning levels for more revenue and market penetration. AIoT can also make ways for personalized marketing and segmented targeting for more campaign effectiveness.
Industry Influence
AIoT has affected every industry it touched. From manufacturing to healthcare, there is hardly any sector that is yet to experience the awesomeness of AIoT. So, let’s quickly dive into the impact of AIoT across industries to get a better idea.
Manufacturing
In manufacturing, the onset of industrial automation, robotic arms, deep learning algorithms, and more has not only optimized efficiencies but paved the way for reduced operational expenses as well.
Smart Cities and Homes
Smart cities and homes ensure advanced safety for civilians and homeowners with their airtight security systems. Besides, they also help in the responsible consumption of non-renewable resources, curbing pollution, and more.
eCommerce
AIoT in eCommerce helps businesses in advanced product positioning, relationship optimization with vendors, automation of invoicing and billing, generating real-time insights on package deliveries and shipments, and more.
Airlines
With the help of sensors and telematics, airlines are being made safer and trackable with AIoT. The data generated from flight routes are also studied for diverse purposes, including fuel consumption, weather, and more. Besides, AIoT also helps in seamless check-in and airport procedures.
Logistics and Operations
Supply-chains are optimized, and inventory management is simplified with AIoT. Sensors and devices can detect when an item would go out of stock and autonomously replenish the product. AIoT also affects commercial fleets and delivery modules for safety and seamless operations.
Body Sensors
Body sensors can accurately predict when a person is most likely to have a cardiac arrest and notify doctors autonomously. There have been real-world instances of smartwatches saving people as well. In industries, body sensors can be used to prevent calamities and for better tackling of industrial hazards.
Healthcare
Mobile healthcare, electronic health records, remote healthcare consultation, drug research, researches in oncology and genetics are some of the aspects AIoT is working on. From making clinical trials more airtight to helping doctors detect even minute physical changes in skin and organs, AI applications make even the unthinkable possible.
Automobiles
The automotive sector experiences tons of benefits because of AIoT with the implementation of concepts like telematics, human-machine interface systems, in-vehicle infotainment devices, electric vehicles and autonomous vehicle controls, adaptive cruising, and more.
Voice Assistants
Voice assistants detect keywords and help users get advanced or super-precise results for their queries. They also consistently learn about user preferences, tastes, interests, online behavior and recommend personalized content accordingly.
Edge Computing
In edge computing, AIoT offers benefits like reducing latency, increasing network availability, reducing costs involved in storage and data communication, bringing in real-time decision-making systems, and more.
Face Detection
Apart from letting users unlock their phones, IoT applications are helping in finding missing persons and children, preventing retail store crimes, bringing in safety measures in schools, detecting frauds in casinos, finding missing pets and animals and more.
Real-World AIoT Applications
ET City Brain
As we mentioned, AIoT can make cities smarter and roads safer. One such real-world example of this concept in action is ET City Brain. Developed and launched by the Alibaba group, this platform uses artificial intelligence and IoT technology to monitor traffic and road usage, detect accidents, track illegal parking, and pave the way for ambulances by modifying traffic signals and more. The concept also has a proven record of reducing traffic in China by 15%.
Tesla’s Autonomous Cars
What had been a concept only in books and movies has become a reality with the help of AIoT. An autonomous car is a hub of sensors, imaging devices, gadgets, cloud architecture, and data processing modules. All these work together to allow the cars of Tesla to drive autonomously without the need of a driver.
The car collects data from diverse aspects such as road and weather conditions, incoming traffic, pedestrian details, cornering vehicles, speed, fuel consumption, and more and makes accurate driving decisions (every second) for seamless journeys.
Amazon Smart Retail
Amazon Go, a concept store launched by Amazon, is nothing less than revolutionary. It allows users to walk into the store, pick up an item from an aisle and leave. The stores are devoid of cashiers because the IoT devices in action deduct money from users’ virtual wallets. When an item is picked, it’s immediately added to their carts, and when it is kept back, it gets deleted again. When users leave, the system quickly works on the cart orders and processes payment accordingly.
IoT cannot be as effective and powerful as it is now without AI. Together, these two concepts are bringing a new era of experiences and realities to our consciousness. The convergence of AI and IoT only marks the beginning of advanced concepts to come in the near future. What do you think we will get to witness?

Time loss due to traffic jams, rising levels of environmental pollution, an increasing number of fatalities, some of the many woes of urban commuting. Enter smart mobility, a solution based on the use of different modes of transportation instead of one’s personal vehicle. This concept, which runs on the use of carpooling, ridesharing, and bike commuting, has taken cities by storm. Not only that, this market is expected to grow further still though things have been going a little downhill since the advent of the pandemic.
Impact of COVID-19 on the Smart Mobility Market: An Analysis
2020 has been a grim year for all industrial sectors, especially the smart mobility market. The primary reason for the downfall of the smart mobility market can be attributed to a decline in demand for carpooling and ridesharing services across the world, owing to safety concerns.
While it is true that the market is expected to experience even slower growth during 2021, industry experts expect to see the curve rising from the year 2022 onwards. This forecast is based on the belief that adequate safety measures will be introduced for carpooling and ridesharing, such as the placement of plastic barriers between the car’s driver and its passengers.
Factors Affecting the Growth of Smart Mobility
The application of electricity to transportation and the use of carpooling are not novel concepts. In fact, the first Electric Vehicle (EV) was introduced in the US as early as 1889, and by the early 1900s, nearly one-third of the vehicles on the American streets were electricity-powered. It was not until the 1930s that cheap Texas oil made EVs a thing of the past. However, here we stand at the cusp of another golden age wherein EVs and smart mobility are bound to become an essential part of the future.
Having said that, it is natural for one to ask about the significant factors influencing the smart mobility market. The factors may either be drivers or barriers that need to be dealt with the innovation and a common purpose to turn the idea of smart mobility into a living reality.
#1 The Way People Viewed Vehicles are Changing
It was only a few decades back that owning a private car was every family’s dream. Mass production of automobiles and budget-friendly fuel prices brought this ideal within the reach of the average citizen, and as a result, vehicle-centric urban design and personal, door-to-door transportation became the norm.
Today, the scenario is much different. The present millennial-led era prefers not to own a car; instead, this young generation of commuters is shifting in favor of ridesharing services such as Uber or Lyft – they prefer to subscribe to a car-sharing service rather than bear the cost of a personal car, which includes fuel and maintenance costs. Is it any surprise that such new vehicle usage patterns will encourage the growth of the smart mobility market?
#2 Technology is Advancing at a Lightning-Fast Pace
From autonomous vehicles that are smart enough to run on their own to smart parking systems that make the tedious task of parking a piece of cake, technology is the key driver of the smart mobility market. The hyper-connectivity offered by the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G will make it easier for cities to manage traffic, cut down environmental pollution, and make better use of infrastructure. Commuters can have real-time information for smoother and safer transit.
Then, with the use of self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles and drone deliveries, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) predicts that the world may see a whopping 90% reduction in traffic deaths, a 40% reduction in travel time, and a 500% increase in lane capacity. Does it get any smarter than this!
#3 Low Rate of Internet Penetration in Developing Regions
Here’s a barrier to entry for smart mobility systems in full force. Now, the use of ridesharing services requires the involvement of three parties, namely the rider, the driver, and the service provider. The entire process of matching riders with drivers, fare estimation and ride payment are to be carried out via smartphone apps, which in turn require good internet connectivity. 
Unfortunately, some regions, such as Burundi, Chad, and Somalia, among others, have extremely low internet penetration that hinders the development of smart mobility systems in such countries. Once the proper infrastructure for connectivity has been established, the dream of smart mobility can proceed onwards.
#4 An Entirely New Infrastructure and Value Chain is Needed
As much as IoT requires proper infrastructure for connectivity, so does the use of Electric Vehicles require ubiquitous charging infrastructure. The current scenario is pretty awkward wherein potential EV drivers do not see an infrastructure that allows them to buy an EV and drive with confidence, and on the other hand, potential infrastructure providers do not see mass demand insight. Until the time charging stations become as common as gas stations are today, this one barrier-to-entry will make the adoption of EVs a far-fetched dream.
#5 Another Major Driver is Government Policies
Central, state, and city governments can join hands to speed up the adoption of smart mobility systems. Although several US state governments have already directed their focus towards measures such as tax credits and rebates to make smart mobility more affordable for early adopters and are also imposing strict vehicle emission standards for automobile manufacturers, the need of the hour is to offer exclusive EV parking in congested areas, and establishment of ZEZs or Zero Emission Zones wherein traffic will be restricted to bikes, pedestrians, delivery vehicles, and electric vehicles – measures already in place by the city governments of London, Brussels, Paris, and Madrid. Such government policies are sure to accelerate the growth of the smart mobility market.
Top Companies Expected to Dominate the Smart Mobility Market
To create technologically evolved smart mobility solutions, companies need to come up with products that are developed from a long-term market perspective as opposed to short-term creations. This is because as the smart mobility market is set in stone and matures, consumers will naturally demand integrated solutions – a mix of travel services with ancillary services.
As of now, the following companies are expected to take the lead in the future smart mobility market –
CiscoMaaS Global OySiemensTomTom InternationalInnoviz Technologies Inc.Toyota Motor CorporationFord Motor Company, among others.
Despite its present sluggish growth, smart mobility will be a factor in customer preference, changing the way people travel. It’s only a matter of time before this service model comes to the mainstream, and come it will, reaching its projected growth of $70.46 billion by the year 2027.

A lot of cyberattacks originate on network perimeters and are being carried out by software programs that look for easy targets.
Transportation companies are more susceptible than ever to cyberattacks after a tumultuous year shifted the attention of employees in many different directions. People who have the primary responsibility of keeping companies safe are seeing a difficult road ahead.
Cybersecurity is a problem that will never go away, and in response, some transportation companies have given a person, or a department, the duties of chief information security officer (CISO) to enforce IT policies for connectivity among employees, customers and vendors.
With or without a CISO role, all companies have similar needs for tightening their defenses. Barry Lance, network administrator for AIM Transportation Solutions, compares his defense strategy to the rings of an onion. It will take a layered approach to have any chance for success.
Thwarting phishing attempts
The outermost ring should focus on the types of threats that can most easily infiltrate a computer network, said Lance. These include drive-by downloaders and phishing, a type of malware that uses email as a vehicle to get users to click on links and enter login credentials, among other information.
Most phishing attempts can be thwarted by training employees to recognize suspicious emails, he said. Girard, Ohio-based AIM (CCJ Top 250, No. 152) operates a full-service equipment leasing business with more than 12,000 power units and dedicated fleets for shipper customers.
Polaris Transport, a less-than-truckload carrier based in Toronto with more than 120 trucks, uses preventive measures to block phishing email attempts. The company’s email system is configured to automatically quarantine the most suspicious emails. Less suspicious emails are identified with a header, including emails that come from external servers, like Hotmail, that do not have a prerequisite transport layer security (TLS).
“Our people pick it up,” said Dave Brajkovich, chief information officer. If tagged emails are legitimate, employees will notify the senders about the potential vulnerabilities of their email system. 
Securing the perimeter
The second layer of Lance’s onion is focused on preventing outer-layer threats that occur on the perimeter of a network, such as port scanning on firewalls. This is a more difficult area to identify attacks, since a lot of the activity that takes place on the perimeter today is being done automatically by software programs looking for easy targets.
Small and medium-sized fleets have a more difficult time affording the advanced systems they need to monitor network traffic and detect possible intrusions.Lance said he uses software programs that monitor port utilization on network switches to look for traffic anomalies, particularly those that occur after normal business hours. His methodology pays special attention to messages that are moving in or out of AIM’s email domain to prevent attacks from reaching workstations and servers further downstream.
“The trick for me right now is to create a mechanism to provide real-time alerting of these violations out to IT staff without creating alert fatigue for them,” he said.
The last line of defense is to protect workstations and servers. Here, at the center of the onion, Lance said his focus is preventing specific types of threats by setting group policies for user access, and by monitoring for account lockouts, password changes, and security group membership changes.
To thwart more advanced types of cyberattacks on the network perimeter, Polaris is using a monitoring tool from Splunk that identifies possible infiltration attempts. Even the most advanced systems cannot predict when or where an attack will be made.
“Proactiveness is something that doesn’t really exist when it comes to security,” said Ted de Vos, president of Simnet, based in the Toronto area, which provides managed IT services for Polaris Transport. “You can’t proactively monitor but you can reactively monitor everything.”
The Splunk system monitors for different signs that trigger an event to manage. Examples of trigger events include a change in web traffic on a certain port that are combined with data transfers and a failed login. “Together that is an event, and it is what Splunk gives us,” de Vos said.
Insights from Splunk are used to build risk analysis models based on different types of events that can occur. Simnet is using about 20 models to monitor for events at Polaris.
Halvor Lines, a dry van and flatbed carrier based in Superior, Wis. (CCJ Top 250, No. 168), also uses a system that monitors network switches, routers and ports to spot suspicious trends, said Brett Corlett, systems engineer.
Small and medium-sized fleets have a difficult time affording more advanced systems to monitor network traffic, he said, which continue to become more necessary to spot and thwart cyberattacks.
The level of sophistication for cyberattacks is increasing. Many attacks are being done today with automated programs that use artificial intelligence to quickly find vulnerabilities and breach computer networks.
“It’s scary and keeps me up at night,” Corlett added, “and it’s never going to end.”

Wise Systems developed an automated route planning and execution system for last-mile fleets to optimize the delivery experience for their customers.
Investments in the last-mile transportation and logistics sector have been soaring for companies that are not directly competing with the delivery models of UPS, FedEx and the United States Postal Service.
One of the hottest commodities in the last-mile sector has been the same-day delivery of food, beverage and grocery items. Since 2011, funding for crowdsourced delivery platforms such as Instacart and Uber Eats reached $14 billion, according to Deloitte research.
Other fast growing segments include big and bulky freight deliveries and items with extra-sensitive service requirements like medical samples and supplies.
No matter the freight type, delivery expectations in the last-mile sector are driven by Amazon, which currently fulfills 72% of orders for Prime customers within 24 hours.
The defining moment in Amazon’s last-mile strategy was its 2018 launch of the Delivery Service Partner (DSP) program. Since then, Amazon has been contracting with local delivery companies to compete directly with UPS and FedEx on a massive scale. Today the DSP program counts more than 1,300 delivery firms and 20,000 delivery vans in its ranks worldwide.
One of the benefits for fleets that are Amazon DSPs is having access to sophisticated delivery technology, but the downside is the ease with which the world’s largest online retailer cuts contracts. This has forced many local delivery fleets to search for new opportunities.
Down to the last footWith the amount of investment dollars and capacity flowing into the last mile segment, some technology companies have found opportunities to give fleets a competitive edge by solving complex routing problems.
Generally, fleets have a majority of their deliveries planned in advance for the next day but need to dynamically add stops to these routes for 30% to 40% of orders that come in during the day with same-day delivery expectations.
Solving complex routing problems has positioned some companies to offer fleets an automated dispatch process, which will be even more valuable when autonomous vehicles arrive on the scene.
In 2014, the prospects for using autonomous vehicles for last-mile delivery were bright, and the founders of Wise Systems saw a market opportunity to develop autonomous dispatch, route planning and execution software for last-mile delivery companies.
Wise Systems is not a technology company like Instacart or Uber Eats that is trying to operate in the logistics space. Rather, it offers its technology to fleets. Although the arrival of autonomous delivery vehicles did not happen as originally planned, fleets are using the software to optimize route planning and execution down to the final feet of deliveries, said Ali Kamil, chief technology officer and co-founder of Wise Systems.
The cloud-based software captures time, location and other route data every few seconds from an app that runs on mobile devices. The software knows when drivers arrive, when they get to a customer’s door and when they depart.
With this granular level of data capture — which includes the number and weight of delivery units — the software predicts how long it will take to complete future deliveries at each customer location. It also learns from repeat visits to determine the best way to enter, the best spot to park and the best time to visit to expedite the delivery process.
“Collecting all of this data enables us to learn,” Kamil said, “so we can plan better tomorrow.”
The mobile driver app is easy to use and helps drivers make more money by completing more deliveries each day. “Drivers don’t want to be spending time monkeying around,” he noted. “It needs to be quick and easy.”
Fleets that use the software can dynamically add stops into a route optimization engine and give their customers access to a web portal for tracking the status of deliveries. The end customer can also sign up to receive text or email notifications.
The end customer can get real-time expected time of arrival with accuracy down to five minutes, he said. With this level of visibility, “what we are enabling for customers is a better and faster delivery experience than Amazon,” he said. “We are not just going accept that Amazon is going to dominate.”

 Expected Biden administration infrastructure initiatives, combined with favorable autonomous vehicle (AV) regulatory and testing environments in the U.S. are expected to spur AV deployments 
 By Pär-Olof Johannesson 
Over the past decade, the United States of America has paved the way for an autonomous driving future. In addition to steps already taken by industry, academic and the U.S. Department of Transportation, President-elect Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan bodes well for the autonomous vehicle industry.
Crucial YearsThe next four years under the Biden administration could prove crucial to the nation’s ability to lead the autonomous driving race, but also increase road safety throughout the country. The two issues are not unrelated.
As America works to “build back better,” road safety needs to be taken into account. Road traffic injuries have been the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5-29 years and the eighth leading cause of deaths globally. Given that 95% of all road accidents are due to human error, prioritizing advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) vehicles can get the country to a safer place. Furthermore, while COVID-19 has crippled other markets, the pandemic has served to tighten the focus on the importance of self-driving cars, with many viewing driverless deliveries as a safer alternative, allowing robotaxi companies such as AutoX to secure a renewed wave of support.
U.S. Uniquely PositionedThe U.S. is uniquely positioned to succeed in the ADAS testing space. Its infrastructure makes it ideal for holding trial runs for self-driving vehicles. Compared with Europe’s tight infrastructure, North America’s wide and sweeping highways are optimal for testing large-scale driverless vehicles.
Though both regions still must update existing infrastructure to incorporate AV specific enhancements, such as staging areas, charging stations and inspection locations, North America simply has more space than Europe. In addition, the U.S. also has options for large-scale testing facilities like the University of Michigan’s Mcity. 
Biden and an Autonomous FutureBiden has signaled that his administration will prioritize infrastructure, which could prove favorable to the AV industry. His plan also emphasizes the importance of EVs, and the U.S.’s deployment of fuel-efficient cars and trucks can only help the ADAS space, as most autonomous vehicles will be electrically powered.
Similarly, poor road maintenance is one of the most consistent challenges driverless cars face. Biden’s focus on road repair, in addition to promising developments in self-repairing smart concrete, could allow for a smoother transition to autonomous driving.
Favorable Regulatory EnvironmentEven without the pending Biden administration, the transportation regulatory environment in the U.S. is decidedly more favorable than Europe’s to the transportation industry, and this has consequences. For example, carmaker Audi has expressed its frustrations with European ADAS testing regulations, especially in comparison with their U.S. counterparts. It should be noted, however, that as of mid 2022, all new cars put on the EU market are required to be equipped with ADAS features, setting the continent up for faster large-scale deployment than the U.S.
With less red tape around securing appropriate permits, it is far easier to set up testing sites on American soil. Long gone are the days where California served as the country’s lone test site. A number of states are jumping on the testing bandwagon ranging from the SunTrax Testing Facility in Florida to a rollout of potential Walmart delivery trucks in Arizona.

As of this year, 45 out of 50 U.S. states have taken it upon themselves to enact AV-related legislation.

Standards, TooFurther, the Department of Transportation (DOT) has already shown willingness to establish self-driving standards. Just earlier this month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began soliciting public comments to standardize safety protocols for driverless vehicles. So while this initiative began under President Donald Trump, federal guidelines will certainly come to fruition under Biden.
States Leading the AV chargeRegardless of who is in the Oval Office, individual states have been making significant strides in autonomous driving on their own. Between Silicon Valley and Waymo’s rollout in California to Boston Dynamics shaking up the tech scene in Massachusetts, autonomous systems have made headway from coast to coast.
As of this year, 45 out of 50 U.S. states have taken it upon themselves to enact AV-related legislation. Even Nevada has gotten in on the action with Motional’s pending rollout. It is clear that the states have prioritized autonomous driving and will continue to do so, regardless of federal guidance.
China – Opportunities and ChallengesIt comes as no surprise that the Chinese market could provide American ADAS makers with a wealth of consumers. But it is important to not let trade conflicts with China impede future success.
The size of China’s market alone is enough to convince any business to target its consumers, but it also helps that they are more open to driverless vehicles, according to a recent study from Deloitte.
As of 2020, only 35% of Chinese respondents stated that they do not think self-driving cars are safe, in comparison with 48% of Americans. Similarly, U.S. residents have been slower to change their attitudes as a whole, with the percentage consistently wavering between 47% and 50% in the past three years, unlike countries such as Japan, which have seen more significant changes in perception.
China’s focus on 5G wireless network infrastructure and smart cities may allow for vehicles with ADAS to hit the roads en masse far ahead of the U.S. timeline. Not only would this potentially position China for a faster rollout, but it would also have an edge when it comes to statewide integration. While the U.S. lags in 5G infrastructure, China’s 5G focus may ultimately enable autonomous vehicles to take the road using a 5G transportation grid with a more standardized approach.
In terms of China’s access to the U.S., even Chinese companies have taken notice of the U.S.’s unparalleled access to potential test sites. Some Chinese automakers that do not produce or sell cars in the U.S. have licenses to test self-driving cars in California. In short, both the U.S. and China would lose valuable investment opportunities should ongoing trade conflicts persist. But with China continuing to thrive in the industry, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more crucial than ever that the U.S. has access to this market.

At the end of the day, over 1.35 million people around the world lose their lives each year to driving related accidents.

StandardizatonWith this in mind, one of the most important aspects of an autonomous future is standardization. Of course, that applies to a standardization of regulations across the U.S. and the world. But more importantly, it also applies to a standardization of the technology used in these vehicles across North America, Europe, and Asia. At the end of the day, over 1.35 million people around the world lose their lives each year to driving related accidents. If we want to ensure a faster road to autonomous driving and a truly safer future, we need to take industrial and scientific collaboration on standardized regulations and technologies seriously.

It is hard to believe that cars really haven’t been a part of human existence all that long. The first one hit the road in the late 1800s. The idea of every family having a vehicle as an essential component of their lives didn’t really become a reality until after World War II.
Early vehicles would be hardly recognizable today; all lacked safety features we take for granted and most were very bare-bones machines.
Fast forward to today and car technology is advancing so quickly it can be hard to keep up. Safety features such as airbags and seatbelts are standard, but new features such as forward collision warning and auto braking are becoming mainstream. Likewise, numerous sensors, bells, and whistles help us keep our machines running smoothly and cushions or heated seats help us ride in comfort on any journey.
Perhaps the most exciting aspect of new cars today is the technology. Tech is pushing the boundaries of what we expect in our vehicles from a safety standpoint as well as from an entertainment one. The advancements on the horizon are things that were unthinkable in the past and, in some ways, things we hardly dare to believe now. 
A Smart Car
These days, the technologies that come in our vehicles are not only important selling points, but they are downright clever advances.
One of the big things many people have come to expect in their vehicles is connectivity. A connection to the internet and connections to smartphones are hot-button advancements in most newer models. These smartphone connections allow for all sorts of things, from playing music wirelessly to tracking your teenager’s whereabouts through an app.
Other smart technologies that are becoming mainstream features in our cars are those that have to deal with safety. Many manufacturers now offer some form of advanced driver-assist systems in their vehicles. This can mean a lot of things, but the gist is that driver assist offers features that take some of the effort out of driving and, in theory, enhance safety. Advanced driver-assist systems can include things like:
Lane departure warnings.Adaptive cruise control.Automatic emergency braking.Blindspot alerts.Assisted parking.Reverse braking assistance.Exit warning systems.
So far, drivers are having mixed reactions to the advanced driver-assist functions. Some people are eager to do less in their vehicles, while others would rather maintain control and not have to worry about a car feature kicking in while they are doing something slightly technical like parallel parking.
AAA has also found mixed results in actual safety benefits, warning that the technologies are still in the early stages of development and becoming too dependent upon them can lead to problems.
Self-Driving Coming Soon?
Arguably the biggest advancement that many people are looking forward to is the introduction of the self-driving car. Hype for these cars appears to have its ebbs and flows, but many think the technology is on the verge of becoming a reality. It could be something that many of us start seeing in the next couple of decades and our grandchildren may never even know what it is like to actually drive a car.
There are certainly pros and cons to the technologies that come with self-driving vehicles. Many advocates argue that self-driving vehicles have the potential to greatly reduce driving accidents and deaths. They say the tech has the potential to take out the human error factor, which can cause over 90% of serious accidents. 
Advocates also point to a number of other benefits including things like accessibility and environmental impacts. Self-driving cars mean that anyone can jump in a vehicle and go somewhere; they eliminate boundaries for those that are unable to drive. Additionally, advocates point to data suggesting that self-driving vehicles could reduce traffic jams and increase fuel efficiencies, which would be a benefit from an environmental standpoint.
Cybersecurity Concerns
Many of these technological advancements offer a great means of increasing safety and making car travel even more convenient and enjoyable. However, there are some inherent risks associated with the tech. For one, extensive technology in vehicles opens the door for cybersecurity concerns.
Connective technologies that are essential for things like self-driving vehicles mean that your car is connected to a much larger grid. Much like connecting your computer to the internet, a gridded car connection exposes vehicles to the potential for hacking. It’s hard to say what could happen, but hackers that are able to gain access to a vehicle could have control over acceleration, braking, radio, and other technologies.
Fortunately, this is a risk that many experts are aware of and are actively trying to combat. Many companies are developing software that will allow them to identify when a hack is occurring and combat it rapidly across the country. Some experts think there may need to be features that allow vehicles to be transferred back to owner control in these instances.
Advancements in vehicle tech are happening faster than many of us are able to keep up with. New entertainment and safety tech such as advanced driver-assist systems are considered precursors to self-driving cars. Though these new technologies are exciting, there are still a number of risks, including cybersecurity vulnerabilities, that need to be worked out before they are really ready to hit the road.

IoT technology development gave a start to several interdisciplinary fields that combine IoT with other technologies and studies. One of the most well-known examples of such fields is telematics, a mix of telecommunications, IoT, electrical engineering, and the automotive industry.
While telematics can be applied to education and healthcare, one of its biggest use cases is vehicle telematics. It encompasses vehicle tracking, fleet management, and vehicle maintenance and brings undeniable advantages to the car-sharing industry.
Challenges of Carsharing
To fully comprehend vehicle telematics’ benefits, it is important to understand the actual challenges that the carsharing industry faces.
Carsharing is a car rental model where users rent a car for a short period of time. That means there is always a high user turnover and a very high unpredictability in car maintenance. Since a single car can be used by dozens of people with different driving styles, there is always a chance that some people will be speeding, will be inaccurate while driving, or will leave the engine idling.While telematics allows for easy vehicle monitoring and more accurate routing, it also brings specific benefits to the car-sharing industry by making the driving process safer and allowing better car maintenance.Click To Tweet
If we define the main challenges of the carsharing industry in terms of fleet management, they will be:
Car maintenance: are the drivers managing cars properly?The cost of idling: do cars spend too much time idling?Harsh braking and driving: are drivers speeding or driving inaccurately?Vehicle Location: where are the vehicles at the moment?
All these questions need to be answered to save money for a carsharing company. This is where telematics comes in place and helps resolve these issues.
Telematics: Overview and Benefits
As said above, telematics is a mix of telecommunications and informatics. It can be considered a subset of IoT since it deploys integrated sensors to obtain certain data.
A telematics device for vehicles is called a black box and contains the following components: a GPS receiver, accelerometer, engine interface, a SIM card, a buzzer, and the expander port. This black box captures the data that a vehicle generates (such as car position, speed, fuel consumption, tire pressure, etc.) and sends it to the cloud. In the cloud, the data is processed and analyzed further to the user’s choice application.
Summing up, the black box device provides you with detailed information on the car’s status and its current position–so how can you use this data to your advantage?
Improved Car Maintenance
Battery voltage, tire pressure, brake state – all these and other indicators can be monitored with telematics. Hence, if there is anything wrong with the car or the need for maintenance arises, car owners can react promptly and provide better car maintenance which, in turn, leads to a longer use period of a car.
Improved Operating Cost Management
With carsharing, fuel is usually included in the price, which means a user does not have to pay for it additionally. Hence, the issue of saving costs on fuel is quite acute for the owners of carsharing businesses.
Telematics allows to monitor several factors that affect fuel consumption:
IdlingDriving manner (aggressive driving increases fuel consumption)Weather (low temperatures promote higher fuel consumption)Use of accessories (air conditioning, etc.)
By knowing about such things, car owners can adjust their policy to reduce fuel consumption and cut down fuel costs.
Improved Driver Safety
Telematics offers multiple options for making the driving process safer for drivers. First, you can set up the device to notify the driver if there is a need for maintenance or to slow down (if the driver is speeding). This will naturally lead to a reduced number of dangerous situations.
Second, telematics enables carsharing companies to quickly and easily locate a vehicle. This option can be quite valuable when there is a need to locate a stolen vehicle or a vehicle in an emergency.
Telematics and Fleet Management
Today, there are many providers of telematics-based solutions that fleet owners successfully use. These solutions usually come in the form of a web and/or mobile application and have an admin and a user interface.
Using the data generated by the vehicle black box, the application displays advanced reporting and analytics, allowing easy management of every car in the fleet. Simultaneously, such applications allow users to see a car’s status before booking it and provide easy registration and payment processes. Advanced features may include limited access to vehicles (for authorized drivers only), emergency buttons for dangerous situations, and driver training while being on the road.
Telematics in carsharing provides one significant benefit: it allows the automatic collection of nearly impossible data to be collected manually. This data can further help car-sharing companies make better business decisions by knowing the real-time state of every car in the fleet. As for the drivers, telematics greatly contributes to their safety by monitoring their driving style and providing helpful suggestions during the ride. Hence, it’s safe to assume that telematics is here to stay and expand its presence as the digitization of the automotive industry continues to grow.

 Honolulu can increase the efficiency of its roads in all kinds of ways. 
By Sumner La Croix, Justin Tyndall

The COVID-19 pandemic imposed enormous costs on Honolulu’s population. Many businesses and schools closed their doors, the tourism industry ground to a halt, unemployment rose to record levels and … traffic declined to levels never before seen by even the longest-lived Honolulu resident.
Many marveled at how easy it was to get around the city. Of course, the light traffic was a by-product of lockdowns and mobility restrictions, but it did raise an important question: Was it really necessary to go back to the jam-packed roads of 2019?
Perhaps there were sensible ways to keep traffic at lower levels? If there were, state and city policymakers and bureaucrats seemed too preoccupied to think about them.
And now: The traffic is slowly returning. That’s because people have decided to venture out more to restaurants, gyms, social gatherings and workplaces. The good news is that traffic is still about 20% below 2019 heights.
Traffic returning is generally a good sign, reflecting more people being vaccinated and residents deciding they can engage in more activities in person.
But there is no reason for traffic to return to pre-pandemic levels. Voluntary actions, simple government programs and direct government intervention all have a role to play.

This graph, created from data collected across the entire state of Hawaii, shows the dramatic decrease in traffic brought on by the pandemic — as well as the gradual increase we are all now witnessing. During normal times, residents pay a huge price for congestion. A recent report on traffic in Hawaii estimated the cost of congestion in the state to be $690 million annually. This cost is mainly paid through lost time and productivity from workers sitting in gridlock. Smarter policy could eliminate this cost and direct the savings to local workers.
At low levels of use, most major roads can handle additional cars without traffic slowing appreciably. But at some level of traffic, just a few additional cars can slow traffic dramatically, which imposes costly delays on other drivers. The result in Hawaii is bumper-to-bumper, slow-moving traffic during rush hours on the H-1 and H-2 highways and other major arteries.
Policies that keep those last few cars off the road during rush hour can generate big social benefits. Fortunately, policymakers have an abundance of options to accomplish this, policies that have already been tested and proven in other cities.
Rush Hour Tolls And Other Ideas
The most direct and efficient way to limit traffic would be to levy an electronically monitored toll on congested roads during rush hour. Properly calibrated tolls could make intense rush hour congestion a relic of the past. To allay concerns that tolls would amount to a new tax, revenue could be rebated directly to local residents and even directed preferentially to lower-income households to allay any concerns that tolls would be regressive.
Looking beyond tolls, policymakers face a menu of measures that could improve traffic. Investments in TheBus or cycling infrastructure would help to get some people out of their cars. Rideshare programs are already in place and have potential to be more broadly applied. Giving incentives to local businesses to allow staggered work hours or more remote work would reduce the demand for rush hour commuting.
Despite the large potential gains from these measures, state and local governments across the United States and in Hawaii have struggled to implement effective policies. For example, workers have resisted schemes to stagger office hours and commuting times due to reasonable concerns that staggered and perhaps unpredictable hours will complicate coordination of drop-off and pick-up times for their schoolchildren.
COVID-19 has shaken up this worldview. By forcing so many people to work from home and change their commuting behavior, the pandemic has changed how employers and employees view the costs and benefits of a central workplace and of gathering workers there for fixed hours, Monday to Friday.
Both employers and employees have realized that some (but not all) workers can be as productive at home as in the office, at least some of the time. This has opened the door for employers to offer some employees the option of working from home one or more days per week. Social gains result from these private bargains, as fewer commuters means less traffic.
The same analysis applies to staggered hours. Moving commuting from traditional rush hours to slightly later in the morning has the potential to decrease rush-hour commuting times without adding much additional inconvenience to people commuting mid-morning.
An alternative is to charge a congestion zone fee to drive within the downtown area or perhaps the downtown-to-Waikiki corridor.
Local and state governments could help residents gain the additional social benefits from traffic control by providing incentives to private firms to stagger hours and/or keep more employees working at home. In fact, governments could take the lead on this by providing additional incentives for their own workforces to continue to work some days at home.
Consider that University of Hawaii campuses might accomplish this by not starting most on-campus classes until 10 a.m. and offering more early morning on-line classes.
Today, work from home arrangements have left Honolulu with less traffic congestion. Whether such arrangements will lead to less traffic congestion in the longer term is unclear and there is some reason to be pessimistic.
This is because of what is known as The Fundamental Law of Traffic Congestion: Once traffic lightens, people who found it too congested to drive to downtown Honolulu or Waikiki or Pearlridge Shopping Center will decide to make the trip. As more drivers take more trips, the roads are likely to once again become highly congested.
How To Move Forward
Is there a way out of this cycle, to reduce traffic to manageable levels permanently? Imposing a toll may be problematic due to federal regulations on tolling federally financed highways such as H-1 and H-2. An alternative is to charge a congestion zone fee to drive within the downtown area or perhaps the downtown-to-Waikiki corridor.
Fees to access congested areas have been widely studied and effectively used in other major cities, with London and Stockholm having perhaps the most effective applications. Administration has been smoothed in both cities by technology that monitors license plates entering the congestion zone.
The central Stockholm area is a group of islands, and this geography facilitates the collection of the congestion zone fee: It is charged, via bridges connecting islands, both when a car enters and leaves. The total daily fee varies by the time of entrance/exit and is capped at 135 krona ($16.20). The fee is not charged on public holidays, the day prior to the holiday or during July when most Stockholm residents are on holiday.
Cars driven within the central London congestion zone (an 8.1-square-mile area) pay a daily charge of £15 ($20.85) from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day but Christmas. Billing is based on technology that recognizes license plate numbers and deducts payment from a bank account; or the congestion charge can be pre-paid via an app or website. Residents living in or near the zone receive a 90% discount on the congestion charge. After the charge was implemented, the volume of traffic fell about 9% within the zone and home values within the zone increased.
A congestion zone fee in central Honolulu has been discussed as a complementary policy when the Honolulu rapid transit project reaches downtown, to encourage commuters and day-trippers to use the train. But a well-designed congestion zone fee, set perhaps at $5 to $10 per day, can yield big benefits prior to the train’s arrival in the 2030s.
If the congestion zone fee was in place only during weekday rush hours, workers and firms would have an incentive to allow for more flexible work hours. Workers would also have increased incentives to carpool or take TheBus. And when rush hour traffic improves, the incentives for other drivers to take more trips during rush hour is reduced because they too must also pay the congestion zone fee.
Perhaps the big lesson that we have learned from the pandemic is that we need to rethink the way that we approach certain activities. State and local government leaders have been heavily criticized because they did not take advantage of the downtime to implement better policies to control the costs imposed on the community by tourism.
While the same could be said for traffic, it’s not too late for us to plan for an island with less traffic. There’s no need to wait for the train for that goal to be realized.

We have advanced systems in place for most chores and daily tasks. However, parking still remains a hassle and time-consuming activity that most people hate. Isn’t it time we move on to a much more convenient parking method that could save time and effort? Data-driven parking is the answer to the parking predicament for the urban areas of the world. A market report by Allied Market Research predicts that the smart parking market will have a valuation of $11.13 billion by 2027. This is why data is the future of parking.
What is Data-Driven Parking?
Imagine having a parking spot ready even before you leave your house. And the cherry on top is you get to pay for it digitally. Well, that is certainly possible with the power of data intelligence.
Data-driven parking makes it possible for you to book a parking spot before you actually reach your destination. This is made possible by real-time data. It tells you where a vacant parking spot is available near your workplace or the shopping mall. How? The data-driven parking technology uses data to keep track of vehicles and different parking spots.
These may include the analysis of vehicles’ movement on the road, connected parking meters, sensors, cameras, and boom-barriers. Hence, it is also known as a smart parking solution. All you have to do is open the application and look for a parking space on your phone and reserve it!
Benefits of Data-driven Parking Facility
Saving 20 minutes every day by pre-booking a parking spot via a smartphone app can save a lot of your time in the longer run. However, there are some other benefits of smart parking as well.
Real-time monitoring: As the name suggests, the Data-driven parking system analyses data to find the vacant parking spots in real-time. It combines the power of cell phones and advanced technologies such as IoT, AI, Machine Learning, and Big Data Analytics to help you find the right spot. Also, it uses a real-time data management system to track and keep a record of vehicles.Digital payment: With data-driven parking, you don’t have to look for cash every time you park your car. Smart parking apps allow you to pay for the parking space digitally through various payment modes.Space optimization: We’ve all seen vacant spots in parking lots. Through a data-driven system, parking facility managers can optimize the use of their space and thus increase revenue.No stress: Looking for a parking spot can become frustrating and stressful. Thus, Data-driven parking is an ideal option, as it removes the stress and uncertainty of finding a parking spot. Knowing that you have a parking spot awaiting you can help you enjoy the drive more.
Bottom Line
Data-driven parking can help you save time, as it eliminates the long process of searching for a parking spot. Hence, no more circling the parking lot looking for an empty space every day.
By using the latest technology and data science, tasks such as car parking can be made simpler. In most urban cities, road traffic is a pressing issue, and the only way to tackle it is to take the smart and data-driven route. Most global cities plan to become smart cities within the next few years. And, Smart parking initiatives will bring the Citizens of such cities closer to Smart living.d

 Jason Morgan is the editor of Fleet Equipment. He has more than 15 years of B2B journalism experience covering the likes of trucking and construction equipment, real estate, movies and craft beer industries 
ByJason Morgan

It’s fun to talk about the buzz of the last mile delivery segment, but you get to a point where you think: What is the actual growth and makeup of the segment, and what does that mean for fleets?
For answers to those questions and a closer look at the booming trucking segment, I connected with Chad Heminover, president of The Shyft Group’s Fleet Vehicles and Services business unit. You may recognize The Shyft Group’s brands, including Utilimaster, Royal Truck Body, DuraMag, and Strobes-R-Us, to name a couple. With the Utilimaster brand, Heminover is on the front lines with last mile delivery operations, helping them make equipment decisions and navigate the increasingly complicated equipment technology evolution as electric vehicles enter the market and last mile demand grows.
Here’s what Heminover had to say.
Fleet Equipment (FE): What growth have you seen in the last mile segment in the past year and half, and how much do you see it growing going forward in the short term?
Heminover: What we’re seeing is that e-commerce is expected to grow 22% through 2022. Then you start looking at: What does that mean in regards to the parcel market and what these last mile delivery companies are going to need from a vehicle perspective?
If you take UPS, FedEx, Amazon, DHL and the likes, we’ve done some market research that tells us that the compound average growth rate from 2021 through 2025 is going to be about 13%. That’s going to give us an opportunity to continue to build more vehicles for that space.
FE: What’s the Shyft Group’s position in the last mile space? What applications do you serve?
Heminover: We have an offering that covers Class 1 through 7 vehicles, and it supports the last mile delivery space. We have three products that we service or rebuild for large parcel delivery customers. We have our step van business, which is the traditional walk-in van that we sell to the country’s largest parcel delivery fleets. Those are the bigger vehicles. We also have a truck body segment within, within the Utilimaster brand that we build truck bodies that also service that last mile delivery segment. Lastly, we have an upfit side of the business where we are upfitting cargo vans that are used in last mile applications as well, for those parcel delivery companies.
FE: What’s the makeup of last mile delivery companies you’ve worked with?
Heminover: There’s a good mix. If you look at this segment, you have companies like UPS that employ professional drivers and own their vehicles; you have FedEx Express that has a fleet of vehicles that are corporate owned. Then you have the other side that’s a delivery service provider model—these are contractors that buy a variety of different types of vehicles that Amazon has spec’d. Finally, you have the FedEx ground contractor segment; they’re not employees of FedEx, they’re contractors.
There are also a lot of new companies entering this space. On the FedEx Ground side, for example, there are a lot of new entrants into the contractor space, and their current contractors need more vehicles as a result of the growth that the market is experiencing.
FE: With such a diverse field of companies and contractors, are there any pieces of standout equipment spec’ing advice?
Heminover: Yeah, we try to spec the truck to the routes. For example, if you’re a FedEx ground contractor, and you’re trying to figure out what vehicle you need, it all depends on your route size. If you have a high frequency of stops in your delivery schedule, the truck body that we would put you in is a cutaway. If your application has less frequent stops or you need a bigger payload, and you need durability, we’d put you in a dry freight truck body.
If you have an urban and rural route, and you want to be able to get in and out of the vehicle efficiently, we would put you into a walk-in van. We have a new product that we just launched in October that’s getting some great market feedback—our Velocity F2 product line, which complements our Velocity M3. The F2 is built on a Ford Transit chassis. The Velocity M3 is built on a Mercedes chassis. These are Class 2 or 3 vehicles that are ideal for urban delivery and serving multiple drivers and different routes.
FE: How do you help customers calculate cost of ownership?
Heminover: That’s what they’re still all trying to learn. Each of these customers has different expectations of the vehicle life cycle, especially in the contractors segment. Larger companies that have been in the market for a long time have their ROI models figured out, but smaller contractors that are mom-and-pop operations are learning the hard way in a lot of cases where the vehicles break down, and they’re putting a lot of money back into them when they should, in some cases, be replacing them.
What we do is help them understand that we provide aftermarket support. We have a field services team that educates them on the pros and cons of each vehicle. We have that close relationship with the customer because what we do very well is, we are the ones that are designing the package that goes into the back of any of the vehicles that we do. All of these customers are looking to the upfitter to come up with packages that meet the needs of their drivers.
FE: There’s a lot of buzz in this segment about electric vehicles. What are you hearing from your customer base in terms of adoption of EVs?
Heminover: My view on the EV space is: EV is coming. There are a lot of companies and organizations that are throwing a lot of money at the electric vehicle space. The economics currently doesn’t make sense if you’re in the buyer’s position, but somebody is going to figure it out. All the big fleet customers are having some type of initiative around electric vehicles and [going] green. But I think they’re probably a couple of years out before smaller fleets actually make a significant investment in electric vehicles, just because of the fact that there’s a significant investment that has to go on the infrastructure to be able to support these vehicles.

The rise of autonomous vehicles will redefine how our cities are built and how we perceive transportation in urban environments. 
By Sophie Zoria 
Automation of routine tasks is currently a concept that interests many industries. Among the most revolutionary parts of it are autonomous vehicles. There are visions of the future of city infrastructure. The main ideas they all share are self-driving cars and shared mobility. Those are set to revolutionize the ways we navigate through cities. 
Such concepts will make our whole cities smart, by fundamentally changing their infrastructure so that it’s adapted to autonomous vehicles. This will provide us with much safer roads. According to the USA National Highway Traffic Administration, 94 percent of serious car crashes are due to human error.
Autonomous driving wouldn’t need people’s decisions, which could often be dangerous and irrational to take you from point A to point B. This means a significant decrease in accidents and thousands of saved lives. 
The tremendous technological progress now gives us the possibility to have a closer look at all the advantages we could have in our cities of the future, together with autonomous driving and the new smart infrastructure. 
It’s expected that thanks to the advanced 5G network, combined with the Internet of Things, the global market revenue of autonomous vehicles will hit $556.67 billion by 2026. All those emerging technologies working together will change the traditional look of our cities, and they’ll become smart as well. 
However, we’re still years away from fully autonomous cars hitting the mass market. So what’s the key to adopting this revolutionary technology, and how do we need to change our cities to make that possible?
The Autonomous Vehicle Infrastructure
We wouldn’t be able to go fully autonomous without the right infrastructure. We can’t just switch to self-driving cars. The shift will also require enhanced manufacturing processes and new kinds of supply chains. Most importantly, the infrastructure must be prepared for it. Once all that’s ready, we’ll start seeing autonomous cars on urban streets.
We’re getting closer to the time when mobility freedom will finally be available to everyone. To measure that, KPMG has made an Automotive Vehicle Readiness Index, which shows how prepared different countries are for autonomous driving. According to their research, the country that’s most prepared for the new infrastructure is the Netherlands. It could serve as a model for other countries to follow to accelerate the global adoption of the technology. 
Right behind, in 2nd and 3rd places, are Singapore and the United States. However, none of those countries has a total score of over 30, which means that even the most prepared countries at the moment still have a long way to go.
A Challenging Project
The automotive industry is rapidly evolving, which makes the need for the new smart autonomous vehicle infrastructure more necessary than ever. Authorities have to consider updates to it and work with developers to make the new wave of urban transformation successful. 
What the Netherlands has, more than the others, are harmonized regulations, standards and excellent roads that will easily undergo renovation. To be ready for self-driving cars, this country would still need some improvements, such as advanced on-road telematics, smart curbs, and lanes. 
Here are changes to be made so that the new smart city infrastructure will be suitable for autonomous vehicles:
Lane Marking
Poor road markings are challenging even for the already existing connected vehicles. It’s something that has to be worked on for the effective adoption of AVs. The road markings should not only be reflective but machine-readable. 
Roadside Sensors
To be prepared for the driverless future, roadside sensors should be included on sidewalks, curbs and lanes. They will allow vehicles to keep track of their surroundings and foresee potentially dangerous situations.
Smart Signage
Current autonomous vehicles use image recognition for reading road signs. However, a much more reliable approach would be machine-readable signs. They will include an embedded code that could be transmitted. They’ll send messages detectable by computers. 
Changing the Way Cities Look
Cities of the future will be transformed into actual digital hubs. We know technology today is mostly human-centered, which means that cities will become better places to live. The adoption of connected autonomous vehicles will increase road capacity and reduce congestion, even in the most densely populated areas. 
It’s expected that the driverless future will fundamentally change the look of cities’ infrastructure. For instance, traffic lights might no longer be needed, as they were originally designed for humans. Instead, machines could determine driving priority themselves and actually be more efficient. Autonomous cars are also connected and they could form fleets that travel in the same direction and share all the information on their surroundings.
Smart roads that include the right signage, sensors and lining will be extremely useful for vehicles, making passengers experience safer than ever. 
Following our previous example of the Netherlands as the most AV-ready country in the world, we can see that the changes that they’ve made to their infrastructure already result in safety, as the number of road deaths decreases every year. 
No More Parking Facilities
Looking for a parking spot can be quite stressful. Fortunately, with the revolution of autonomous vehicles, cities won’t need any type of parking anymore. Garages will move outside of downtown areas, thanks to the predicted trend of shared mobility. 
Furthermore, self-driving cars are able to use narrower driving lanes and maneuver better than existing cars, so parking spaces will be optimized to accommodate more cars. All the space that is currently used for parking could find new uses in smart cities. 
Connectivity Is Key
From a single traffic cone to the overall autonomous driving infrastructure – it’s all about connectivity. Have you noticed that no one mentions fuel when talking about autonomous vehicles? Well, that’s because gasoline wouldn’t matter as much as connectivity would.
Autonomous vehicles will bring tons of sensors and IoT devices to modern cities. The advanced 5G network will allow them to constantly receive and transmit huge amounts of data. Moreover, the steering wheel will be replaced by whatever the driver desires, which will produce more load on the network.
The Impact of 5G
5G might be the missing piece of the puzzle to make efficient autonomous vehicles. The network claims to be a hundred times faster than the current 4G. It’s expected that it would serve 40 percent of the world by 2024.
5G wireless technology would require extensive infrastructure. New fiber-optic cables will have to be placed throughout this new autonomous vehicle infrastructure. This will be helpful for future infrastructure changes for self-driving cars. The promise of this next-generation network to bring safer driverless cars could lead to a revolutionary development of smart cities. 
A New Life for Cities
Automotive vehicles won’t just change the way we travel, they will generally change the look of current infrastructure, not only in cities but on highways as well. The AV revolution might bring us to a future of smooth and predictable traffic and more efficient public transportation. 
City residents will have more free space to make use of. Moreover, there will be fewer risks for pedestrians and bicyclists as they have many concerns about urban areas. All of the benefits that autonomous vehicles together with smart cities could bring will improve millions of people’s quality of life while taking next-level care for the environment.

Emphasis on emissions reduction is even more important today, especially as the demand for manufacturing and the movement of goods has exploded. Find out how hundreds of companies are working towards ‘net zero’ carbon strategies. 
By John Flynn
A renewed movement and focus on emissions reduction is gaining significant traction throughout corporate America. Hundreds of companies today have plans to significantly cut back on their greenhouse-gas emissions to “net-zero” through several carbon-reduction technologies.
Nearly 1,400 companies have promised to cut their net carbon dioxide emissions to zero over the coming decades. So-called carbon offsets, where the gas is removed from the atmosphere, are central to many of these plans.
This emphasis on emissions reduction is even more important today, especially as the demand for manufacturing and the movement of goods has exploded because of online shopping. Parcel carriers around the world continue to report record profits with expectations this trend will last into 2021.
The promise of sustainable transportation
Reinforcing this, 2021 has started out with different priorities from President Biden, who has made clean and sustainable infrastructure one of his primary agenda items for his new administration in the White House.
During his presidential campaign, President-elect Biden discussed a $2 trillion plan to build a “modern, sustainable infrastructure and an equitable clean energy future.” These remarks were echoed in a recent article in Logistics Management.
“Americans deserve infrastructure they can trust: Infrastructure that is resilient to floods, fires, and other climate threats, not fragile in the face of these increasing risks,” the plan says.
Sustainable infrastructure that thrives through carbon reduction today is taking place in all forms. For private and for-hire transportation fleets this includes new Class 8 trucks equipped with clean diesel technology that help move retail goods, food and medicine across the country.
Clean transportation initiatives
Organizations continue to put clean, sustainable, and carbon-friendly transportation equipment at the forefront of their operation strategies. In fact, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently highlighted 75 companies that received the agency’s SmartWay Excellence Awards, where companies lead their industries by improving freight efficiency and contributing to cleaner air throughout their supply chains.
“The EPA is recognizing leaders in sustainable freight and transportation, an industry that has proven — particularly in this last year — to be absolutely vital to our economy and our way of life,” said Karl Moor, deputy assistant administrator for EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation, in a FleetOwner article. “There is not a family business anywhere in America, a Fortune 500 company, or farm that doesn’t rely on the freight system in some way.”
On average, the transportation system moves about 49 tons of freight valued at more than $53 billion per day, Moor said. More than 72% of this freight — 80% by ton and more than 70% by revenue — moves by truck. Nearly 8 million people are employed by trucking-related jobs, of which 3.6 million are truck drivers, Moor added.
According to Karl Simon, director of EPA’s Transportation and Climate Division, transportation is also the largest contributor to the nation’s climate emissions. Freight currently accounts for about a third of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions. Globally, freight activity is expected to quadruple by 2050 with associated emissions increases, he said.
Acquiring newer, more efficient heavy-duty trucks through innovative programs
To combat this, fleets are now leveraging critical data, analytics and innovative programs through procurement strategies and life cycle cost management (LCCM) for their Class 8 truck fleets. Implementing an asset management strategy based on shorter vehicle life cycles conserves fuel, reduces emissions, lowers maintenance costs, provides a cleaner environment, and is more economically sustainable.
These programs promote sustainability through optimizing vehicle specification to be more fuel efficient, and to align with the duty cycle as well as geographical locale. Newer specifications include lighter components that allow for longer maintenance intervals, which reduces environmental hazmat waste disposal.
Today’s advanced truck life cycle analytics allow fleets to leverage business intelligence to lower fuel costs by monitoring various metrics of fuel economy, ultimately contributing to a greener environment.
The key in accessing this insight is leveraging data to identify a truck’s tipping point – the point in which it costs more to operate an older truck model than it costs to exchange for a newer more fuel-efficient model. As an example, a recent analysisfrom Fleet Advantage shows that upgrading to 2021 model year truck from a 2016 model would reduce CO2 by 21 metric tons and NOx by 15%. Additionally, this would result in a $16,856 per truck savings. In a fleet of 100 vehicles, that would equate to $1,685,600.
Over time, the true value add is to downstream older truck models into the secondary market, creating an ongoing effect of reduced emissions.
The use of data analytics in truck replacement has been proven to be highly effective. This approach was utilized by a Global-2000 and Top 100 Private Fleet health-conscious wholesale grocer that carries and distributes products to customer locations throughout the U.S. and Canada. The company has over 1,500 Class 8 truck vehicles and runs about 100,000 miles per year. Under the program, the company saved more than 8,500 metrics tons of CO2 as well as helped conserve 848,575 gallons of fuel. Additionally, the company cut costs in their fleet, saving millions of dollars in operating expenses.
America depends on transportation as the backbone of the economy, ensuring that critical goods are moved from one point to another. As we begin a new year and a new presidential administration, a renewed focus on sustainable infrastructure with clean transportation systems will be a key priority. Companies that realize shorter life cycles on trucks, with a strong emphasis in replacing with cleaner equipment will be the true leaders in the economic recovery.

 Traffic can be a real pain. Check out this post about IoT and traffic management in smart cities!
By Manohar Parakh
A smart city is classified as a place where citizens live well-organized urban life with the help of information and communication technology (ICT) while maintaining sustainability and causing the least harm to the environment. In greater detail, this means living in a city that plans smart infrastructure and urban services to keep them as efficient as possible. Citizens can easily interact with local bodies, thus, playing a larger role in the city’s management.
A smart city is a place where all the city’s systems like water management, waste management, healthcare, policing and governance, smart buildings, education, energy, etc. are managed in an optimal fashion that benefits citizens, government, and the environment. Reduction in cost and resource consumption is integral to the layout of a smart city. And, all this is impossible without this offshoot of ICT — the IoT technology that can offer governing bodies with real-time solutions for all urban challenges.
What Is IoT?
The Internet of Things or IoT is basically a network of interconnected devices, like sensors and smart devices, that pass on information to each other and a supreme console via the internet. It is that way that we interact with our belongings. All these devices generate data that is so humongous in the amount that it will need hi-tech cloud applications to store, process, and mine. This process is conducted by big data analytics. Any smart city project will use big data to capture, store, process, and analyze large amounts of data generated by several sources and to transform the data into useful knowledge that enables better decision-making processes.
How Big Data and IoT are Being Used in Traffic Management
Traffic management is one of the biggest infrastructure hurdles faced by developing countries today. Developed countries and smart cities are already using IoT and big data to their advantage to minimize issues related to traffic. The culture of the car has been cultivated speedily among people in all types of nations. In most cities, it is common for people to prefer riding their own vehicles no matter how good or bad the public transportation is or considering how much time and money is it going to take for them to reach their destination.
Thus, the increased use of cars has caused an immense amount of traffic congestion. Several countries are overcoming this traffic bottleneck by fetching information from CCTV feeds and transmitting vehicle-related data to city traffic management centers to help create improvements. Better-organized traffic systems mean a better flow of vehicles on the road, and it means no idling cars, buses, and trucks in traffic jams. All this eventually translates to lower run times, proper utilization of natural resources (gas), and less pollution. The emittance of gases is the largest during stop-start driving, and this happens in spots where traffic is regulated by lights. Hence, if you go for smart traffic, this helps in pollution reduction throughout the entire city.
However, smart traffic management also involves other factors, like smart parking sensors, smart streetlights, smart highways, and smart accident assistance amongst other things.
Traffic Lights
Traffic lights that use real-time data feeds are being used to smooth traffic load. Sensors mounted at strategic places can use IoT technology to gather data about high traffic junctions and areas diverting vehicles from these places. Big data can analyze this information further and figure out alternative routes, as well as better traffic signaling to ease congestion. Meanwhile, road-side lights can also work according to weather sensors mounted on them. Dimming of light happens not only as a part of the day-night process but also when weather conditions turn murky. Roadside light sensors can pick up these signals and turn them on and off accordingly.
Smart Parking
Parking has become an Achilles heel in the urban planning scenario. Lack of parking spaces, as well as parallel parking, has heightened traffic snarls at important junctions in cities. IoT-based sensors in parking lots can give out real-time information about empty spots to cars coming from a long distance and looking for a parking space. Such sensors have already been installed in European cities like Paris, France, and Kansas in the US. They have all seen remarkable results with a double-digit percentage reduction in parking issues observed in the span of a year.
Smart Assistance
Road accidents have been one of the top causes of deaths across the world. However, what adds to this gloomy number is the untimely help and assistance to victims in these accidents. CCTVs and sensors on roads can help in locating accident spots and communicating these to the nearest emergency rooms. Once this communication is established in time, all else can be better handled. 
Challenges
All pros become more quantifiable with cons. While IoT and big data present a path-breaking opportunity in smart traffic management and solutions, they also have some limitations. Firstly, current cities already suffer from infrastructure issues like road planning, zoning, and other construction-related issues that could potentially pose problems when implementing IoT technology.
Secondly, all these fancy, hi-tech solutions need high-speed data transfer techniques and, thus, can work only in cities with great internet connectivity. If for any reason, this connectivity is hampered, the entire smart city could fall apart.
Thirdly, the number of devices accessing the central network means more opportunities for hackers to conduct their malicious attacks. An added layer of security, apart from the usual one and another on top of that, will be needed to make an impenetrable hack-proof smart traffic solution. Data privacy will also have to be maintained, looping in lawmakers and engineers.
Conclusion
Traffic is a crucial aspect that determines a city’s livability factor and efficiency status. Population surge will stop mattering if data and sensors are used capably to manage traffic. As smart cities evolve and increase in number in the coming years, IoT and big data will play a key role in the development and integration of services and infrastructure. With passing time, other issues besides traffic, like waste management, energy conservation, etc., will greatly benefit from the growth of IoT and big data.

 By investing in solutions that improve communication and collaboration and provide end-to-end visibility across the supply chain, CPGs and suppliers will have the insight necessary to make informed decisions that will push their businesses forward. 
By Jason Tham
kamonrat- Global Network
For years, supply chain planners have relied on forecasting to ensure the supply chain is able to react to market and industry fluctuations, and in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry especially, shifting consumer demands. As 2020 showed us, however, there are certain things that even the most comprehensive forecast cannot account for. Without the ability to accurately forecast, how can supply chain leaders ensure their supply chain is able to respond to changes in real time?
By investing in operational agility, which prioritizes communication, collaboration and visibility over demand sensing and scenario planning, supply chain planners have the capabilities to respond quickly to demand and supply variability, maximizing their ability to deliver on-time and in-full despite marketplace volatility.
So, how can supply chain planners put this into practice? 
Digitize the extended network
CPG supply chains are complex, largely due to the broad network of external supply chain partners they rely upon to fulfill orders. While CPGs can adopt new solutions to digitize their internal supply chains, the benefits of these solutions will be limited if there is no visibility into external partners’ activity. For years, these relationships have been managed via phone calls, Excel spreadsheets and emails. Not only does this leave the door open for miscommunications and mistakes, but it also makes it impossible for those in the supply chain to react quickly when speed matters most. 
To overcome these challenges, CPGs must digitally transform their end-to-end supply chain, including their external partner network. Not only do CPGs need to be digitally connected to their external partners, but they also need to ensure that those partners have the digital capabilities themselves to capture and share real-time information from the shop floor.
 By digitizing, CPGs and their partners unlock real-time data in the late-stage supply chain, which allows them to make smart and quick decisions to ensure products arrive at their final destination on-time and in-full. Most importantly though is improved collaboration. With a cloud-based solution that can digitally track all aspects of the shop floor – from production to inventory levels – CPGs and suppliers see every detail of the supply chain in real time via a centralized platform, improving efficiency for all. 
Streamline collaboration with visibility 
One of the most important benefits of a digitized supply chain is the improved relationship between suppliers and CPGs. While many of these organizations have done business together for years, much of the relationship has been transactional or sometimes even adversarial. However, by digitizing operations, both parties can provide the other with unprecedented visibility into each other’s operations and pave the path towards more streamlined collaboration. 
Not only does this deepen trust and mutuality between the two partners, it also allows for the relationship to become more strategic, as those involved have more time to focus on big picture initiatives to improve performance or grow the business vs. spending countless hours manually gathering, tracking, analyzing and sharing data. 
For consumer brands, having visibility into the performance and capacity of their entire network helps them quickly and easily assess attainment against commitments made and available capacity to make future commitments. This ultimately leads to CPGs more consistently meeting or exceeding customer demands, a win/win for all. 
Improve communication with access to network capacity
Disruption is a constant in today’s connected world. While 2020 has caused most to consider “disruption” as something significant – like a global pandemic – in the CPG space it can be something as routine as a rush order being placed. With today’s manual processes, any unexpected change causes stress and cascading downstream impacts on the CPG and the supplier. Oftentimes, CPGs have no way to understand if their network is able to absorb the changes, and suppliers must scramble to determine if they have the capacity to make the change on their production floor. 
With a digitized supply chain that extends throughout the entire partner network, CPGs and suppliers alike have access to data that allows them to make smarter business decisions. By leveraging data gathered by these solutions, decision makers can be sure they are making an informed choice by reviewing things like the availability of raw material, labor and manufacturing capacity. 
They also have access to a dedicated communication channel, helping to reduce the amount of back-and-forth between the CPG and supplier when making these decisions and ensuring all parties are working off the most up-to-date information. With access to real-time information and a centralized communication platform, agility becomes easy, even in the face of disruption. 
While the world works toward “normal” following the upheaval of 2020, the ability to streamline and optimize processes is critical. By investing in solutions that improve communication and collaboration and provide end-to-end visibility across the supply chain, CPGs and suppliers will have the insight necessary to make informed decisions that will push their businesses forward.

Long range drone delivery – greater than 20 kilometers or about 12 miles – is emerging as a fast growing in the autonomous delivery market, according to a new research report.
Short range autonomous delivery has gotten a lot of press recently as companies like Walmart, Amazon, Wing, and UPS engage in high profile drone delivery trials. 
 During the current COVID crisis, contactless delivery has delivered significant benefits to vulnerable communities.  Trials delivering consumer medical supplies from local retail outlets to retirement communities, or library books to local middle school students, demonstrate the benefits of short-range drone delivery.
A new research report from Markets and Markets, however, shows that autonomous delivery of longer distances may be an even more important sector.  
Chinese retail giant JD.com introduced contactless drone delivery in rural areas of China earlier this year: other vendors are exploring medium- to long-range drone delivery for applications such as delivery of parts and supplies along pipeline or transportation infrastructure routes.  
Walmart is testing several short range delivery projects along with one with drone delivery company Zipline to explore longer range routes.
This is a trend that the research report sees continuing.. “Based on range, the long range (>20 kilometers) segment of the aerial delivery drones market and the ground delivery vehicles market is projected to grow at a higher CAGR than the small range (<20 kilometers) segment from 2019 to 2030. 
Increasing demand for the autonomous last mile delivery of packages to long-distance destinations is fueling the growth of this segment of the market,” says a report summary.
While BVLOS flight is still generally not allowed without a waiver in the U.S., the FAA is working to create a framework that supports mid- to long-range drone delivery.  Their efforts are reflected in another conclusion in the report: that North America led the market in 2019 and will continue to drive growth.
“The North American region is estimated to account for the largest share of the aerial delivery drones market in 2019. The growth of the market in this region can be attributed to increased adoption of aerial delivery drones in the food, e-commerce, and logistics & transportation industries of countries such as the US and Canada for delivering their products to customers,” says the Markets and Markets summary.

Decarbonizing the last mile using electric motors and muscles
By Alyssa Sporrer
A day in the office — or biking the streets of sunny Miami — begins at the DHL Service Center for e-cargo bike couriers.
From there, Orlando Rosal makes his way to the REEF Technology garage, where an e-Cargo Cycle is waiting for him. Once he transfers a 60-cubic-foot container onto his bike, he takes off for Brickell Bay and various Miami neighborhoods, delivering packages along the way.
Electric-assisted cargo bikes (e-cargo bikes) have an electric motor, which means that couriers such as Rosal don’t need to be in shape for the next Tour de France or RAGBRAI in order to haul more freight or travel challenging distances. That’s one reason why, according to a study, drivers initially hesitant to try e-cargo bikes often “get a silly grin on their face” after climbing on board the first time.
Even so, couriers can adjust how much physical effort they put forth and how much of the work they want to put on the electric motor as they navigate different landscapes. They could get a full-on workout every day they’re out making deliveries — and many couriers like the option to use the electric assist or be more physically active while working.
“Unlike previous jobs when I might not have had time to go to the gym,” Rosal told FreightWaves, “operating an e-Cargo Cycle for DHL Express keeps me in great shape.”
Riding an e-cargo bike also prompts curiosity among those who see Rosal on the streets, as e-cargo bike couriers are not a common sight in Miami. Rosal said people often ask to take their picture with him, and he is becoming somewhat of a celebrity for his hard work. 
“People on the street are overwhelmingly positive,” he said. 
It’s an acknowledgement that e-cargo bikes have the potential to meaningfully reduce air pollution in cities. In essence, Rosal and others cyclists who perform delivery jobs without need of an internal combustion engine are seen as do-gooders.
Rosal’s bike courier position became available when DHL Express and REEF partnered with the city of Miami to implement a pilot project featuring three-wheeled e-Cargo Cycles in 2020. According to DHL Express, e-Cargo Cycles have the capacity to carry 400 pounds of cargo, and each one saves an estimated 101,000 kilograms of CO2 emissions annually. 
That’s the greenhouse gas (GHG) equivalent that about 22 passenger cars emit in a year, according to the EPA.
E-commerce and food delivery business then skyrocketed in the last year during the pandemic, expanding the demand for home deliveries. Parcel delivery companies such as UPS, DHL and Amazon, along with restaurants and food delivery companies, are deploying an increasing number of e-cargo bikes in major urban areas. 
“Alleviating the stresses on freight flows in these areas can have a positive impact on productivity, congestion, health and well-being, as well as carbon reduction,” noted a 2020 study titled, “Delivering the last mile: Scoping the potential for e-cargo bikes,” which was conducted by the University of Salford in Manchester, U.K., and funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council’s DecarboN8 project.
E-cargo bike fleets require a lot of work to implement
Government regulations, population density and courier safety are just a few things to analyze when trying to get a fleet of e-cargo bikes operational in a city.
Obtaining approval of e-cargo bikes through state and city councils can be one of the most difficult parts of implementing an e-cargo bike fleet, Greg Hewitt, CEO at DHL Express, said in an interview with FreightWaves. That’s why, in addition to doing in-depth research related to demographics, population density and traffic, companies like DHL and REEF work closely with cities before rolling out e-cargo bikes. 
It’s all about the motivation, Hewitt added. Cities with greater noise pollution, air pollution, parking and traffic issues are more likely to be in favor of e-cargo bikes, especially if they have environmental goals to reduce GHG emissions.
Along with government approval, perhaps even before venturing down that path, a high population density within close proximity to charging hubs needs to be confirmed. 
Claudio Innocente, senior vice president of operations and last-block deliveries at REEF Technology, said that a 2- to 3-mile delivery radius is ideal for e-cargo bike efficiency.
“High-density urban areas are where we’ve seen success” deploying e-cargo bikes to replace van routes, 1-for-1, Hewitt said. 
Vertical delivery markets where a courier can pull up to an apartment building, park and deliver several packages on different levels of the same building are very efficient, he added.
Not all buildings have the infrastructure to install several e-cargo bike charging stations, so DHL partnered with REEF to use its charging infrastructure. Hewitt said the company otherwise would have had to retrofit older buildings. DHL is considering things like charging infrastructure and hub location when designing new urban logistics hubs to work well with e-cargo bikes and electric delivery vans, he added. 
REEF Technology has about 4,800 locations in 50 cities that touch 70% of North America’s “densely populated urban areas,” according to company information. It often sets up logistics hubs in underutilized parking garages.

Assuming the infrastructure is there, and governments are on board, costs and courier safety are still major concerns for companies. 
E-cargo bikes can be almost the same price as a secondhand van, ranging in price from $2,000 to $7,000, according to the Salford study. While electric cargo bikes are significantly more expensive than regular bikes, they are still cheaper than electric and diesel delivery vans or trucks. The maintenance and operating costs for e-cargo bikes are also much lower than those for delivery vehicles, the study said.
Since the REEF-DHL partnership is in Miami, they have not had to deal with many weather-related issues there. Hewitt said that couriers are protected from the elements. Innocente said that REEF Technology targets cities where e-cargo bikes can be used year-round, but it still has hubs in locations like Seattle and New York City. 
Along with protection from the weather, these e-cargo bikes are designed with safety in mind. Though couriers do not need a special license, they have to complete training for operating e-cargo bikes.
“The bike courier is seen as a bit of a dangerous job,” Hewitt said. 
In movies and on TV, there is a stigma to overcome that bike couriers are not overly safe. Hewitt said that DHL Express has only had positive feedback in Miami, boasting that there have been no injuries, accidents or complaints from the city thus far.
The Salford study said that GPS systems and the size of e-cargo bikes improve courier safety. Though they are large compared to traditional bicycles, e-cargo bikes have limited space for packages compared to delivery vehicles.
On especially busy days, Rosal said that he has to return to the REEF garage to pick up more freight in order to finish his route. This sometimes frustrates him because he likes to complete his work as efficiently as possible.
Lot of hoops to jump through just for some bikes. Why bother?
Many companies are setting ambitious GHG emission-reduction targets, but reducing emissions that contribute to climate change is just one of the many benefits of using e-cargo bikes.
E-cargo bikes can help reduce noise and air pollution in cities. They have zero tailpipe emissions and very few overall emissions when compared to diesel or electric delivery vans. Because of this, their contribution to air pollution in population-dense cities is virtually nonexistent.
Innocente believes that e-cargo bikes have “more than a lot” of potential to help decarbonize the last mile.
The Salford study said that one business could reduce CO2 emissions 75% by switching deliveries from vans to e-cargo bikes whenever possible. 
Air-quality concerns and limits on particulate matter and NOx emissions have led cities to implement low-emissions zones or ban diesel vehicles altogether, a 2020 study called “Vehicle requirements for electric cargo bikes in commercial transport” and conducted by the Ministry of Economics Baden-Württemberg noted.
These regulations force companies that rely on deliveries for food or other packaged goods to rethink their delivery fleet. 
Along with environmental and health concerns, e-cargo bikes alleviate parking, traffic and congestion issues in cities. Some cities such as New York have started to put congestion pricing in places where traffic is especially heavy. 
Depending on regulations and city setups, e-cargo bikes can drive on the road or use bike lanes and bike-friendly zones such as parks to bypass and maneuver through busy, bumper-to-bumper traffic. 
Larger e-cargo bikes can be more difficult to maneuver through traffic since they generally weigh more and have a wider turn radius, the Salford study said. Cities with a more robust bike lane network and bike parking privileges make e-cargo bikes seem like a more attractive option. 
Some cIties are giving e-cargo bikes privileges to park in commercial parking zones previously set aside for delivery trucks and some are even waiving meter fees, the Ministry of Economics study said. This means couriers can pull up to their delivery location, park right in front of a building, drop off their parcels and be on their way. 
Meanwhile, delivery trucks and vans waste time driving back and forth or around to block to find a spot. They often end up double parking illegally and blocking bus and vehicle traffic, congesting streets even more. 
At the same time as demand for home deliveries is rising, the Ministry of Economics study said, heavy traffic makes it harder and harder to deliver packages on time.
Perceptions that e-cargo bikes are slower than vans are inaccurate because the speed limits are typically 12-15 miles per hour in the busy urban zones where they travel anyway, Innocente said. There is an argument that e-cargo bikes are faster overall because of traffic and parking issues that vehicle drivers have to deal with. 
Rosal said that he is able to complete his route more quickly and provide better service for DHL customers because he can temporarily leave an e-Cargo Cycle in bicycle parking areas on sidewalks and streets long enough to make deliveries and pickups.
All of these benefits make bike couriers’ jobs easier, which is important because companies implementing e-cargo bikes need courier buy-in.
“I think our couriers are overall very supportive of sustainability efforts and like the idea,” Hewitt said.
Rosal added that he is proud to be able to deliver packages without contributing to GHG emissions and air pollution. 
Choosing your wheels
Choosing the right kind of e-cargo bike depends on the application. Hot food deliveries and parcel deliveries have completely different requirements. 
Hot food needs to be kept in a container or bag warmer. E-cargo bikes for this purpose are often two-wheeled with smaller containers because couriers need to make more trips back to the restaurant in between food deliveries. The two wheels allow couriers to navigate through traffic more nimbly and squeeze into even tighter parking spaces.
Using e-cargo bikes for parcel deliveries requires a higher capacity for space and weight. These e-cargo bikes sometimes have cargo on a trailer in the back, have a cargo container in front of the handlebars or have a cargo container right behind the courier.
DHL has deployed many four-wheeled Cubicycles in Europe, which reduce energy use by up to 90% when compared to electric vans. Apart from a 2019 pilot project in New York City, only two- and three-wheeled e-cargo bikes have been approved in the U.S., Hewitt said. 

“One of the challenges with the European version we have is the minute they have four wheels, it’s almost like they’re looked at differently. They get classified as a proper van or vehicle, and they’re subject to a lot more restrictions and limitations,” Hewitt said. 
Europe has a more developed infrastructure for biking and walking, and it is more progressive, so it has been easier for DHL Express to implement e-cargo bikes there, Hewitt added. “The Netherlands loves bikes, so they were able to get past the four wheels.”
Cubicycles often get stuck in city council, while the three-wheeled e-Cargo Cycles move through much faster, he said. 
Though four-wheeled e-cargo bikes like the Cubicycle can haul more freight, Innocente said that REEF Technology has only attempted to deploy two- and three-wheeled e-cargo bikes. 
“The three wheels is the best compromise between activity, size and stability,” Innocente said. 
DHL Express is hoping to deploy e-cargo bike fleets in additional cities such as Los Angeles, Washington and Chicago by the end of 2021, Hewitt said.
Despite challenges with regulations, population density, costs and courier safety, e-cargo bikes have the potential to reduce GHG emissions in urban environments. While their efficiency is only meaningful in densely populated cities, e-cargo bikes could play an important role in decarbonizing the last mile.
And if you happen to see Rosal atop his e-Cargo Cycle on the streets of Miami, feel free to ask for a photo. He won’t mind.

By Evan Ackerman
For self-driving vehicles, full autonomy might not be quite as full as you think
In January, Waymo posted a tweet breaking down what “autonomy” means for the Waymo Driver, which is how the company refers to its autonomous driving system. The video in the Tweet points out that Level 1, 2, and 3 autonomy are not “fully autonomous” because a human driver might be needed. Sounds good. The Waymo Driver operates at Level 4 autonomy, meaning, Waymo says, that “no human driver is needed in our defined operational conditions.” This, Waymo continues, represents “fully autonomous driving technology,” with the Waymo Driver being “fully independent from a human driver.” 
Using the term “full autonomy” in the context of autonomous vehicles can be tricky. Depending on your perspective, a vehicle with Level 4 autonomy fundamentally cannot be called “fully” autonomous, because it’s autonomous in some situations and not others, which is where the defined operational conditions bit comes in. The folks behind these levels of autonomy, SAE International, are comfortable calling vehicles with both Level 4 and Level 5 autonomy “fully autonomous,” but from a robotics perspective, the autonomy of the Waymo Driver is a little more nuanced.
While humans may not be directly in the loop with Waymo’s vehicles, there’s a team of them on remote standby to provide high-level guidance if a vehicle finds itself in a novel or ambiguous situation that it isn’t confident about handling on its own. These situations won’t require a human to take over the operation of the vehicle, but they can include things like construction zones, unexpected road closures, or a police officer directing traffic with hand signals— situations a human might be able to interpret at a glance, but that autonomous systems notoriously find difficult.
There’s nothing wrong with the approach of having humans available like this, except that it raises the question of whether a Level 4 autonomous system should really be called fully autonomous and fully independent from a human driver if it sometimes finds itself in situations where it may decide to ask a remote human for guidance. It may seem pedantic, but having a clear understanding of what autonomous systems can and cannot do is very important, especially when such topics are becoming more and more relevant to people who may not have much of a background in robotics or autonomy. This is what prompted Waymo’s tweet, and Waymo now has a whole public education initiative called Let’s Talk Autonomous Driving that’s intended to clearly communicate what autonomous driving is and how it works.
In this same spirit, I spoke with Nathaniel Fairfield, who leads the behavior team at Waymo, to get a more detailed understanding of what Waymo actually means when it calls the Waymo Driver fully autonomous.
IEEE Spectrum: Can you tell us a little bit about your background, and what your current role is at Waymo?
Nathaniel Fairfield: I’m currently a Distinguished Software Engineer at Waymo looking after what we call “behavior,” which is the decision-making part of the onboard software, including behavior prediction, planning, routing, fleet response, and control. I’ve been with the team since we were founded as the Google self-driving car project back in 2009, and my background is in robotics. Before Waymo I was at the Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute (where I received my Ph.D. and Masters) working on robots that could map complex 3D environments (ex: flooded cenotes in Mexico) and before that, I worked at a company called Bluefin Robotics building robots to map the ocean floor. 
How does Waymo define full autonomy?
When we think about defining full autonomy at Waymo, the question is whether the system is designed to independently perform the entire dynamic driving task in all conditions in our operational design domain (ODD) without the need to rely on human intervention, or whether it requires a human to intervene and take control in such situations to keep things safe. The former would be full autonomy, and the latter would not be. The delta between the two is the difference between the L4 system we’re developing at Waymo (the Waymo Driver) which is responsible for executing the entire dynamic driving task, and L2 or L3 systems.
What are the specific operational conditions under which Waymo’s vehicles cannot operate autonomously?
Our current ODD in Phoenix, where we have our fully autonomous service Waymo One, is around 130 km2 (larger than the city of San Francisco). This area is broad enough to cover everyday driving, which includes different roadway types, various maneuvers, speed ranges, all times of day, and so on. Our ODD is always evolving as our technology continues to advance. Just like a competent human driver, the Waymo Driver is designed so that it will not operate outside of its approved ODD. The Waymo Driver is designed to automatically detect weather or road conditions that would affect safe driving within our ODD and return to base or come to a safe stop (i.e. achieve a “minimal risk condition”) until conditions improve.
If Waymo’s vehicles encounter a novel situation, they ask a remote human supervisor for assistance with decision making. Can you explain how that process works?
Imagine you’re out driving and you come up to a “road closed” sign ahead. You may pause for a bit as you look for a “Detour” sign to show you how to get around it or if you don’t see that, start preparing to turn around from that road and create your own detour or new route. The Waymo Driver does the same thing as it evaluates how to plot the best path forward. In a case like this where the road is fully blocked, it can call on our Fleet Response specialists to provide advice on what route might be better or more efficient and then take that input, combine it with the information it has from the onboard map and what it’s seeing in real time via the sensors, and choose the best way to proceed.  This example shows a few basic properties of all our fleet response interactions:
The remote humans are not teleoperating the carsThe Waymo Driver is not asking for help to perceive the surrounding environment; it can already do that. It’s asking for advice on more strategic planning questions based on what it’s already perceived. The Waymo Driver is always responsible for being safeHuman responses can be very helpful, but are not essential for safe driving
What are some examples of situations or decision points where the Waymo Driver may not be able to proceed without input from a human?
In addition to construction, another example would be interpreting hand gestures. While that’s something we’ve improved a lot on over the last few years, it’s a common scenario the Waymo Driver likes to call on Fleet Response for at times. The Waymo Driver can perceive that someone may be using hand signals, such as another road user waving their hands, and then it will call on Fleet Response to confirm what the gesture appears to be signaling and use that input to make a decision about when and how to proceed.
This is completely dynamic and depends on the specific scenario; not “all construction zones” or “all novel situations” will the Waymo Driver engage with Fleet Response. There are some dead ends or construction zones, for example, where the Waymo Driver may not need to call on Fleet Response at all. Those are just examples of some common scenarios we see Fleet Response utilized for—cases where the Waymo Driver may call on Fleet Response, but does not have to.
So the “driving task” is sometimes separate from “strategic planning,” which may include navigating through situations where a human is giving directions through hand signals, busy construction zones, full road closures, and things like that. And remote humans may at times be required to assist the Waymo Driver with strategic planning decisions. Am I understanding this correctly?
Zooming out a bit (this may get a little philosophical): are tasks made up of layers of behaviors of increasing levels of sophistication (so as to be able to cover every eventuality), or is it possible to carve off certain domains where only certain behaviors are necessary, and call that the task? A simplistic example would be tying your shoelaces. Does it include what I do most every day: putting on the shoe, tying the knot? Or does it also include dealing with a nasty knot that my son put in the laces? Or include patching the laces if they break? Or replacing if the break is in a bad place? Or finding new laces if I have to replace the lace? Or going to the store if I need to buy a new lace?
If it’s the first case, even humans aren’t really individually autonomous, because we rely on other individuals for assistance (changing a tire), public works (installing a traffic light), and social decision-making (traffic management of a small-town July-4th parade). If it’s the second case, then there is an endless discussion to be had about exactly where to draw the lines. So in some sense, it’s arbitrary, and we can agree to disagree, but what is the fun of that? I would argue that there are certain “useful” distinctions to draw—where there are certain sets of capabilities that allow an agent to do something meaningful.
And to clarify—this isn’t just Waymo’s perspective, it’s actually how SAE makes these distinctions. SAE essentially defines the dynamic driving task (DDT, or what the Waymo Driver is responsible for) as involving the tactical and operational functions required to operate a vehicle, which are separate from strategic functions.
EDITOR’S NOTE: According to SAE, the dynamic driving task includes the operational (steering, braking, accelerating, monitoring the vehicle and roadway) and tactical (responding to events, determining when to change lanes, turn, use signals, etc.) aspects of the driving task, but not the strategic (determining destinations and waypoints) aspect of the driving task. SAE’s definition of Level 4 autonomy involves the driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene.
What is the disengagement rate for Waymo’s vehicles when they are operating with passengers? What are the most frequent causes of disengagements?
“Disengagement” usually refers to when a vehicle operator in the car switches the mode from autonomous to manual. With our fully autonomous service, we don’t have vehicle operators in the car so there’re technically no “disengagements” the way the term is generally understood. We do have a roadside assistance team who can assist the vehicle (and switch it over to manual control, if appropriate) while on the road but we don’t have metrics to share on those interactions. But, the idea that these disengagement rates should be deducted from autonomy and that anything that ever gets stuck isn’t “fully autonomous” is flawed. Under that definition, human drivers aren’t “fully” autonomous! It would be sort of silly to say that “Nathaniel is 99.999% autonomous because he had to call a tow truck that one time.” 
I agree that it would be silly to say that Nathaniel is only 99.999% autonomous because he had to call a tow truck, but that’s because most people don’t consider that to be part of the driving task—I think it might be less silly to say that Nathaniel is only 99.999% autonomous if he sometimes can’t drive through construction zones or can’t reroute himself if he encounters a road closure.
When you get into a taxi, you don’t ask yourself whether the driver has a particular license to drive on a particular road, or whether you’ll have to jump into the front seat to grab the steering wheel. You just assume that they can get you to your destination without any intervention. When you get in a vehicle driven by the Waymo Driver, you can safely make that assumption! It doesn’t mean that your human taxi driver can’t look for advice in some situations, nor does it mean that the Waymo Driver can’t do the same. 
Additionally, and as noted above, we think the SAE distinctions are helpful in determining what constitutes the dynamic driving task that an L4 automated driving system like the Waymo Driver must be able to perform, including that the DDT does not involve strategic functions. The examples you reference here are either functions the Waymo Driver can perform (such as driving through a clearly marked construction zone) or are examples of where the Waymo Driver receives information or clarification of some facts to facilitate its performance of the DDT. Human drivers (like the taxi driver!) receive information to inform their driving from radio reports, navigation devices, or even from asking adjacent motorists in stopped traffic what they see ahead, and in a confusing situation might ask a traffic officer how to get around a crash area.
So your perspective is that a system can be accurately described as “fully autonomous” if it sometimes relies on a human for strategic decision making?
Yes. the Waymo Driver is a fully autonomous driver in the Phoenix service area, and I think most roboticists would agree with me there! This is because for the purpose of driving our riders to their destinations, the Waymo Driver makes all the decisions related to the dynamic driving task.
What robotics research (besides your own, of course!) are you most excited about right now?
I’ll be honest, our research at Waymo into high-capability decision-making systems that promote safety and interact naturally with humans is about as cool (and challenging) as it gets! It involves reasoning about uncertainty (and our own limitations in sensing and interpretation), reasoning about the intentions of other agents, and how the actions of other agents will change depending on our actions, and using millions of miles of real world driving experience and cutting-edge machine learning to accelerate progress in behavior. I’m also very impressed by both the mechanical engineering and sophisticated footstep planning shown by Boston Dynamics they are doing some really elegant robotics. And a part of my heart belongs to exploration robotics too, be it under water, under ice, or on other planets (or in the case of Europa, all three). It’s the combination of rock-solid mechanisms, robust autonomous capability, and ground-breaking scientific discovery.

The need to have a human somewhere in the loop for strategic edge cases is a very robot-y thing, and perhaps that’s why it’s incorporated into the SAE’s autonomy levels. And technically, Waymo is absolutely correct to call its vehicle fully autonomous based on that definition. I think the risk, though, is that people may not intuitively understand that “full autonomy” only applies to the dynamic driving task, and not the strategic planning task, which (for humans) is an integral part of what we tend to think of as “driving.”
What I’d really like to know is what happens, some number of years from now, after Waymo has solved the strategic planning part of driving (which I’m sure they will). Because at that point, the Waymo Driver will be more autonomous than it was before, and they’ll have to communicate that somehow. Even fuller autonomy? Full autonomy plus? Overfull autonomy? I can’t wait to find out.

The world has long been waiting for the 5G mobile broadband network. As consumers clamor for better services and faster delivery of goods, a lot of industries have been hoping to speed up their internet connections to meet this demand. Thankfully, the dawn of 5G is upon us.Gartner’s predictive analysis reveals that 5G networks will start to roll out this 2020 through network-based mobile communications service providers. Through this, 20.4 billion connected things will be spread out and utilized all over the world. Certainly, the 5G mobile broadband network will soon become the industry standard ⁠— especially in smart cities ⁠— so supply chain players need to carefully strategize in order to fully utilize this technology.Organizations, people, and activities that are directly connected to the supply chain will benefit greatly from the 5G mobile network, no matter how big or small their enterprises are. Here, we’ll take a look at how 5G is set to revolutionize how supply chains work.
Enhance LogisticsOne way that 5G is set to improve the supply chain is by upgrading the logistics tech that transportation and delivery industries use. As companies constantly track and trace products to ensure successful delivery, a lot of pressure has been put in keeping this process optimized to prevent customer dissatisfaction and failure to provide goods. With 5G, supply chain enterprises will have higher visibility the minute a delivery truck departs a warehouse, guaranteeing a seamless transition from one location to another.As 5G offers an almost instantaneous connection between logistic teams, delays in delivery and scheduling can now be mitigated. Furthermore, artificial intelligence-led projects like self-driving trucks ⁠— which will soon be a smart city staple and were pioneered by Kodiak Robotics in 2018 ⁠— will be safer, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly if connection is done through the 5G network.Improve Communication Between FleetsCommunication is vital in the supply chain, as miscommunication causes delays in operations, which in turn, spell massive dips in profits for various industries. As 5G connects users with groundbreaking speeds, there’s a significantly lower chance for communication mishaps to happen. Furthermore, 5G allows teams to send and receive information almost instantaneously.With this, fleets can communicate tons of useful information as soon as their sensors pick up data, which can also lead to a huge efficiency boost. An article titled ‘The Intelligent Fleet: Bridging the Communications Gap’ by Verizon Connect points out how this can lead to performance insights being applied immediately across fleets and drivers. 
The end result, then, would be that logistics fleets would be constantly updated with the best schedules, routes, and ways to deliver goods. In smart cities where efficiency is highly regarded, the benefits of 5G networks in keeping supply chain fleets connected will further drive higher profits for the affected enterprises.Better Inventory Management
5G will also change the way supply chain industries approach inventory and warehouse management. For one, the technology used in logistics is closely tied with the one used for tracking goods in the warehouse, so 5G’s superior network will be incredibly beneficial in making collection, delivery, and archiving more efficient. Inbound and outbound goods will be managed with ease, and collection of data insights to improve operations (just like how smart cities improve their infrastructure and public service) will all be faster if done through the 5G network.
Another great application of 5G in warehouse management is the use of augmented reality (AR) to keep track of goods inside the warehouses. A GS1 survey reports that the average inventory accuracy only lands at 63%, so supply chain warehouses need new tech to help raise this statistic. Thankfully, we have AR to supplement this. Coupled with 5G, AR allows warehouse managers to have a visual of their environment with information through computer-generated graphics. So in real-time, warehouse workers can plan a warehouse’s layout of goods in advance by superimposing computer-generated photos of the products on shelves and storage.
Overall, 5G is more than just a step forward into the future. As this technology mitigates communication loss and enhances internet speeds, industries involved in the supply chain can make leaps and bounds in improving their services, encourage more efficient operations, and drive higher profits.

Vehicles are getting connected. That’s a good thing. But they are getting connected in haphazard and slapdash ways, and that’s not good at all. Each car has multiple connectivity needs and, to date, car makers tend to satisfy each need by adding another, different connection. The electronics industry is eager to provide consolidated connectivity solutions, but most major automobile companies remain dedicated to developing proprietary technologies, which means auto makers and their suppliers are figuratively reinventing the wheel on a constant basis.
What follows is an overview of the connectivity requirements by the automobile industry. We then compare several solutions offered by some of the more prominent vendors in the electronics industry.
Why connect?
In-vehicle infotainment systems and telematics units have become top priority for over-the-air (OTA) software updates. Carmakers plan to add new apps and services — ranging from car-sharing to detecting fuel levels — without redesigning the car. A flood of audio and video streaming media — via Wi-Fi, 4G and 5G — is washing over vehicles.
Cybersecurity demands OTA. When there’s a hack, nothing is more important to car OEMs than the agility to send software patches — stat. For software-rich vehicles, OTA is their BFF. Because there is no such thing as bug-free software, vehicles must be prepared to correct software errors.
The next frontier of OTA updates is happening in the whole car. Carmakers need to be able to target not just TCUs (telematics control units) but also the various ECUs, developed by different chip vendors, installed in each vehicle. These ECUs are tasked to control various parts of a vehicle, ranging from engine control to air bags and seat adjustments.
Connectivity must go two ways. Besides the ability to send software patches, carmakers must be able to extract information from vehicles. In the era of highly automated vehicles, massive sensory data generated by cameras, radars and lidars needs to be aggregated, processed, stored and sent to the cloud for AI training. Possibly in a consistent format.
Last but not least, data collected by connected vehicles must be analyzed.
In short, connected cars cover a lot of ground. Connectivity empowers the automotive industry to develop and add new apps and services. Connectivity supports road safety, sends cybersecurity fixes, and advances machine learning. “Car-to-cloud” connected vehicles are a huge market. Every tech supplier, OEM, tier one and tier two is chipping away at it.
Painting a rosy future for connected vehicles is easy. More difficult is figuring out which connectivity solutions are doing what. Bear in mind that no one has gotten all the connectivity pieces down. Anyone who claims to have an “end-to-end” solution doesn’t.
Tower of Babel
At issue is not a lack of building blocks to design connected vehicles. The real concern is that carmakers — as they have done for decades — continue to develop proprietary solutions designed for one but exclude the rest of the industry.
Players in the connected vehicle field — car OEMs, tier ones and tier twos — are building a “Tower of Babel,” observed Mark Singer, director of marketing at Excelfore. An OTA software update solution offered by one company, or designed for one model, for example, does not necessarily talk to another model even within the same company.
Three driving forces for connectivity
The lay of land for connected vehicles is complex. There are, however, three key forces driving vehicles to connect to the cloud.
First is the emergence of “software-defined” vehicles. “Cars are becoming software,” said Raj Kanaya, general manager of automotive and chief marketing officer at Aeris.
Second, 5G and the “infinite scalability of the Internet,” as Harman calls it, are making carmakers rethink how to deliver features and content to a vehicle. Tim Van Goethem, vice president, advanced mobility solutions at Harman, sees the promise of 5G and the Internet enabling car OEMs to “keep adding new features to a vehicle throughout its entire life cycle.”
Third, “data is reshaping the autonomous vehicle (AV) value chain.” Massive data collected for AV applications is making the cloud “an essential building block,” as Danny Kim, partner and director at VSI Labs noted in his company’s technology brief.
Against this backdrop, we will examine who’s who in the connected vehicle market, while breaking down who’s addressing which segments of the car-to-cloud conundrum.
Qualcomm’s Car-to-Cloud Platform
Qualcomm launched its Car-to-Cloud Platform this month at CES.
If you are naïve enough to believe that the vehicle of the future is “a smartphone on wheels,” you might conclude that Qualcomm leading the car-to-cloud revolution is a no-brainer. Hold that thought.
When EE Times asked Qualcomm which parts of the connected vehicle market its Car-to-Cloud Platform is designed to address, Nimish Shrivastava, senior director of product management, gave a measured response. Qualcomm’s immediate mission is to enable carmakers to boost their vehicle’s connectivity performance from 4G to 5G without car OEMs having to change the hardware.

Shrivastava said Qualcomm’s Car-to-Cloud Platform has two key features. One is something called “Soft SKU.” The other is security directly built into connectivity chips. Soft SKU lets field-upgradeable chips “securely support new functionality as performance requirements increase or new features become available.” It ensures a smooth transition from 4G to 5G and enables “regional customization and feature upgrades tailored for specific product segments,” according to Qualcomm. By leveraging its capabilities, OEMs can customize a single SKU for multiple tiers and markets. That, in the end, will help automakers save costs associated with dedicated investments in multiple SKUs, Qualcomm claimed.
Qualcomm’s Car-to-Cloud platform also gives carmakers a flexible way to provision data usage. Shrivastava explained that it’s probably not okay for carmakers to charge consumers for the data usage in OTA updates, for example. Connected car vendors should offer different billing systems, while providing plans to bundle data, services and new user experiences in a flexible manner, said Shrivastava.
Too little too late?
Incumbents of the connected vehicle business see Qualcomm’s entry in the crowded connected vehicle market as “too little, too late.” Greg Basich, associate director of automotive practice at Strategy Analytics, pointed out Qualcomm’s inexperience in managing the lifecycle of a vehicle. Qualcomm also lacks knowledge of ECUs supplied by different chip vendors and designed into different vehicles. Supporting Qualcomm’s own chip in its own Car-to-Cloud platform is one thing. Presenting itself as a serious car-to-cloud panacea for the whole industry is entirely another. “Qualcomm’s car-to-cloud service must be decoupled with Qualcomm’s own chip,” Basich said.
Shrivastava acknowledged the need for Qualcomm’s platform to support other chips in the future. But for now, Qualcomm sees its mission in filling certain gaps it has found in current telematics solutions. Soft SKU will be important for Qualcomm, because all major OEMs are scrambling to make their connected vehicles “future proof.” With Soft SKU’s ability to activate new features – as needed – at device level, Qualcomm will add “life-time value” to their chips deployed in connected cars, Shrivastava said.
Given the complexity of vehicle architecture, the automotive industry can’t simply re-purpose OTA update technology originally invented for mobile phones. That mobile OTA technology cannot update, for example, brake systems, because it lacks the means to extract the necessary delta from a variety of ECUs, whose resources — memory and processing power — are severely constrained.
Nonetheless, Shrivastava insisted that Qualcomm knows something about “bringing different players together” in the “ecosystem.” Qualcomm hopes to replicate in the automotive ecosystem its own success in bringing network operators, content owners and software developers together to enable advancements in features and content of smartphones.
VW-Aeris joint venture
Earlier this week, Volkswagen Group of America announced the formation of a joint venture, called Ventic LLC, with Aeris.
The new JV grew out of a relationship VW had with Aeris. In 2017, the two companies worked together to develop “an IoT platform” to support the embedded connectivity module in cars, a VW spokesperson explained. The JV’s work will include “OTA updates to the embedded connectivity module,” she added.
Beyond that, both VW and Aeris declined to detail Ventic’s mission.
The idea to form a JV appears to have come from both companies’ top management. The decision parallels a major organizational shift announced by VW last fall “to bring hardware and software design all in house.”
Aeris is a “world-class software company” which has gained credibility among automotive OEMs, Kanaya asserted. To enable car-to-cloud, Aeris offers a mobile suite consisting of TCU and platforms for connectivity, devices and mobile applications. So far, Aeris’ connectivity platform has earned design wins among many car OEMs, said Kanaya. Since 2017 when Aeris struck a deal with Mitsubishi Motors, it has been rolling out additional device and mobile application layers atop the connectivity platform. Aeris also offers “cloud-independent” solutions to customers.

As comprehensive as Aeris’ block diagram above looks in terms of supporting new applications and services in vehicles, Aeris’ solutions remain focused on the TCU.
Phil Magney, the founder of VSI Labs, told EE Times that the VW-Aeris JV is “all about creating a unified telematics platform to support current and future connected services.” This, however, does not support “the iterative data handling cycles necessary to manage a software-defined vehicle architecture,” he added.
Put simply, it’s not built for whole-car OTA updates.
Knowing OEMs’ workflow
Asked why Aeris has not ventured into enabling OTA software updates on a variety of ECUs, Kanaya said that the current car architecture can’t yet support it. Whole-car OTA updates must wait for the consolidation of more ECUs inside a vehicle, and for the in-vehicle network architecture to get upgraded.
Where Aeris’ expertise shines, however, is its understanding of OEM workflow, Kanaya explained. If an OEM is adding new features to100,000 vehicles over the air, the process must mesh with the carmaker’s workflow — database, notification, detecting if updates failed or succeeded, etc.
Asked about Aeris’ technical edge, he pointed out, “We have the ability to add new services very quickly.” While end users often suffer from a longer response time to get software updates — sometimes as long as 30 seconds to one minute, Kanaya stated, “We’ve optimized the process to less than three seconds.”
Competitive landscape
So, who does Aeris compete against in the field of OTA updates for connected vehicles? Kanaya said, “We mostly compete with car OEMs and tier ones who are developing their own OTA solutions.”
This walled-garden approach, still prevalent in the auto industry, seems an antiquated business practice. But the reality is, as Strategy Analytics’ Basich explained, “Automakers hate to use something developed or used by other automakers, even if the technology is free and open.”
There is no shortage of examples of carmakers pursuing their own OTA solutions in collaboration with tech suppliers. They include Ford-Autonomic-AWS partnership, Jaguar Land Rover-CloudCar.
BlackBerry, QNX and AWS unveiled a new partnership at the CES earlier this month. The deal, aimed at automotive OEMs, promises to deliver “services, personalization, health monitoring, and advanced driver assistance (ADAS) in vehicles.”
Wind River and Airbiquity announced their own partnership last year, promising a “software lifecycle management solution for connected and autonomous vehicles, one that spans vehicle to cloud.” Under the agreement, Wind River contributes a highly modular, OTA update and software lifecycle management solution. Airbiquity provides “OTA orchestration, campaign management, software and data management, and Uptane-based security framework capabilities.”
300 million connected vehicles
All that said and done, it’s hard to beat Harman, a Samsung company, according to Strategy Analytics’ Basich. Harman’s remote vehicle update service, already selected by 23 major global OEMs, manages more than 30 million connected vehicles. In the eyes of Harman, connected vehicles are already here. It expects the number of connected cars to grow to 300 million in the next five years.
Harman does everything from personalized cloud content to new apps and services configured in the vehicle. But does Harman cover OTA updates on ECUs? That appears to be a different story. It hasn’t happened yet in the current-generation connected vehicles.
It’s the data pipeline, stupid!
In Strategy Analytics’ Basich’s mind, OTA updates for a whole car fall into an entirely different bucket. Excelfore and Aurora Labs are the companies leading that charge.
Excelfore’s Singer observed that few in the automotive industry are focusing on developing a coherent data pipeline that connects from server in the cloud to vehicles, and vehicles to devices inside a vehicle.
Car OEMs tend to be opportunistic, developing a proprietary solution for the moment’s needs. If they build a data pipeline, it serves one purpose in each new model in each new car.
The industry, however, must move faster to whole-car updates and data gathering, according to Excelfore’ Singer. He pointed out that if automakers are serious about perfecting autonomous driving technology, they must be able to pull data — how the software is performing in the real world — consistently. “It bothers me that the automotive industry is talking up autonomous driving, and yet they haven’t even figured out how to do the whole-car OTA updates, or extracting data from a vehicle” in a consistent manner, he said.
Common protocols
The first step in this journey is for the industry to devise a common protocol for messaging over the data pipeline. It must allow the server to talk to each client in the same language, while letting the server probe for the presence of a certain ECU or a sensor inside a vehicle. That probing must take place in order to assess each ECU’s ability to process OTA software.

OTA software updates for the whole car are not as simple as just downloading software updates. In explaining his company’s mission, Aurora Labs’ CEO Zohar Fox once asked following questions:
Can current OTA update solutions roll back to a previous software version if a problem occurs with the new version? Can they avoid re-distribution of the previous software versions, and write them again on the flash?
Is it possible to update new functionality without rebooting?
Can the solution support different car ECUs: infotainment, safety, powertrain, ADAS, chassis, body and comfort? More important, can it support such ECUs today and in the future, using the same technology?
Can the OTA-update solution meet the reflash time and power requirements of the production line? Can the ECUs be updated with the latest software versions prior to leaving the factor?
Does the OTA solution require client integration work by all ECU vendors in the vehicle ecosystem?
All these questions remain relevant for anyone who tries to do whole-car OTA updates.
It’s critical to proactively analyze the health and performance of lines-of-code deployed on Automotive ECUs (Source: Aurora Labs)
Excelfore is achieving this by building a client-server architecture and creating an abstraction layer that allows a software “agent” to know specific characteristics of a device in a vehicle. This lets Excelfore send various car OEMs’ OTA software updates directly from the company’s eSync cloud platform to different electronics devices.
Aurora Labs, in contrast, is working similarly, not by creating software agents but by compiling a software library including codes from different ECUs, explained Strategy Analytics’ Basich. “It’s a very unique approach.”
Excelfore, in early 2018, provided the company’s eSync technology to an open trade association called eSync Alliance. The Alliance is making steady progress, according to Singer.
As for eSync market deployment, Singer said, “We expect to see five automakers shipping eSync-based vehicles in 2020 in China, Japan and Europe.”
None in the United States yet, however. Last fall, FAW, one of China’s largest automotive manufacturers, announced deployment of the eSync platform. FAW’s new cars, currently in production, allow OTA updates targeting 33 devices — from 24 different suppliers — designed into a vehicle, Singer boasted.
Strategy Analytics’ Basich concluded that although whole-car OTA updates appear slow in coming, recently announced automotive processors will soon realize the next-generation automotive architecture. Whether it is NXP Semiconductors’ new gateway processors, or Texas Instruments’ ADAS and gateway processors, semiconductor suppliers rolling out these new chips know they must make the automotive industry’s number one wish — over-the-air software updates — come true, à la Tesla. Every OEM is jockeying to make their vehicles software upgradeable.

The startup TuSimple is deploying tractor-trailers that drive themselves from pickup to delivery
 By Evan Ackerman
Companies like Tesla, Uber, Cruise, and Waymo promise a future where cars are essentially mobile robots that can take us anywhere with a few taps on a smartphone. But a new category of vehicles is about to overtake self-driving cars in that leap into the future. Autonomous trucks have been quietly making just as much, if not more, progress toward commercial deployment, and their impact on the transportation of goods will no doubt be profound.
Among nearly a dozen companies developing autonomous trucking, San Diego–based TuSimple is trying to get ahead by combining unique technology with a series of strategic partnerships. Working with truck manufacturer Navistar as well as shipping giant UPS, TuSimple is already conducting test operations in Arizona and Texas, including depot-to-depot autonomous runs. These are being run under what’s known as “supervised autonomy,” in which somebody rides in the cab and is ready to take the wheel if needed. Sometime in 2021, the startup plans to begin doing away with human supervision, letting the trucks drive themselves from pickup to delivery without anybody on board.
Both autonomous cars and autonomous trucks rely on similar underlying technology: Sensors—typically cameras, lidars, and radars—feed data to a computer, which in turn controls the vehicle using skills learned through a massive amount of training and simulation. In principle, developing an autonomous truck can be somewhat easier than developing an autonomous car. 
That’s because unlike passenger vehicles, trucks—in particular long-haul tractor-trailers—generally follow fixed routes and spend most of their time on highways that are more predictable and easier to navigate than surface streets. Trucks are also a better platform for autonomy, with their large size providing more power for computers and an improved field of view for sensors, which can be mounted higher off the ground.
TuSimple claims that its approach is unique because its equipment is purpose built from the ground up for trucks. “Most of the other companies in this space got the seeds of their ideas from the DARPA Grand and Urban Challenges for autonomous vehicles,” says Chuck Price, chief product officer at TuSimple. “But the dynamics and functional behaviors of trucks are very different.”
The biggest difference is that trucks need to be able to sense conditions farther in advance, to allow for their longer stopping distance. The 200-meter practical range of lidar that most autonomous cars use as their primary sensor is simply not good enough for a fully loaded truck traveling at 120 kilometers per hour. Instead, TuSimple relies on multiple HD cameras that are looking up to 1,000 meters ahead whenever possible. The system detects other vehicles and calculates their trajectories at that distance, which Price says is approximately twice as far out as professional truck drivers look while driving.
Price argues that this capability gives TuSimple’s system more time to make decisions about the safest and most efficient way to drive. Indeed, its trucks use their brakes less often than trucks operated by human drivers, leading to improvements in fuel economy of about 10 percent. Steadier driving, with less side-to-side movement in a lane, brings additional efficiency gains while also minimizing tire wear. Price adds that autonomous trucks could also help address a shortage of truck drivers, which is expected to grow at an alarming rate.
TuSimple’s fleet of 40 autonomous trucks has been hauling goods between freight depots in Phoenix, Tucson, Dallas, El Paso, Houston, and San Antonio. These routes are about 95 percent highway, but the trucks can also autonomously handle surface streets, bringing their cargo the entire distance, from depot driveway to depot driveway. Its vehicles join a growing fleet of robotic trucks from competitors such as Aurora, Embark, Locomation, Plus.ai, and even Waymo, the Alphabet spin-off that has long focused on self-driving cars.
“I think there’s a big wave coming in the logistics industry that’s not necessarily well appreciated,” says Tasha Keeney, an analyst at ARK Invest who specializes in autonomous technology. She explains that electrified autonomous trucks have the potential to reduce shipping expenses not only when compared with those of traditional trucking but also with those of rail, while offering the door-to-door service that rail cannot. “The relationships that TuSimple has made within the trucking industry are interesting—in the long term, vertically integrated, purpose-built vehicles will have a lot of advantages.”
By 2024,TuSimple plans to achieve Level 4 autonomy, meaning that its trucks will be able to operate without a human driver under limited conditions that may include time of day, weather, or premapped routes. At that point, TuSimple would start selling the trucks to fleet operators. Along the way, however, there are several other milestones the company must hit, beginning with its first “driver out” test in 2021, which Price describes as a critical real-world demonstration.
“This is no longer a science project,” he says. “It’s not research. It’s engineering. The driver-out demonstration is to prove to us, and to prove to the public, that it can be done.”

 What holds MaaS together is the underlying digital mobility platform that is open, data-driven and capable of providing a level playing field for all service providers for the benefit of citizens. 

By Emmanuel de Roquefeuil
According to an estimate, India’s urban population will increase from 377 million in 2011 to 594 million in 2036 – a growth of 57 percent. This will be a significant addition of people to cities already stressed with limited resources. Amongst others, traffic congestion is already one of the foremost challenges to city authorities. Longer journeys raised levels of pollution, a higher number of automobile accidents, and a lowered quality of life would be among those challenges requiring the urgent attention of city planners and authorities.
The country, having seen rapid urbanization, is expected to keep adding people to its bustling cities even as the novel coronavirus halts, and indeed reverses, albeit temporarily, a migration to the country’s urban areas. This may clog India’s urban streets in the future and prevent mobility from providing what it essentially should: freedom of movement.
Today in India, we are faced with a couple of situations when it comes to urban mobility. On one hand, we have multiple modes of travel ranging from private vehicles like bikes and cars to public transport like metro rail and buses. On the other hand, we have a discerning urban commuter with expectations of commutes that can be customized, are sustainable and importantly, accessible via phones.
Not all of this is easy with differing modes of payment and challenges with route planning. This often leads to people falling back to their private cars and other forms of transport even if there are better options available. The statistics are telling: on an average India adds more than 50,000 cars per day adding to the congestion and pollution on its streets.
As the country looks forward to develop the smart cities of the future, what can be the option to plan your travel or daily commute in a better way? One that considers different modes of travel and the associated planning and payments in a seamlessly integrated manner on a single platform which could belike a smartphone app.
This is the premise of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) where different forms of transport are presented as options before the traveler on a single and integrated platform. This service can be anchored around a core of metros, buses and trains and complemented by shared services like cars and bikes. This ties in both public and private transport modes to present suitable options to the traveler.
The user needs to access MaaS on his or her phone, plan the journey, make payments using the phone itself, and simply switch between travelling modes to reach the destination. This is beneficial for both the traveler and the city authorities, as travel becomes more efficient and more sustainable.
What holds MaaS together is the underlying digital mobility platform – which is open, data-driven and capable of providing a level playing field for all service providers for the benefit of citizens. Above all, the platform must be cyber-secure to safeguard the privacy of users. Thales, a recognized player in the field of cybersecurity, relies on its expertise and its research laboratories in defense to offer all its customers robust solutions that allow them to benefit from the advantages of modern signaling  and digitalization.
It is this platform that offers route planning, booking, ticketing, customer services and payment on a single platform. Services can be consumed on the go, or bundled into a product or subscription and consumed as-a-service. This one platform must consider aspects like mode of transport, price, journey duration and real-time traffic and weather conditions.
For its effective performance, this platform needs to have certain attributes.
It must also allow for interoperability by defining standards that bring together diverse offerings and technologies seamlessly. It must also be able to improve the overall transport ecosystem and user experience by leveraging the rich depository of analytical data that it will hold. Entry barriers must also be lowered to enable participation from diverse transport providers. Lastly, as a repository of data, the platform should be secure and trustworthy.
To account for the rising population, and hence the number of commuters, of our cities, the system must also be scalable, modular and have an open cloud-based architecture to account for the rise in the number of mobility users. At the same time, authorities should be able to easily integrate the system into existing revenue collection systems to provide a seamless fare collection stream.
All this must happen while providing sufficiently high levels of cyber security to protect the privacy of users. The approach should be to address cyber security concerns at every stage of the information security lifecycle. Thus ‘Mobility as a Service’ platforms can enable city transport authorities and citizens to cope with the growth of mobility demand and traffic congestion in the coming years.

The market size for autonomous last-mile delivery is intensifying day by day and is expected to grow to almost 85 U.S. billion dollars by 2030. The demand for autonomous last-mile delivery occurred at an even faster pace than we expected back in 2016. For example, autonomous robots and drones were conceptual in 2016, and now, we see the large-scale deployment of robotics and drones in last-mile deliveries. 
The last-mile delivery process is coined as the most integral part of present-day shipping companies. Today logistic companies’ are not only focusing on shipments from the transport hub, but they are also testing a series of technology solutions at every stage of last-mile delivery.  This kind of extensive growth makes the last-mile carrier a strength for all retail companies, not a setback. The goal will be to deploy technology solutions that could minimize the delivery time, ensure transparency, and minimize cost with smart vehicles for last-mile operations.
The New Generation of Last-Mile Delivery
As a share of operational shipping costs, the last-mile delivery costs are substantial and 53% overall. New technologies, software, and tools, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, can quickly identify inefficiencies in the last-mile algorithms. In this post, you’ll see how AI can be applied in practical situations to minimize problems in last-mile delivery. The new generation of AI will give retailers the ability to optimize their last-mile carrier, leading to the simplification of processes and performance.
To survive the market competition, supply chain enterprises are only left with the option of optimizing last-mile delivery with technology solutions, including AI and machine learning. Successful last-mile strategy pillars are determined by speed, accuracy, efficiency, transparency, and, most importantly, a positive customer experience. Covid-19 and lockdown have changed the usual shopping ways and added more pressure on supply chain companies to ensure faster and more quick last-mile deliveries for customers.    
Technology trends, especially AI in the last-mile, stood out during this disruptive phase of the pandemic. Whether big or small, supply chain enterprises must implement AI technology for improved last-mile operations in the future. We’ve all heard of stories of deliveries not showing up on time. This puts pressure on logistics companies to make it right. In this line, NextBillion AI, an industry-leading startup, recently announces custom map API solutions for telematics and last-mile logistics. The global geocode API solutions handle factors such as inconsistency in managing hours of operations, drive-pattern, and drive-time by using the advanced ML algorithm. 
Let’s speak about the Amazon delivery that has begun using AI-equipped cameras across its delivery fleets. This allowed Amazon to scale up their last-mile deliveries as cameras are equipped with artificial intelligence software capable of detecting 16 different safety issues, including distracted driving, hard braking, and whether the driver is not wearing a seatbelt.
A Constantly Changed Landscape of AI in Last-Mile
Smarter ways of last-mile delivery are coming up. Implementation of AI in last-mile logistics is gaining momentum. In the coming years, there will be increased adoption of artificial intelligence for improved last-mile fulfillment. Smart tech optimizes not-mile operations and reduces human dependency that can fetch great business results in the long run. Today, enterprises consider investing in Artificial Intelligence to optimize their last-mile operations. Here is how it works.
Artificial Intelligence processes machines and software systems using human intelligence. AI has changed the ways businesses handle their logistics. This technology has the maximum impact on a company’s last-mile operations and, in the process, optimizes issues such as routing, visibility, allocation of resources, and parcel sorting. Here we will see how AI in the last-mile delivery can help logistics companies make significant optimization to compete effectively.
AI Led Geocoding
The complexity of the supply chain process increases with the number of drop locations. As the shipping volume increases, the last-mile deliveries can get complicated when distributions to be done in remote areas. The customers also write unclear addresses. Location is crucial to logistics companies and service providers looking to tailor the final steps of last-mile delivery to their customers. With Artificial Intelligence and algorithms-led geocoding, even the unclear of addresses can be converted into precise locations on a map. Accurate AI-enabled geocoding helps delivery companies to reach customer destinations faster, which leads to a higher delivery rate.
Geocoding helps to maintain accurate address information to improve accuracy in the final steps of delivery to customers in the digital age. On the other hand, inaccurate data can result in late or no deliveries and poor communication with customers.
Geocoding provides you not only precise location data but also enables the validation of pickup and delivery addresses. Geofencing is another critical component of a delivery network that ensures real-time pickup and delivery notification, reducing wait time for drivers and lowering shippers’ costs. Ingeocoding, AI aims to find and gather insights to build the best possible geospatial data by detecting patterns, outliers, and trends and understanding the distribution of data across cities, states, or countries.
The second thing is to get the data on a map. The technology helps create a map with a location that can be the center point of your data. Users can add the points to the map. With these technological features, we can make critical decisions to gather data insights.
Using AI in Geocoding, businesses can identify segmentation patterns and plot points on a map more effectively. Also, it is useful in fraud prevention by identifying unusual activity on a customer location. 
AI-Backed Route Planning & Optimization
Thanks to Artificial Intelligence, route planning, and optimization are simpler and more useful than ever. AI route planning facilitates on-time deliveries even when companies deal with a high volume of packages and heavy traffic congestion. Route optimization is one of the most important advancements within logistics technology, coupled with continued improvements in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. The ability to automatically plan optimal last-mile delivery routes is significantly improving than ever before. 
As the eCommerce supply chain and logistics industry experienced the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic, those involved in the business realized the importance of planning and preparing better for the future. Traditionally eCommerce companies relied on zip codes for the last-mile delivery of shipments. But today, companies started creating their zones or warehouses for last-mile deliveries. However, for delivery during the festive season, hefty volumes throw off the company’s zones. This is why companies search for route optimization software that guarantees optimal delivery routes and automated recommendations for the best-suited vehicle based on the volume of shipment, delivery requirements, geographical conditions, and shipment type.
One central area of AI in route planning and optimization is creating plans and routes according to driver requirements. With Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, logistics companies can plan routes based on the driver’s performance and multiple variables. This technology trend will set companies to ensure faster last-mile delivery by utilizing real-time data and historical patterns for planning and optimization. This saves time, and more importantly, less time spend on route planning and optimization means less expenditure, fewer drivers paid hours, and less demand for delivery vehicles.      
AI to Gain Last-Mile Visibility 
Last-Mile visibility is the ability to track products during transit. Today, 93% of consumers want to stay more informed about their products’ location throughout the delivery process. This puts pressure on organizations to gain last-mile visibility from in-transit status to final delivery of products. Last-mile visibility is backed by AI and machine learning that allows for tracking and tracing parcels in real-time and identify issues in the process, thereby allowing companies to take proactive action to prevent customer pain.
According to a survey by Capgemini, 83% of shippers believe that last-mile visibility is a crucial factor for growth. The technology-backed solution for fleet tracking offers multiple checkpoints for tracking a package when it is received or transferred to its final destination. Customers will be alerted with emails and notifications that provide visibility throughout the delivery stages in real-time. For example, FedEx uses a tracking tool, InSight, that utilizes reference numbers for tracking orders. Amazon delivers a MapTracker to guide a delivery driver about the dropoff destination. Amazon Locker is a tool that alerts customers via text messages and emails when their package is dropped off at their residence or any other location for pickup. 
As AI continues turning businesses around, it has been proven that companies have nothing to fear for unpredictability in tackling routes, weather, and address related issues. As the market moves toward a more automated future, retailers will need to tackle these challenges with technology-backed solutions to work toward perfecting their last-mile delivery, which can further refine their last-mile visibility and transparency. If done well, this results in improved accuracy and profits and proves to be a competitive advantage for any organization.
Conclusion: Think Outside the Box
The future of your eCommerce business is in your hands now. To stay competitive, retailers will need to invest in AI-backed last-mile strategies. Several useful AI and ML applications exist in today’s landscape that aid a shipping company to ensure that deliveries are completed with full transparency and visibility. So, think out of the box with AI and machine learning that simplifies human efforts in the last-mile logistics operations and ultimately paves the way for businesses.

Cities across the globe have experienced a major setback due to the COVID-19 crisis. From global supply chains to the stock markets, a majority of day-to-day operations came to a screeching halt. However, different cities have responded to the pandemic in different ways. Several trends were triggered due to coronavirus, including a mass switch to remote workplaces and an emphasis on digital transformation as a whole. Smart cities were already working in the direction of entirely digitalizing urban mobility. Now, the pandemic provided a much-needed momentum to these efforts. Find out how Smart Cities level up in the COVID-19 crisis.
Urban mobility and the pandemic
The spread of coronavirus has dramatically impacted the mobility patterns across regions.
A vast majority of the working class switched to a “work from home” setting as business travel, domestic or international, came to a standstill for weeks altogether. Companies and employees accepted the remote work culture quite commendably. However, as the world is undergoing adjustments in the ‘new normal’ phase, safe mobility alternatives are being encouraged by the administrators globally.
Singapore’s Senior Minister of State, Dr.JanilPuthucheary, expressed the need for innovative planning models post COVID-19 in a speech in March 2020. He communicated the need to include the prospects of natural disasters/outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, while formulating future policy models. Also, he addressed the need for more flexibility in the transportation planning process to accommodate unprecedented circumstances.
New transportation and mobility solutions to get back on track
With the imminence of new technologies, services, and products, significant disruption is dawning upon the transportation sector. Governments across the nations have implemented new mobility systems. Policymakers are targeting convenient, cheaper, and more sustainable mobility alternativesfor their citizens.
Autonomous vehicles
Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been pilots for quite many years now. Nonetheless, the global pandemic has shown a considerable effect on the deployment of AVs across smart cities. The likelihood of AVs in public transport service, even after the containment of the coronavirus, has increased.
Public transit autonomous vehicles align with the safety measures of social distancing. For instance, the Jacksonville Transportation Authority (JTA) is carrying critical testing and medical supplies with the help of their AV fleet service provider — Beep and NAVYA (French AV builder). This has helped the authorities to keep their staff members safe from exposure to the contagious virus. The AVs will eventually become part of the Ultimate Urban Circulator program of JTA.
MaaS
MaaS or ‘mobility as a service’ saw a shift in consumer behavior with less traffic during the lockdown. However, electric scooters or bike-share, among other micro-mobility services, have expanded their horizons to serve vulnerable localities.
Provisions for cleanliness with frequent sanitization and physical distancing with glass shields between passengers and drivers emerged as the simplest way to utilize public and shared transportation. Mobility aggregator apps allow users to schedule journeys using a wide range of modes of transport and to select routes that fit the social distancing criteria. MaaS has offered convenient and cheap modes of transportation with the reliability of safety to people and has public mobility getting back on track at a notable pace.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) at service
Sophisticated technologies such as deep learning and AI are being proactively implemented in the public transport sector.
In terms of proactive safety management, AI is being used to record the temperature of boarding passengers through thermal-screening cameras. A more advanced approach- ThermalPass, utilizes sensors to assess external body temperature through the radiated heat. Furthermore, to replace human contact, touchless ticketing systems, special travel cards (like Singapore’s ez-link card), and cashless payment options are used. Employing AI to regulate the use of public transport for maximum operational efficiency has also paid off well for technologically-rich regions.
Further, actionable insights into mobility demand such as the estimated time to the destination location, and AI-based sensors to guide travelers to practice social distancing in queues and waiting areas are under implementation across smart cities.
Other critical advancements include automated securement systems for wheelchairs to omit the need for human contact. Several technology-powered mobility solutions are on the cards to get the mobility and transportation sector back on track.
The bottom line
Governments have done their bit by offering discounted fares to free transport for health care and essential workers. However, without the enablement of technological solutions, achieving desired outcomes is challenging. Cities and regions that were undertaking ‘smart city’ initiatives, before the spread of coronavirus, are revisiting their urban mobility planning models to incorporate touchless or low-contact tech solutions. 
Defining a sustainable future mobility model and tackling the immediate effect of COVID-19 is a collective effort of human and technological resources in smart cities. On these grounds, smart cities are undeniably ahead of competition with their tech-enabled transport and mobility measures. You might have got the about how smart cities level up in the COVID-19 crisis.

Big data is offering many very promising opportunities for the fleet management industry in the face of great uncertainty. 
 By Ryan Kh 
According to a forecast by IDC and Seagate Technology, the global data sphere will grow more than fivefold in the next seven years. The total amount of new data will increase to 175 zettabytes by 2025, up from 33 zettabytes in 2018.
This ever-growing volume of information has given rise to the concept of big data. And I do not mean large amounts of information per se, but rather data that is processed at high speed and has a strong variability. Nowadays, managers across industries rely on information systems such as CRMs to improve their business processes. The domain of logistics is no stranger to innovations either.
Within the industry, the management of data allows T&L businesses to take productivity, efficiency, and safety to a whole new level. Besides, the analysis of data is beneficial for the bottom line as it cuts unnecessary costs and expenses.
It won’t be an exaggeration to say that big data has reinvented the way a modern fleet operates. Big data eliminates all the guesswork and allows fleet managers to make purely informed decisions. So, without further ado, let’s see how it works in detail.
Maintenance
All in all, the concept of big data is all about predictive analytics. Such data is great for introducing revamped maintenance practices. Thanks to the availability of comparative data for practically every type/model of a vehicle, fleet managers can plan maintenance activities based on certain knowledge. This practice results in lowered maintenance costs for fleets of any size. What’s even more important, predictive analytics prevents accidents on the road. This way, company drivers feel that they work in safe conditions.
Predictive analytics takes care of both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include depreciation, interest, repair and maintenance costs, tire changes, insurance, fuel, taxes, and fees. Indirect costs are usually more difficult to calculate, but they have a significant impact on the bottom line and include administrative staff time, driver downtime, etc.
The industry is continually changing, so if you want to successfully plan your budget, it is essential to effectively use the available funds in the present. Undoubtedly, the cost of maintaining a fleet depends on many factors, but data helps you figure out what works best for your fleet here and now.
Fuel Management
Fuel costs are rising globally. According to statistics, fuel costs account for nearly 40% of overall expenses for a fleet. The proper data analysis provides fleet managers with an opportunity to monitor the total fuel costs and see the weak points. For instance, it’s easier to identify idling trucks that waste fuel.
Data also helps in identifying improper routing that usually leads to excessive fuel consumption. Statistics reveal that companies relying on data management reduce total miles driven by 10%. Finally, data management helps fleet managers analyze fuel price fluctuations so that they can plan budgets wisely.
Safe Driving
There’s no use to explain why safe driving is important, and big data helps to outline the behavior patterns of drivers. With that info at hand, the introduction of proper training within a fleet is just a matter of time. Telematics via sensors installed in a truck provides exact data on drivers’ behavior. Here we talk about such parameters as vehicle speed, acceleration, braking, fuel consumption, and other nuances that allow you to build a “profile” of the driver.
For example, drivers who violate speed limits and drive aggressively do waste more fuel than the ones that drive responsibly. And I don’t even mention that it’s dangerous. It’s an absolute necessity to persuade their drivers to be safe and efficient on the road. Telematics go as far as restricting using phone calls or texts while on the route.
To Sum Up
Industry professionals claim that data is “the new oil,” and one couldn’t agree more. The only challenge is just learning how to use it effectively. There are no universal algorithms for exploring data. However, managing your fleet using Big Data gets so much easier if you are using proper fleet management software. With such solutions, fleet managers can classify all the data and make a list of business goals to reach. Data analysis is a field for imagination: as a fleet manager, you need to think, build and test hypotheses taking into account the specifics of the T&L industry.
In the era of big data, advanced data analytics enable multiple decisions to be made throughout the vehicle’s lifecycle. The data collected from vehicles means preventive maintenance, and managers can know all about their fleets and alert the relevant authorities in case of accidents.

  Autonomous vehicles are known for their slow speed 
Finnish self-driving tech company Sensible 4 — known for its award-winning software that enables autonomous driving in any weather conditions — predicts that smart cities will have a significant impact on the speed of autonomous vehicles.Sensible 4 software doesn’t need purpose-built infrastructure to drive autonomously, but at a later stage, relevant real-time data could improve the driving to higher standards.40 km/h works well in urban areasAutonomous vehicles are known for their slow speed. Most of the vehicles drive with a speed of 20 km/h and even Sensible 4’s faster autonomous vehicles driving 30-40 km/h can be considered to be slow — if compared to highway speeds that are 3-4 times higher.
“For public transportation in urban areas, our speed is enough and the speed is actually higher than other similar vehicles can reach currently,” Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, points out.
Autonomous vehicles anticipate traffic for two or three seconds into the future. In urban areas, where the speed limit is for example 30 or 40 km/h, the braking time and distance are short so stopping the vehicle can be executed safely and smoothly.
Smart cities support autonomous driving
Self-driving vehicles can, of course, drive faster, but to make it safe, it’s more complex. Autonomous driving doesn’t require smart city infrastructure and for example, Sensible 4’s software solution works without external supporting systems. However, at some point as a further step, smart cities can support autonomous driving and help to reach higher standards, like higher speed.
“Higher speeds require longer braking distance and time. This extends the requirements for predicting the traffic, which is impossible at highway speeds. To reach safe driving at higher speeds the autonomous vehicle would have to be sure there are no traffic disturbances ahead, far beyond the measuring distance of on-board sensors. For this we need smart infrastructure,” Santamala explains.
Countries and cities that want to be in the frontline on the new era of driving should start looking into options to support self-driving. Relevant real-time infrastructure data helps with predicting, avoiding incidents, and it can make driving more smooth and safe even at higher speeds.
This data could be for instance about the weather, traffic, and road condition — something that can make the vehicle perform even better. Smart cities can include information relayed to autonomous vehicles via high-speed 5G networks and fixed sensors for example in intersections.
“We believe that autonomous vehicles are on urban roads shortly, within a few years. Building smart cities require cooperation and time, so cities should start planning how their infrastructure supports these vehicles. Also, on the governmental level, the legislation should be prepared for the change,” Santamala states.

A wave of new innovations is enabling government leaders to implement “smart city” technology to improve services to their citizens, increase energy efficiency, and save money. Councils are using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and improved network traffic, energy, air quality, mobility, public infrastructure assets, and more.
All that data is being enhanced and optimised with powerful location intelligence and  management tools such as Confirm Asset Management. The net result is cost efficiency, and improved services.
Parking, public transportation and streetlights
It can be difficult to find a parking space in Barcelona, Spain. However, thanks to a network of smart sensors, information about available parking spaces is made available in real-time to drivers throughout the city. By directing residents to an open parking spot, the city is reducing traffic and pollution while saving its residents time.
Users of public transportation benefit from smart city technology as well. Sensors aboard city buses, for example, can detect whether a bus is ahead of schedule, behind schedule, or right on time. Armed with this information, many cities are providing notifications to users of public transportation, informing them of predicted arrival and departure times.
Some cities are even taking this a step further. If a bus is slightly ahead of schedule, for example, the timing of traffic lights can be adjusted slightly so that the bus is not compelled to sit idle at the next bus stop. 
In London and Quebec, energy-efficient smart streetlights are serving multiple purposes. Sensors detect the presence of pedestrians or vehicles, and the lights are dimmed or turned off when not needed. This feature alone can save as much as 30 per cent on energy costs. 
Smart streetlights are helping in other ways as well. They function as Wi-Fi hotspots and feature charging outlets for mobile phones and even electric vehicles. Surveillance cameras installed alongside the streetlights safeguard the community against crime. Some even have air quality sensors, providing valuable environmental data for city officials.
Smart waste management
While the examples cited above are easy to understand and resonate with a broad audience, there are plenty of other use cases that perhaps seem less cool, but which nevertheless have very real benefits for communities.
Many of us take for granted that when we toss a used coffee cup into a rubbish bin, someone will eventually turn up to empty the bin and take it away. Historically, that kind of service has been provided based on routinely scheduled operations. In other words, we can make a pretty good guess, based on history, as to when that rubbish bin will need to be emptied.
Logistically, there are several inefficiencies here. For one thing, a rubbish bin along the main thoroughfare might fill up much faster than one that is stationed only a block away.
This means that a rubbish truck may end up spending a good deal of its time servicing bins that are less than half-full.
The core problem, though, is that without smart technology, we really don’t know when any of the rubbish bins need to be emptied. If we add sensor technology and connectivity, we can have a real-time view of the city’s waste management needs. We can allocate resources where they are needed and when they are needed, rather than making a best guess about the situation. That saves time and money. With fewer rubbish collection vehicles on the road, it also reduces traffic congestion.
Bike-stands, trees and parking meters
When we start to drill down into all the various assets that are managed and serviced by governments and councils, public asset management begins to look like a daunting task. 
Technology can rein in that complexity. Many of the larger cities throughout the world have implemented bicycle sharing programs centered around public bike-docking kiosks. When someone rents or borrows a bicycle, those kiosks can detect how many bikes are available and share that information to mobile phone users throughout the city. Sensors installed on each bicycle can communicate maintenance requirements to city officials so that units can be efficiently and promptly repaired and put back in service. 
The same principles can be applied to virtually any public asset. Parking meters, for example, will stop producing revenue when they are out of service. By establishing two-way communication between devices such as parking meters and a central asset management system, city officials can be notified promptly of a needed repair and can use mobile technology to deploy maintenance crews in the area to fix the problem.
Trees also require regular maintenance. While it may not make sense to install IoT sensors in the city’s trees, the fundamental need for systems to manage scheduled maintenance remains.
By enabling the smart allocation of resources around maintenance tasks of any kind, local governments increase efficiency and save money.
How the City of Sydney uses infrastructure asset management technology
Sustainable Sydney 2030, a collective vision for “a green, global and connected Sydney” outlines the City of Sydney’s ambitious environmental, economic, social and cultural goals. It is based on a deep commitment to environmental leadership, high levels of service and quality facilities for the residents, businesses and visitors to one of the world’s most livable cities. 
To help realise this vision and comply with legislative mandates, the city must be able to manage the lifecycle of AU$12.7 billion worth of infrastructure assets. 
The City of Sydney selected the Confirm Asset Management platform to manage its wide range of assets and to deliver a mobile solution for the field-based asset managers and inspectors. 
Compounding benefits with location intelligence
All these connected technologies result in a high volume of information that was never available before. Consider what happens when we begin to combine that with some of the other location-based data available to city managers.
If we return to our bicycle sharing example, we might discover some interesting new possibilities. Let’s assume, for instance, that routine use of the bike-sharing service for one-way trips results in a surplus of bicycles in the waterfront area of the city. As a result, city workers must routinely pick up bikes from the waterfront, load them into a truck, and return them to kiosks in the downtown area. That’s a lot of work, and it costs money.
What if city managers were to analyse mobility data to understand where people are at various times of the day? What if they used that data to establish a schedule of incentive pricing for one-way bike trips back to downtown? To take this example a step further, program managers could use mobility services to promote the new incentive pricing to pedestrians who frequent the waterfront area.
The net result will be a win-win; more residents will benefit from using a community resource, and the city will save money in the process. When you consider the volume of data available through smart city technologies and combine that with external location data, a wealth of new opportunities emerges.

The market size for autonomous last-mile delivery is intensifying day by day and is expected to grow to almost 85 U.S. billion dollars by 2030. The demand for autonomous last-mile delivery occurred at an even faster pace than we expected back in 2016. For example, autonomous robots and drones were conceptual in 2016, and now, we see the large-scale deployment of robotics and drones in last-mile deliveries. 
The last-mile delivery process is coined as the most integral part of present-day shipping companies. Today logistic companies’ are not only focusing on shipments from the transport hub, but they are also testing a series of technology solutions at every stage of last-mile delivery.  This kind of extensive growth makes the last-mile carrier a strength for all retail companies, not a setback. The goal will be to deploy technology solutions that could minimize the delivery time, ensure transparency, and minimize cost with smart vehicles for last-mile operations.
The New Generation of Last-Mile Delivery
As a share of operational shipping costs, the last-mile delivery costs are substantial and 53% overall. New technologies, software, and tools, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, can quickly identify inefficiencies in the last-mile algorithms. In this post, you’ll see how AI can be applied in practical situations to minimize problems in last-mile delivery. The new generation of AI will give retailers the ability to optimize their last-mile carrier, leading to the simplification of processes and performance.
To survive the market competition, supply chain enterprises are only left with the option of optimizing last-mile delivery with technology solutions, including AI and machine learning. Successful last-mile strategy pillars are determined by speed, accuracy, efficiency, transparency, and, most importantly, a positive customer experience. Covid-19 and lockdown have changed the usual shopping ways and added more pressure on supply chain companies to ensure faster and more quick last-mile deliveries for customers.    
Technology trends, especially AI in the last-mile, stood out during this disruptive phase of the pandemic. Whether big or small, supply chain enterprises must implement AI technology for improved last-mile operations in the future. We’ve all heard of stories of deliveries not showing up on time. This puts pressure on logistics companies to make it right. In this line, NextBillion AI, an industry-leading startup, recently announces custom map API solutions for telematics and last-mile logistics. The global geocode API solutions handle factors such as inconsistency in managing hours of operations, drive-pattern, and drive-time by using the advanced ML algorithm. 
Let’s speak about the Amazon delivery that has begun using AI-equipped cameras across its delivery fleets. This allowed Amazon to scale up their last-mile deliveries as cameras are equipped with artificial intelligence software capable of detecting 16 different safety issues, including distracted driving, hard braking, and whether the driver is not wearing a seatbelt.
A Constantly Changed Landscape of AI in Last-Mile
Smarter ways of last-mile delivery are coming up. Implementation of AI in last-mile logistics is gaining momentum. In the coming years, there will be increased adoption of artificial intelligence for improved last-mile fulfillment. Smart tech optimizes not-mile operations and reduces human dependency that can fetch great business results in the long run. Today, enterprises consider investing in Artificial Intelligence to optimize their last-mile operations. Here is how it works.
Artificial Intelligence processes machines and software systems using human intelligence. AI has changed the ways businesses handle their logistics. This technology has the maximum impact on a company’s last-mile operations and, in the process, optimizes issues such as routing, visibility, allocation of resources, and parcel sorting. Here we will see how AI in the last-mile delivery can help logistics companies make significant optimization to compete effectively.
AI Led Geocoding
The complexity of the supply chain process increases with the number of drop locations. As the shipping volume increases, the last-mile deliveries can get complicated when distributions to be done in remote areas. The customers also write unclear addresses. Location is crucial to logistics companies and service providers looking to tailor the final steps of last-mile delivery to their customers. With Artificial Intelligence and algorithms-led geocoding, even the unclear of addresses can be converted into precise locations on a map. Accurate AI-enabled geocoding helps delivery companies to reach customer destinations faster, which leads to a higher delivery rate.
Geocoding helps to maintain accurate address information to improve accuracy in the final steps of delivery to customers in the digital age. On the other hand, inaccurate data can result in late or no deliveries and poor communication with customers.
Geocoding provides you not only precise location data but also enables the validation of pickup and delivery addresses. Geofencing is another critical component of a delivery network that ensures real-time pickup and delivery notification, reducing wait time for drivers and lowering shippers’ costs. Ingeocoding, AI aims to find and gather insights to build the best possible geospatial data by detecting patterns, outliers, and trends and understanding the distribution of data across cities, states, or countries.
The second thing is to get the data on a map. The technology helps create a map with a location that can be the center point of your data. Users can add the points to the map. With these technological features, we can make critical decisions to gather data insights.
Using AI in Geocoding, businesses can identify segmentation patterns and plot points on a map more effectively. Also, it is useful in fraud prevention by identifying unusual activity on a customer location. 
AI-Backed Route Planning & Optimization
Thanks to Artificial Intelligence, route planning, and optimization are simpler and more useful than ever. AI route planning facilitates on-time deliveries even when companies deal with a high volume of packages and heavy traffic congestion. Route optimization is one of the most important advancements within logistics technology, coupled with continued improvements in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. The ability to automatically plan optimal last-mile delivery routes is significantly improving than ever before. 
As the eCommerce supply chain and logistics industry experienced the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic, those involved in the business realized the importance of planning and preparing better for the future. Traditionally eCommerce companies relied on zip codes for the last-mile delivery of shipments. But today, companies started creating their zones or warehouses for last-mile deliveries. However, for delivery during the festive season, hefty volumes throw off the company’s zones. This is why companies search for route optimization software that guarantees optimal delivery routes and automated recommendations for the best-suited vehicle based on the volume of shipment, delivery requirements, geographical conditions, and shipment type.
One central area of AI in route planning and optimization is creating plans and routes according to driver requirements. With Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, logistics companies can plan routes based on the driver’s performance and multiple variables. This technology trend will set companies to ensure faster last-mile delivery by utilizing real-time data and historical patterns for planning and optimization. This saves time, and more importantly, less time spend on route planning and optimization means less expenditure, fewer drivers paid hours, and less demand for delivery vehicles.      
AI to Gain Last-Mile Visibility 
Last-Mile visibility is the ability to track products during transit. Today, 93% of consumers want to stay more informed about their products’ location throughout the delivery process. This puts pressure on organizations to gain last-mile visibility from in-transit status to final delivery of products. Last-mile visibility is backed by AI and machine learning that allows for tracking and tracing parcels in real-time and identify issues in the process, thereby allowing companies to take proactive action to prevent customer pain.
According to a survey by Capgemini, 83% of shippers believe that last-mile visibility is a crucial factor for growth. The technology-backed solution for fleet tracking offers multiple checkpoints for tracking a package when it is received or transferred to its final destination. Customers will be alerted with emails and notifications that provide visibility throughout the delivery stages in real-time. For example, FedEx uses a tracking tool, InSight, that utilizes reference numbers for tracking orders. Amazon delivers a MapTracker to guide a delivery driver about the dropoff destination. Amazon Locker is a tool that alerts customers via text messages and emails when their package is dropped off at their residence or any other location for pickup. 
As AI continues turning businesses around, it has been proven that companies have nothing to fear for unpredictability in tackling routes, weather, and address related issues. As the market moves toward a more automated future, retailers will need to tackle these challenges with technology-backed solutions to work toward perfecting their last-mile delivery, which can further refine their last-mile visibility and transparency. If done well, this results in improved accuracy and profits and proves to be a competitive advantage for any organization.
Conclusion: Think Outside the Box
The future of your eCommerce business is in your hands now. To stay competitive, retailers will need to invest in AI-backed last-mile strategies. Several useful AI and ML applications exist in today’s landscape that aid a shipping company to ensure that deliveries are completed with full transparency and visibility. So, think out of the box with AI and machine learning that simplifies human efforts in the last-mile logistics operations and ultimately paves the way for businesses.

The National Transit Database found recently that public transit ridership in the United States plunged 62% in 2020, as COVID-19 took hold. One of the transit sector’s responses, though, has been to embrace health measures like new on-board air filtration systems, face-mask detection systems and, increasingly, contactless payments as a lure to regain those lost passengers.
The National Transit Database, which aggregates data from hundreds of transit agencies nationwide, estimated that 482 million fewer rides were taken in the last year than in 2019, as the pandemic made traveling in enclosed spaces a risky endeavor. Large transit agencies like New Jersey Transit and New York City’s Metropolitan Transit Authority have already experimented with sanitizing trains nightly, installing mask-detection cameras and offering mobile apps that show how crowded railcars are.
But the most popular solution among transit agencies and riders alike has been a growing embrace of contactless payment systems that enable riders to pay fares on their phones rather than using cash or swiping cards.
“The need to keep passengers and staff safe while providing reliable services has never been greater for public transit authorities,” Miroslav Katsarov, the chief executive of contactless payment manufacturer Modeshift, said in a press release. “We’re proud that 20 cities around the world have trusted us to implement contactless fare collection systems on their public transit networks, and we hope that riders feel safer using it.”
Modeshift recently launched its contactless mobile payment app on the local bus lines in Lancaster and Reading, Pennsylvania. The company’s software enables users to scan into public transit through a unique QR code generated on the app once they purchase their fare.
At least 12 of the 37 grants distributed last month by the Federal Transit Administration will be used by transit agencies to procure contactless payment systems like Modeshift’s. The South Central Transit Authority, which operates the bus systems in Lancaster and Reading, has seen improved ridership in the two months since it started taking mobile payments, said Dave Kilmer, the agency’s executive director.
“Since the start of the pandemic, we’ve seen a large decline in the number of public transit users across Berks and Lancaster counties.” Kilmer said in the Modeshift press release. “Since implementing Modeshift’s contactless fare collection system we’ve seen the adoption rate increase week over week, and now, 99% of our public transit users have migrated to the new system and prefer contactless payments for fares.”

It remains to be seen whether the global pandemic and the shift to remote work have permanently slammed the brakes on morning and evening rush hours. If the daily commute ever returns, one innovation made possible by vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology could be the rise of the smart intersection.
Smart traffic management systems are projected to save cities a whopping $277 billion over the next four years by reducing emissions and traffic congestion, according to U.K.-based Juniper Research.
Smart intersection and related technologies are expected to reduce time stuck in traffic by 33 hours per year per motorist by 2025 — a 64 percent improvement in traffic flow and potential road rage.
Along with V2X, smart intersection technologies will leverage 5G interconnectivity along with AI-based automation. Unlike current sensor-based systems, that combination will help manage traffic flows using real-time data.
Those innovations are expected to eventually replace traffic sensors — including inductive-loop detectors embedded in pavement along with infrared and microwave sensors and video cameras. All have largely proven ineffective in reducing those long lines of brake lights.
The market researcher reckons more than 95 percent of the projected $277 billion in savings (rising from $178 billion this year) will be directly attributable to reduced traffic congestion. The European and North American markets are expected to accounted for 75 percent of those savings during the forecast period.
The wild card could be the booming Chinese market, which has rebounded much faster from the pandemic than western countries. Beijing’s series of ring roads, for example, are notorious rush-hour parking lots, and are therefore a prime candidate for advanced traffic management systems.
Attempts at adding lane capacity tend to result in simply adding more vehicles while doing little to relieve congestion. Hence, market trackers argue that smart traffic infrastructure like V2X is a more cost-effective approach than wider roads. By collecting and disseminating data on what’s up the road, “V2X connectivity will enable smart traffic management platforms to gather data directly from vehicles, rather than relying on traditional traffic actuation methods,” Juniper Research concludes.
Unclogging city streets also will require collaboration among automakers and the V2X system providers on other emerging services like smart parking. Investments in technologies designed to help drivers find a parking space are expected to jump from $460 million this year to $1 billion by 2025.
Those investments include displays that provide real-time data on available city parking along with connectivity between parking sensors, management platforms and harried commuters.
Something to think while waiting for those interminable series of red lights to change.

A recent study of roughly two-thirds of the country’s traffic signals revealed that Americans spend about 17.25 million hours waiting for poorly timed signals every day.
The study, published this month by the transportation data company Inrix, tracked the movements of thousands of connected vehicles every five seconds as they moved through roughly 210,000 intersections nationwide. Researchers found that nearly 7% of any car ride was spent waiting at traffic crossings and intersections.
Researchers also tracked certain regions, including Los Angeles County, which topped the study with a total of more than one million daily delay hours, and Brooklyn, New York, which averaged the longest delay per vehicle at 23.5 seconds.
The report concluded that poor signal timing was responsible for roughly 10% of total traffic delay time, double the figure commonly cited by a 2004 report from the Federal Highway Administration.
“Emerging research is concluding that this number is likely much higher, with findings from two states estimating roughly 25% of total delay attributed to signals,” Inrix’s report said. “Our direct measurements of individual vehicles interacting with individual intersections is consistent with this emerging research.”
Regardless of the exact percentage, cities have taken action over the past several years to reduce congestion on their roadways, to reduce emissions and improve quality-of-life for commuting residents.
The FHWA recently funded 10 regional programs, with participation from state and local government and universities, to pilot new technologies built around planning more efficient traffic systems. Inrix itself signed deals last year with several states, including Louisiana, Oregon and Tennessee, to collect more data about traffic congestion.

The fleet industry is experiencing heavy disruption at the hands of technology. All the processes are now going digital, and AI is taking over every segment that involves decision making. 
There’s no doubt that businesses that fail to open up to the changing trends won’t survive the competition because fleet companies with digital processes are already spending less capital, efforts, and time.
Several trends are fast changing the landscape of the fleet industry. If you own a fleet or run a business with its own fleet of vehicles, you have to stay abreast of thetrucking industry updates.
Here are the top trends that are shaping the future of fleet management. 
Ideas That Are Changing The Trucking Industry
1. Telematics And Tracking
Telematics and fleet tracking are redefining how fleet companies executed their assignments. They are not new but will continue to be one of the top trends in the fleet industry. 
Telematics and tracking have helped fleet managers keep an eye on their drivers’ working hours through ELDs. Plus, driver behavior can be monitored via telematics to ensure fleet operators are protected on the road.
Telematics has also been crucial in providing data for inventory and maintenance schedules.
It is expected that more technology will be added to the folds to provide more information than ever before. In the future, telematics and tracking will provide more efficient and precise execution. 
The latest technology will pin-point real-time locations along with the ability to share information with others. These functions will help fleet managers make dynamic changes to routes and pick-up points.  
2. Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning
Since technology grows by the day, you must stay up-to-date with trends such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). 
These innovations in technology have substantially impacted the logistics industry. The fleet domain produces a lot of data needed to reveal trends and identify links, handled very well by AI. 
AI and ML can handle workforce planning, supplier selection, route analysis, warehouse management, and so much more. It has effectively reduced human intervention by taking up decision making in crucial functions. 
AI and ML are expected to further revolutionize the processes by eliminating human-made mistakes and empower companies to avert any bad practices in the workflow. 
Both AI and ML are state-of-the-art technology tools designed to bring visible results and help logistics businesses tackle the most difficult of issues. 
3. IoT
IoT or Internet of Things has disrupted several industries, including logistics. 
This industry required proper co-ordination and effectiveness, and IoT stepped right in the middle of the chaos to offer the best connectivity and internet. 
The arrival of IoT in logistics has resulted in smooth data exchange between multiple elements and teams of a business. This improved flow has further facilitated efficient control of critical assets. 
Fleet managers can now predict risks, check the condition of goods while in transit, forecast traffic congestion, assure proper cargo handling, manage teams, and do more remotely. 
IoT in logistics is here to stay and will significantly shape the sector’s future. It is going to be the backbone of smarter and more predictive fleet management solutions. 
Supporters of IoT expect that the trend will result in huge savings for the industry and substantially reduce emissions produced by the transportation and logistics industry. 
4. Blockchain
Blockchain is often associated only with cryptocurrency, but the truth is, it can do so much more than what we know. It can, in essence, boost the sustainability of the operations that influence the fleet sector.
The logistics industry has been taking advantage of blockchain via decentralized ledgers that improve transparency for customers and let them track the whole journey of their product until it arrives at their door. 
The supply chain sector is in dire need of increasing trust levels, and blockchain can effectively help by further securing digital payments. 
Blockchain can also play a crucial part in the logistics industry with the help of smart contracts. A smart contract enables logistics companies to automate the buying process, minimize red tape, and increase transparency. 
Blockchain is in its initial phases, but it is sure to progress fast and become one of the most popular trends at the core of the transport industry. 
5. Computer Vision
Computer Vision (CV) is a technology that enables computers to identify images and videos. This technology is new to the industry and has found its place in delivery, accident management, and warehouse automation. 
It can handle multiple tasks like barcode reading, warehouse territory monitoring, employee tracking, etc. and be useful in theft prevention and avoiding safety violations. 
Computer vision may take some more time to be fully accepted in the industry, but once its benefits are recognized, this trend will be one of the driving forces of the transport industry. 
6. Fleet Management Programs
Fleet management programs or transport management systems are software tools that bring all the technology used in a fleet business on a single platform. 
This program is where you will find all the data collected by the technology and tools to process them. The trend is useful for implementing new fleet strategies for optimum efficiency.
Transport management is already being used for route optimization, carrier management, digital record management, and more. But the program is constantly evolving to add new functions. 
Suffice it to say that these systems are here to stay and will soon be adopted by both small and big fleet and logistics companies. 
Conclusion
All the trends in the transport industry, right from the well-knowngps definitionto the latest computer vision, are meant to improve processes and simplify transactions.
The trends mentioned above are fast changing the industry with their capabilities and enabling businesses to provide their employees with a safe transit that they deserve.
Fleet managers and fleet businesses can now invest in technology and achieve complicated tasks like accident management, warehouse management, and route planning without human intervention. 
The best part is, all the tech and gadgets can be customized to scale, and every company, no matter its size, can take advantage of the up and coming trends in the industry.

As interest in electric buses in Australia grows – despite the best efforts of the federal government to act like an Emu and bury its head in the sand – it’s worth looking at what is happening overseas, and China in particular.
The EV video website “Fully Charged” has recently produced this episode. Fully Charged: Electric buses in Shenzen.  And despite the less than fully professional presentation, the access granted was so good that inevitably some useful information slipped through the cracks.
The first thing that struck me was the use of English in the wall-length computer dashboard.
So for facts and figures there are, for instance, 16,000 electric buses in Shenzen and the franchise the reporter visited had 6,000, of which 5,938 were in operation at that point in time with 181 depots and 2,000 chargers.
Those 6,000 buses do a total of more than 1 million kilometres per day or, say, 180km each. Buses are recharged from 50% capacity using 150KWh chargers.
The bus has a 250-330KWh battery and the recharging depots are integrated to provide restaurants, etc, while the bus recharges.
The depot’s network essentially had to be rebuilt from scratch to optimise for electric. Daily energy consumption by the bus network appears to be .95GWh You can also get that number by using 93kWh/100 km and 1 million km a day, for the fleet. 93KWh/100km compares with, say, 15-19 for electric cars.
For this fleet, alone, that’s 0.35TWh per year. I believe the terrain in Shenzen to reasonably flat and I read a couple of years back that BYD buses had struggled in San Francisco.
For this franchise it was basically a 10-year program to move to fully electric buses and taxis.
Taxi depots were organised similarly. Taxis in this franchise do a cumulative 0.5 million kilometres per day.
So working off, say, 19kWh per 100km, that’s another 35GWh per year. On these numbers, electric vehicles in Shenzen appear already to be consuming a meaningful share of total electricity in China.
Electric vehicles increase thermal energy consumption in China today
I dislike visiting this old and essentially misleading chestnut, but so long as China has 70% of its power coming from thermal generation, then for that long electrification of transport and industrial processes will increase thermal electricity consumption.
Of course as we, the citizens of the world, decarbonise electricity supply, so it is that electric vehicles make a net positive contribution.
The point is, the two have to go hand in hand. And that brings us to:
China’s electricity consumption is growing
So is coal consumption. Wind and solar are growing quickly but are still at less than half the level as a share of total supply. The numbers below are calendar years.
Figure 2 Source: National Bureau of Statistics, CAGR = Cumulative average growth rate
You can slice and dice these numbers in a few ways.
If you want to be an optimist I suppose you could say that of the increase in electricity production between 2015 and 2020 only 2/3 is from thermal.
However at 1525TWh, the increase alone is equal to, say, 7.5X Australian total consumption from all sources and so it’s a lot of coal, arguably more than China can produce from its own resources.
Shenzen electric transport is already at around 1TWh per year
Shenzen has electrified its public transport. The next step will be to electrify other government-owned transport (garbage services, police, construction machinery and so on). In the process, it’s increased regional electricity consumption by about 1TWh per year, modest in the bigger scheme of things.
Shenzen sets a fine example for Australia
In a capitalist, market-based economy, government policy shouldn’t matter so much. The fact is that Australia has excellent opportunities in electric vehicles; opportunities to increase energy security by reducing oil dependency,opportunities to develop 21st century industries like battery and car technology, opportunities to reduce carbon emissions, opportunities to create a better lifestyle for Australians, opportunities to shift from one form of resource extraction, coal, to another, lithium, and to enhance our world position in rare earths, copper, aluminium and nickel.
The Shenzen example shows that strong public commitment is required to manage transition of bus and taxi fleets. The system needs to be planned, depots reconfigured, shifts reorganised, and a comprehensive charging network established with an eye to future technology.
In regard to all of this, Australia’s federal government leadership is completely lacking. “Have a go” seems to belong to another era.
Federal cabinet is comprised of people with good academic credentials, including Angus Taylor, but their ability seems to be used for anything but the good of Australia’s people, present and future. That only serves to reinforce the increasing cynicism people have towards leaders who waste their own and everyone else’s time.
Burying your head in the sand is an Australian metaphor. Rarely has it seemed more apt.

The German government is drafting legislation to permit the use of Level Four autonomous driving technology on public roads, according to the country’s Minister for Transport and Digital Infrastructure Andreas Scheuer.
As laid out in our guide to self-driving cars, Level Four autonomy denotes the capability to safely navigate almost any on-road circumstance without the need for any driver intervention.
In an official statement posted online, Minister Scheuer said: “Germany will be the first country in the world to bring autonomous vehicles from its research laboratories onto the road.
“I am very pleased that the cabinet has cleared the way for our law on autonomous driving … The German government aims to bring the laws into regular operation by 2022, meaning that within 12 months there could be driverless cars operating,” he added.
However, such technology – at least initially – will reportedly be restricted to certain vehicles travelling in predetermined “zones.”
Toby Walsh, Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of New South Wales, told CarAdvice the decision is not without risk, but ultimately represents a step in the right direction. 
“Driving itself is already a very dangerous activity – people die on the roads every single day but eventually, because of autonomous cars, that hopefully won’t happen as much. We just need to find the best and safest way to roll out the technology, and the Germans – being German – have been very pragmatic about it.”
As for the future of the technology in Australia, Mr Walsh wasn’t holding his breath: “Just like with electric cars, we’re way behind the curve here.”
“Personally, I can’t wait for them to arrive. I hate driving, I think it’s a waste of time, and it’s dangerous,” he added.

 Optimising the transport system in terms of traffic flow, commutability and safety in these tightly-packed spaces have become a key concern for the public and private sectors – with climate change also prompting an urgent rethink of urban transportation. So, what will the future of urban mobility look like? 
Bosch notes that, by the end of 2020, around 70% of the global population will dwell in cities. These urban environments, which are already bursting at the seams, will struggle to operate as the number of people entering them increases. Here are five of the key trends, which we anticipate will shape the future of urban mobility. The future of urban mobility: key trends for 2021
Autonomous vehicles
Speaking about the future of urban mobility, autonomous vehicles are among the first trends to come to one’s mind. The driverless vehicle, or AV, market is currently valued at approximately $54 billion. That’s set to increase tenfold within the next decade, as technologies that enable automated car manufacture become more sophisticated and readily available.
Currently, there are around 1,500 self-driving cars on the road in the US but, with big automakers including Toyota, Honda, BMW and Renault ploughing investment into driverless functionality, the market is set to boom. German automotive behemoth, Audi, has plans to invest around $16 billion in its autonomous vehicles by 2030.
There are five levels of automation, from level 1, which offers some of the driver assist functionality we already see on the roads, to 5 which will, eventually, offer a fully autonomous “robot vehicle” – taking complete control of the driver’s seat. The levels breakdown as follows:
Level 1: Driver assistance – the vehicle is controlled by the driver but offers some driver-assist functionality.Level 2: Partial automation – the vehicle requires the driver to remain engaged behind the wheel but offers some combined automated functions, including acceleration and steering.Level 3: Conditional automation – the vehicle is able to monitor the environment but the driver must be ready to take control in a split second.Level 4: High automation – the vehicle can perform all driver functions, depending on certain conditions, and the driver has the option to take over.Level 5: Full automation – the vehicle can perform all driver functions in every type of environment/condition, but the driver has the option to take charge of the wheel if they wish.
Some of the key benefits of driverless technology include:
Reduction in accidents – According to the United States Department of Transportation, human error accounts for 94% of road traffic accidents. By eliminating human error, billions of dollars worth of accident and fatality payments could be saved, productivity within the workplace increased and the social burden of living with injury/coping with loss, eased.Smoother traffic flow through congested areas – autonomous vehicles can facilitate better road cooperation in heavy traffic, allowing drivers to save hours spent in traffic jams and, thus, spend more time at home with their families.Enabling social independence – millions of people across the globe live either physically isolated or isolated by a disability and, in many cases, the key to them living independently is the ability to drive. With vehicle autonomy, many millions more will have access to employment and social interaction which may have otherwise been denied them.
E-mobility
The climate crisis has highlighted the poor and, in some cases, illegal air quality in many of the world’s large cities. Today, there are around 500 “megacities” – some with over 20 million inhabitants consuming around 70% of the world’s energy resources. The rail, subway and road networks servicing these metropolises are no longer adequate to support their expanding populations. According to a study by the UK’s Office of National Statistics, around a fifth of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions came from road transport in 2017 – up 6% since 1990. So the problem needs to be tackled at household level.
Modern internal-combustion engines have come a long way since their first iterations. They are far less polluting but don’t offer a complete solution for better air quality. Vehicle electrification, however, does.
In the Netherlands and, particularly, Amsterdam, inhabitants are experiencing better air quality due to the rapid installation of e-car infrastructure, to support an urban transition to electric transportation. The city has gone so far as to build individual e-car charge points, in instances where e-vehicle owners don’t have their own readily equipped parking spot. And across the Netherlands, Statista recorded almost 41,000 electric charge points for vehicles, as of 2019.
In China, there are currently around 330,000 charge points for electric vehicles and growing, with the country now producing almost 60% of the world’s “new energy vehicles”. Electromobility is no longer a fringe technology. It will fundamentally alter urban mobility in the near future.
Mobility as a Service
Our urban landscapes no longer favour the pedestrian, they’ve been carved up by major road routes and congested with lanes of pollution-emitting traffic. The leaders of the world’s major cities want to see their streets repurposed to support a better quality of life and cleaner air – where previously gridlocked streets could be pedestrianised and turned into much-needed living space, equipped with bike lanes, shops, restaurants and parks.
This has sparked an upsurge in innovative businesses investing in Mobility as a Service (MaaS). This includes bike and car-share schemes, taxi services and vehicle rental, offering a consumer-centric approach to urban mobility. MaaS is an on-demand plaform which uses Big Data and open-source data to offer a real-time consolidated view of different transport options, as well as simplified route planning and payment. 
Sweden’s UbiGo launched in 2019, pioneering an app which shows all public transport, car-share, taxi and car rental services available to the user, then offers them a mobility subscription service to pay for their journeys. The model was so successful in Stockholm that it has now been rolled out in Gothenburg.
By simplifying the method of finding and paying for transportation on-demand, using big data and two-way communication while continually seeking and implementing user feedback, MaaS solutions could replace individual car ownership for those living in cities.
Micromobility
Reinforcing the lean toward MaaS solutions to free-up valuable street space, a plethora of innovative companies are developing personal mobility devices and light electric vehicles for the masses, which take up far less square-footage than traditional motor vehicles. Technological advances have allowed manufacturers to shrink electric motors and compact their batteries to develop e-scooters and EVs which tackle the double threat of pollution and congestion.
In San Fransisco in 2018, startup company Bird deployed a fleet of electric scooters onto city streets, with unprecedented uptake. Fast-forward to 2020 and, according to a report by Europe’s MotorCycles Data, the electric two-wheeler market has leapt by 11% in the first nine months of this year. Sales of e-scooters hit 75,000 across 28 continental countries (including the UK), jumping by a straggering 36.6% in the third quarter of the year.
Demand has been boosted by COVID-19, which has deterred many people from using public transport to get from A to B. Now, it seems that personal mobility devices are here to stay, with the public sector needing to come up with robust policies on where they can/should be ridden and where to store them safely when not in use.
And, where individuals need a mobility option that allows them to carry more than just themselves, light electric vehicles offer a compact footprint for ideal use in urban environments, while still offering the functionality of a car.
Shared mobility
We’ve briefly touched on vehicle sharing already, but shared mobility across all modes – carsharing, ride-hailing scooter or bike-sharing services – could dramatically improve our urban landscapes and air quality. There has been a huge increase in companies offering these kinds of services in recent years – Uber, Drive Now, Zipcar, etc. – made easier by the proliferation of data.
Now, big OEM players including Toyota, General Motors, Daimler AG and BMW Group have launched their own carsharing services. And the offering is becoming increasingly flexible too, with companies providing various options including round-trip and free-floating services, with evermore complex pricing plans.
Shared mobility services, implemented as a city-wide framework, can provide people with convenient, door-to-door transportation for a price that’s comparable to public transport, while negating the need for individual car ownership. This, in turn, creates more space for public facilities, leads to better air quality and reduces the burden on natural resources.
Conclusion
As we grapple with the unstoppable growth of our cities and the climatic and social implications of such spaces, innovative businesses must collaborate with the public sector in order to reimagine the future of urban mobility. The wealth of Big and open-source data available now can provide flexible public and private transport solutions that reduce the need for standard, pollution-emitting personal vehicles and outdated, difficult/expensive to maintain rail and subway networks.
There is no one-size-fits-all model, however. Each city must really evaluate its current state vs what its residents need, in order to come up with the urban mobility solution that best fits its population.

AS more Malaysians live in urban areas, cities are starting to face pain points such as congestion, pollution and inefficient deployment of urban services.
Building smart cities is seen as a solution that addresses these issues and improves the quality of life of urban dwellers.
In September last year, then Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad launched Malaysia Smart City Framework. He said it is important to turn Malaysia into a “smart city” and it is among the items of priority under the 12th Malaysia Plan (12th MP).
Arkitek Mustapha Kamal Sdn Bhd principal Mustapha Kamal Zulkarnain says it is a great effort and a good paper (framework) prepared.
“I would certainly hope that the full acronym of SMART (which stands for System, Monitor, Analysis, Reconfigure and Thinking (re-think)) is being implemented and used in our cities to be more meaningful. It should not be just lip service,” he tells FocusM.
Smart city initiatives are also part of the actions of the National Physical Plan 3 which is aimed at expanding and enhancing digital infrastructure, strengthening and expanding broadband coverage, and strengthening the provision of infrastructure facilities and services for smart city initiatives.
Internet of Things (IoT) firm Senzo Malaysia Sdn Bhd chief technology officer Dr Muhammad Imran Sarwar tells FocusM that Kuala Lumpur, Johor and Penang are on the path of becoming smart cities, but they still have a long way to go.
“The smart city initiative should have focused on sustainable energy management, security, autonomous vehicles and public safety.
“From a technological perspective, the launch of 5G will enable smart cities along with IoT, big data analytics and cybersecurity,” he said.
However, slow economic growth in the region, cost of infrastructure and old mindsets are the hurdles of making a smart city, says Muhammad Imran.
“The government should be a bridge between the industry and academia and make smart cities an important agenda for a sustainable tomorrow.”
Smart cities need strategic planning
In planning for smart cities, Mustapha says governments and developers need to understand the preliminary objective of how to implement smart cities and how they can solve the problems in the cities.
“Yes, it would help to boost the government agenda. It should transcend to Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Cyberjaya as they are part of the Multimedia Super Corridor in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
“We have all the ingredients like manpower, knowledgeable technologists, a learning scientific community, and governance from the government,” Mustapha says.
According to him, what is lacking is the belief, trust and commitment by the financial communities to realise the importance of this in order to be at the forefront of economics and technology in the very near future.
“The belief, trust and importance placed by the financial community are to support all these initiatives to fruition. Another is the short-term thinking of this being a long gestation period to return your investments.
“With such participation, we can collectively imagine, examine, choose and shape the future of our cities,” he says.
Mustapha further adds that a smart city is a convergence of big data, connectivity and artificial intelligence (AI) towards a “precision city”.
Meanwhile, Muhammad Imran says the government’s role is to create the policy and framework for a smart city. Moreover, it should encourage different relevant ministries to work together.
“Government should also give tax incentives and research and development funds to the industry and academia so they can develop all the components of a smart city locally.”
Why we need smart cities
Mustapha shares the primary goal of a smart city is to create an urban environment that yields a high quality of life to its residents while also generating overall economic growth.
“Therefore, a major advantage of smart cities is their ability to facilitate an increased delivery of services to citizens with less infrastructure and cost.
“As the population within cities continues to grow, it becomes necessary for these urban areas to accommodate the increasing population by making more efficient use of their infrastructure and assets,” he says.
Smart city applications can enable these improvements, advance city operations and improve the quality of life among residents as well as find and create new value from their existing infrastructure.
Smart city technology
Smart cities use a combination of IoT devices, software solutions, user interfaces (UI) and communication networks.
However, they rely first and foremost on the IoT. The IoT is a network of connected devices – such as vehicles, sensors or home appliances – that can communicate and exchange data.
Data collected and delivered by the IoT sensors and devices are stored in the cloud or on servers.
The connection of these devices and use of data analytics facilitate the convergence of the physical and digital city elements, thus improving both public and private sectors’ efficiency, enabling economic benefits and improving citizens’ lives.
The IoT devices sometimes have processing capabilities called edge computing. Edge computing ensures that only the most important and relevant information is communicated over the communication network.
Features of a smart city
Mustapha notes that emerging trends such as automation, machine learning and the IoT are driving smart city adoption.
Theoretically, any area of city management can be incorporated into a smart city initiative, he says. A classic example is the smart parking meter that uses an application to help drivers find available parking spaces without prolonged circling of crowded city blocks.
The smart meter also enables digital payment, so there’s no risk of coming up short of coins for the meter.
Also in the transportation arena, smart traffic management is used to monitor and analyse traffic flows in order to optimise streetlights and prevent roadways from becoming too congested based on the time of day.
Smart public transit is another facet of smart cities, used to ensure public transportation meets user demand. Smart transit companies are able to coordinate services and fulfil riders’ needs in real time, improving efficiency and rider satisfaction.
It is not a big hoo-ha that nowadays people prefer to live and work in a smart area which has a seamless connection dubbed the transit-oriented development (TOD). It is a mixed-use residential and commercial area designed to maximise access to public transport, and often incorporates features to encourage transit ridership.
Energy conservation and efficiency are major focuses of smart cities. Using smart sensors, smart streetlights dim when there aren’t cars or pedestrians on the roadways. Smart grid technology can be used to improve operations, maintenance and planning, and to supply power on demand and monitor energy outages.
Smart city initiatives also aim to monitor and address environmental concerns such as climate change and air pollution.
Waste management and sanitation can also be improved with smart technology, be it using internet-connected trash cans and IoT-enabled fleet management systems for waste collection and removal, or using sensors to measure water parameters and guarantee the quality of drinking water at the front end of the system, with proper wastewater removal and drainage at the back end.
Smart city technology is increasingly being used to improve public safety, from monitoring areas of high crime to improve emergency preparedness with sensors. For example, smart sensors can be critical components of an early warning system before droughts, floods, landslides or hurricanes.
How smart city works
Mustapha says smart cities utilise their web of connected IoT devices and other technologies to achieve their goals of improving the quality of life and achieving economic growth. Successful smart cities follow four steps:
1. Collection – Smart sensors throughout the city gather data in real time.2. Analysis – Data collected by the smart sensors are assessed in order to draw meaningful insights.3. Communication – The insights that have been found in the analysis phase are communicated with decision makers through strong communication networks.4. Action – Cities use the insights pulled from the data to create solutions, optimise operations and asset management and improve the quality of life for residents.
Fostering sustainability
Sustainability is another major facet of smart cities. Urbanisation is expected to increase even more in the coming years.
The United Nations reported that around 55% of the world’s population currently resides in an urban area or city; this figure is set to rise 68% throughout the coming decades.
Smart technology will help cities sustain growth and improve efficiency for citizen welfare and government efficiency in urban areas in the years to come.
Making the switch to an electric public transportation system would not only decrease fuel emissions, but could also pose the advantage of working closely with the city’s electric power infrastructure in order to minimise the impact of charging batteries during peak hours of electric use.
Furthermore, with proper coordination, electric vehicles could also be used to regulate the frequency of the city’s electric grid when they’re not in service.
The number of cars used in cities is also expected to decrease as municipalities become smarter. Autonomous vehicles, or self-driving cars, could potentially change a population’s perspective on the necessity of owning cars.
Smart city challenges and concerns
According to Muhammad Imran, the current situation, the global meltdown of the economy especially due to coronavirus and the fragile nature of oil prices are some of the key challenges faced.
“Innovative and design thinking should be promoted to create technology and its ecosystem in Malaysia as the supply chain is already there. Moreover, the emphasis of internet protocol towards the smart city eco-system should be created. We should need to think big but start small,” he says.
Nevertheless, Mustapha says smart city initiatives must include the people they aim to help – residents, business, people and visitors.
“The government must not only raise awareness of the benefits of the smart city technologies being implemented, but also promote the use of open, democratised data to its citizens.
“If people know what they are participating in and the benefits it can bring, they are more likely to engage,” he says.
Therefore, fostering collaboration between the public and private sectors and city residents is key to creating smart citizens who will be engaged and empowered and positively contribute to the city and community.
According to Mustapha, new and innovative collaboration methods can improve engagement.
Smart city projects should include plans to make the data transparent and available to citizens, often through an open data portal or mobile app. This enables residents to engage with the data and understand what it is used for.
He said residents may use a smart city app to be able to complete personal chores, such as viewing their home’s energy consumption, paying bills and finding efficient public transportation.
The presence of sensors and cameras may be perceived as an invasion of privacy or government surveillance. To address this, smart city data collected should be anonymised and not be personally identifiable information.
The thousands or millions of IoT devices scattered across the city would be defunct without a solid connection, and the smart city itself would be dead.
Furthermore, Mustapha says public transit, traffic management, public safety, water and waste management, electricity and natural gas supply can be unreliable, especially as a system ages and grows.
However, the importance of these operations will only increase as the city expands and the demands on its infrastructure increase. These systems must be constantly maintained and tested to ensure their proper functioning.
What is a smart city?
In the last several years, there has been an explosive growth of information and communications technologies (ICTs) due to the advancement of hardware and software designs.
Arkitek Mustapha Kamal Sdn Bhd principal Mustapha Kamal Zulkarnain says explains that the use of ICT in cities in various forms for different activities has led to the increased effectiveness of city operations, and these cities have been labelled using many terms such as “cyberville,” “digital city,” “electronic city,” “flexicity,” “information city,” “telicity,” “wired city” and “smart city.”
“Smart city” is the largest abstraction among the labels used, as it encompasses other labels used for cities.
Characteristics
According to Mustapha, there are nine major characteristics used to determine a city’s smartness. They include a technology-based infrastructure, environmental initiatives, a high-functioning public transportation system, a confident sense of urban planning, and humans to live and work within the city and utilise its resources.
A smart city’s success depends on its ability to form a strong relationship between the government – including its bureaucracy and regulations – and the private sector.
This relationship is necessary because most of the work that is done to create and maintain a digital, data-driven environment occurs outside of the government. Surveillance equipment for busy streets could include sensors from one company, cameras from another and a server from yet another.
According to a news report dated Jan 20, Local Government Minister Zuraida Kamaruddin was quoted saying that Pengerang in Johor has been targeted to become a smart city in five years.

At the moment there is much speculation and uncertainty about what America’s major metropolitan regions will look like. As the nation finally emerges from its current public health crisis and the economic hardships that have resulted from the responses to it, questions abound about the future of work, place, and transportation.
One thing is clear: the future of the nation’s major cities is interwoven with the transportation systems that serve them. This is particularly true for the transit networks and providers that make the economies of dense central business districts (CBD) possible As Harvard economist Edward Glaeser has noted, transportation technologies have shaped cities.
In the last 20 or 30 years America’s major metropolitan regions—and their CBDs—have become the engines of the nation’s economic growth. These urban centers are characterized by technological innovation, diversity, and knowledge-based financial and professional services. They are generally the locations of leading health, educational, and cultural institutions.
 In 2018, more than half of the U.S. population lived in metropolitan regions of over one million, and just the ten largest have a combined economic output great than every other country on the planet, except China, according to the U.S. Conference of Mayors. The Economist recently noted that workers who live in the nation’s largest metropolitan regions are 50 percent more productive than those who live in smaller metros.
Moreover, the existence of reliable transportation services that provide mobility and accessibility to CBDs have been perquisites for, and closely related to, the transformation of these urban areas and their economic growth and significance. Nicole Gelinas of the Manhattan Institute wrote recently, “Subways, buses and commuter rail make up the physical infrastructure that enables urban life. . . . A big part of what makes cities attractive is street life, which is incompatible with suburban-style car dependency.”
Eight months into the pandemic, the white-collar workforce of major metro CBDs are only a fraction of pre-COVID-19 levels and, importantly, the restaurants, hotels, and retail stores that serve them are operating at much reduced levels. Many have been forced to close permanently. Theaters and other downtown cultural and recreational venues are similarly closed.
Not surprisingly, the transit systems that serve city centers are under severe financial strain in the face of precipitous ridership and revenue declines. The challenge is that CBDs cannot survive without transit, and transit systems cannot survive without riders, unless there are massive and continuing operating subsidies from the general funds of cities or states, themselves facing daunting deficits, or from the federal government.
There are those who believe that major cities will bounce back once there is a vaccine and/or effective treatments for COVID-19, as New York City did after 9/11. However, this time seems different, perhaps because the public health and related economic crises revealed several key trends already in place:
For one, the pandemic has dramatically demonstrated the wide economic inequalities within the nation’s major metropolitan regions and the social isolation of many lower-income communities. Prosperity, opportunity, and access that seem to characterize these urbanized regions are not equitably shared.
We also learned that much office work can be accomplished remotely, especially if you are white and college-educated. Telecommuting and working from home was growing before the pandemic, and many firms have learned through this experience that their need for downtown office space can be reduced, perhaps sharply. This suggests that hotel, restaurant, and retail uses that serve downtown office workers may be overbuilt.
Similarly, escalating costs and limited supplies of housing in urban and close-in suburban areas of major metropolitan regions has already led to the outmigration of people. In places like Boston, New York, Seattle, and San Francisco this means those who cannot, or are unable to work from home, are seeing longer and longer home to work commutes.
And the decline in brick-and-mortar retail and the growth of online shopping has greatly accelerated by the pandemic. In fact, e-tail shopping is so strong, it will more than make up for the drop in traditional business that has a physical store.
All of these land use and economic trends, if maintained, will have significant implications for transportation services (not limited to transit) and should influence transportation capital planning, design, and investment decision-making.
Overall, America’s major or “star” metropolitan regions are likely to remain the drivers of the nation’s economic and population growth and centers of innovation and diversity in a post-pandemic world. However, these major metropolitan regions and the various activities and land uses within them are likely to become more decentralized.  That means that metropolitan transportation services and facilities will have to provide the mobility, access, and opportunity in different ways.
Transit services are going to have to become more innovative, flexible, and customer-driven, even as reduced ridership and/or new practices will demand continuing and significant public operating subsidies. Effective, reliable, and available transit must become an essential element in overcoming inequality and isolation for disadvantaged communities and residents of metropolitan regions. To enable those reforms and to enhance service, greater cooperation between the public and private sectors will be required.
Finally, more decentralized metropolitan regions and more remote office uses (whether through greater work-at-home or satellite offices in less dense areas) and concerns about health safety on public transit and commuter rail could well mean an increase in auto-mobility within metropolitan regions. If so, we must be certain that greater use of motor vehicles (including trucking, related to changes in retail and more home deliveries) cannot translate into increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector. A mix of fuel efficiency and emissions regulation and pricing (whether mileage-based fees or carbon taxes) must accompany these changes in metropolitan economies and land uses.
Just as we cannot predict the post-pandemic future of office and related commercial uses, we cannot be certain of the nature of the transportation demands and facilities that will be necessary to enable and support those economic and social changes, and the altered urban growth patterns that are likely to emerge. However, innovation and flexibility will have to be essential characteristics of transportation planners, engineers, and executives, as the nation emerges from its public health and economic crises.

 More roads and lanes are simply not the solution to ever-increasing traffic woes. 
By  Beth Osborne 
If you ask the average person how to solve traffic congestion, a large majority would say widen the roads and add more lanes.
This response seems intuitive, but it’s misguided. That’s because of “induced demand” — a phenomenon when the supply of a good increases, more of that same good is consumed — ultimately leading to greater use of our roadways.
Yet we’ve all seen it happen — widen a road, and new traffic materializes to fill it right back up. In fact, a recent academic study from California State University showed that every 1% increase in road capacity guarantees a 1% increase in vehicle miles traveled.
Hawaii’s strategy for solving traffic congestion fits the definition of insanity. Recent mandated work-from-home scenarios aside, the state has been doing the same thing over and over again for decades while expecting a different result.
Hawaii’s residents and elected leaders have been conned to believe that more roads and lanes are the solution to ever-increasing traffic congestion. And it’s been incredibly expensive.
A Losing Strategy
Every year, local media report how bad congestion is on Oahu. The average Oahu driver spends 64 hours in congestion each year, according to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute’s 2019 Urban Mobility Report. Unfortunately, the state has been spending vast sums of money on a strategy that promises relief, but only makes it worse.
As American historian and philosopher of technology Lewis Mumford bluntly put it, “Building more roads to prevent congestion is like a fat man loosening his belt to prevent obesity.”
That’s precisely what Hawaii has done. Between 1993 and 2017, Honolulu’s population increased by 23% while lane-miles increased by 8%. Congestion, however, spiked by a disproportionate 166%.
Hawaii’s strategy for solving traffic congestion fits the definition of insanity.
Perhaps Hawaii just didn’t build enough new road capacity to keep up with population growth? Scores of other metro areas tried that particular strategy, and they failed as well. Adding more lanes faster than population also fails to reduce congestion, as shown in The Congestion Con, a report released by Transportation for America earlier this year.
Between 1993 and 2017, the nation’s 100 largest urbanized areas added 30,511 new freeway lane-miles in these areas, an increase of 42% — which is greater than the 32% growth in population in those regions over the same time period. Still, delay and congestion exploded by 144%.
At The Expense Of Basic Repair
All of this new roadway capacity is coming at the expense of basic repair, which poll after poll shows is where most voters want transportation agencies to focus their resources.
In 2017, 42% of Hawaii’s roads were in poor condition — only California and Rhode Island had a larger share in poor condition. Nevertheless, Hawaii still spent more on expanding roads than repairing existing ones: $86 million per year on average spent on road expansion between 2009 and 2014 versus $82 million spent on road repair each year on average.
Each new road is more properly considered a liability, not an asset. Every time Hawaii chooses to neglect a repair project in favor of building a new road or widening an existing one, Hawaii increases the amount of funding required to maintain the system.
Every new road brings decades of maintenance costs that are almost never accounted for. According to Federal Highway Administration data and Transportation for America’s analysis, it costs about $24,000 per lane-mile per year to keep a good road in “good” condition. (Those costs are likely higher in Hawaii).
These enormous “investments” might have been worth it if congestion were being reduced. But that’s the con — it isn’t.
Growth in freeway lane-miles and population growth in the largest 100 U.S. urbanized areas from 1993 to 2017.
Transportation for America
In fact, in all 100 regions, not one region saw its congestion go down or even hold steady. This remains true across all population scenarios, whether population increased faster, slower, declined, or at the same pace. It didn’t matter — they all had increases in congestion.
Transportation for America isn’t the only one reporting this kind of data. Take the Hawaii Department of Transportation’s word for it. Hawaii’s current Fiscal Biennium 2019-2021 Operating and Capital Budget forecasts an 11% increase in vehicle miles traveled by 2024. The department is essentially saying that if we implement its program, more people will drive more. Given Hawaii’s climate commitments, this is a step in the wrong direction.
So what does address congestion and delay?
As the state looks ahead and identifies short- and long-term recovery spending, we would be wise to consider the following:
Stop inducing demand through futile expansion of road capacity. More lane-miles means more incentives to drive more, which will only increase the congestion.Continue to shift state and county land-use and transportation policies away from enabling auto dominance. In decision-making, prioritize moving people, not vehicles.Likewise, design public streets for moving people, not vehicles. Employ “quick build” approaches using flexible, low-cost installation materials, such as paint and moveable barriers to support walking, biking and transit to expedite results.Expose the hidden costs of parking and driving for users. Stop forcing non-drivers to financially support drivers.Invest dramatically in the increased capacity and funding of active modes. This means not just a project here and there, but building the technical support and funding to match our desired community goals around active transportation.
It’s time for Hawaii to stop spending money it doesn’t have to build roads that it doesn’t need, while failing to provide the core function of getting people to jobs and services each day by any mode necessary. It’s time to stop falling for the congestion con.

The findings of a freight data sharing study, which involved trials with companies including Woolworths, Nestle and Toll Group, has outlined the opportunities for improvement in the sector, as well as identifying why supply chains are suffering.
The iMOVE Cooperative Research Centre study undertaken with the Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE) and GS1 Australia recently released its report, the findings of which will assist the Australian Government in setting up the National Freight Data Hub (NFDH).
The NFDH will collect and aggregate data to:
Give visibility to how the freight network is performingImprove infrastructure and transport network planningSupport operations through aligned data standards and provided timely insights into issues and bottlenecks
The iMOVE/BITRE study sought to test specific use cases to get a deeper insight into these issues and give the NFDH a head start in addressing freight supply chain problems faced by industry.
The study involved three parts: two pilot trials with industry operators including Nestle, Woolworths, Toll, and Infrabuild; and a third pilot working with global business communications standards giant and barcode inventor GS1 Australia dealing with data aggregation.
The data aggregation project involved creating methods and systems to collect and convert raw freight consignment message data into strategic-level data  ie. producing insightful information for governments and industry that can be used for infrastructure planning and policy development.
Using GS1’s electronic interchange systems, the data aggregation pilot was highly successful in showing the benefits that can be gained.
Importantly, it illustrated how aggregated (‘strategic-level’) outputs can be derived from raw freight consignment messages. These include freight volumes by mode and commodity for specified time periods; supply chain-specific freight volume metrics; and supply-chain and network performance metrics (e.g. travel times, and estimated arrival times etc.)
A statement from the report said that the data aggregation project results “demonstrate how operational data can be transformed into strategic data that can help inform infrastructure planning, network operations, corridor planning and freight policy”.
The pilot trials including Nestle, Woolworths, Toll, and Infrabuild sought to identify matching unique consignment information across partner supply chain management systems, and see how this could be shared on different systems in real-time.
Although the trials were cut short by COVID-19, the early findings revealed that real-time freight consignment data is not currently shared across the supply chain and supply chain operators’ noted this impacted their ability to respond to disruptions.
The report said, “The multiplicity of standards and systems in use across industry, made it very difficult for project participants to reconcile and match related consignment records across the different systems”.
The study uncovered, in some cases, the unavailability of useful information about freight consignments once they left the dispatch bay, with paper-based systems still widely used.
“As a result, the shipper typically had no visibility of delayed or late shipments, until queried by the customer, impacting the ability to respond to unanticipated disruptions in a timely and efficient manner,” the report stated.
“The inability to link information across supply chain partners can result in significant re-keying of the same information multiple times across the supply chain, increasing cost and reducing efficiency.
“Increasing digitalisation can assist improved visibility of freight consignments and interoperability between supply chain partners.
“It can also significantly reduce the administrative burden for small operators. Improved visibility can help improve predictability, efficiency, and productivity of the freight industry, and improve industry responsiveness to supply chain delays, bottlenecks or error.”
iMOVE Managing Director, Ian Christensen, called on industry to take bolder steps to embrace data and increase information sharing along supply chains, or risk being out-competed by overseas operators who are already reaping the efficiency benefits.
“If we don’t lift our game Australian productivity could fall further behind, and our competitiveness will be seriously undermined,” Mr Christensen said.
“Freight operations overseas are working vigorously to reduce ‘transactional friction’ along supply chains. 
“Australian businesses need to catch up and recognise the importance of sharing data to maintain the competitiveness of local supply chains.
“State and Federal governments in Australia are also focussed on achieving stronger supply chain performance. 
“Their interest is in making informed decisions on new infrastructure and better freight policy, and to do that they need a clear view of the overall picture. This is best achieved by aggregating (anonymised) real operational data from the freight industry itself.
“iMOVE wants to find ways for governments and businesses to work together to make this happen.”
In a statement following the report’s release, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, Michael McCormack, said the study will lead to improvements in getting goods to customers by improving access to real-time supply chain freight data.
“The report provides insights for governments and industry for infrastructure planning and delivery,” Mr McCormack said.
“It shows how increasing digitization can improve visibility of freight for supply chain partners to decrease unexpected delivery disruptions.
“The Australian Government has committed $8.5 million to fund projects such as these that are enhancing the collection of freight data across the nation and settle the design of a National Freight Data Hub.”
Assistant Minister for Road Safety and Freight Transport, Scott Buchholz, said the report could open the door to improved productivity and efficiency for the freight industry.
“The report noted sharing real-time freight data would mean our supply chain operators could respond to delays and errors quickly, which will help our truckies do their crucial job getting goods to businesses and consumers,” Mr Buchholz said.
“We want to ensure our freight is moving efficiently across the country, getting to our doors as smoothly as possible.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted more than ever the critical importance of our freight supply chains and all those involved.
“This study has given the Australian Government a deeper insight into ways we can improve our freight supply chains.”

Waymo has partnered with one of the world’s largest truck manufacturers to install its fully autonomous self-driving technology into semi-trailer trucks on American roads.
Daimler is the oldest name in German automotive engineering, and its US-based trucking arm Daimler Trucks said on Tuesday that it’s collaborating with Waymo on its Freightliner Cascadia line of big rigs. Last year, the Euro giant invested in Torc Robotics, a self-driving startup based in Virginia that’s more oriented towards the defense industry than Waymo is.
“In recent years, we have achieved significant progress on our global roadmap to bringing series-produced highly automated trucks to the road,” said Martin Daum, chairman of the board of management of Daimler Truck AG.
“With our strategic partnership with Waymo as the leader in autonomous driving, we are taking another important step towards that goal. This partnership complements Daimler Trucks’ dual strategy approach, of working with two strong partners to deliver autonomous L4 solutions that are seamlessly integrated with our best-in-class trucks, to our customers.”
The partnership aims to build level-four automated trucks, which would use AI to perform all the necessary functions needed to drive autonomously for a whole trip, theoretically. It’ll still need a human driver to take over when necessary, for safety and regulatory reasons.
Neither company announced a strict deadline for when autonomous convoys of trucks expect to hit the roads. Waymo only said its self-driving software would be rolling out to US customers “in the coming years”.
“At Waymo, we’re developing a fully autonomous L4 stack, which means the Waymo Driver is responsible for the entire driving task at all times, with no human required in the loop,” a spokesperson told The Register.
“Our Driver-as-a-Service model will first be focused on highway driving and also handle driving on a limited amount of surface streets to depots, whether that’s an LTL terminal or warehouse or distribution center.” LTL stands for “less-than-truckload shipping” and describes small freight carriers that hold over 150lb (68kg) of goods.
The Alphabet-owned Google spin-off has entered into multiple partnerships with automakers, mostly dealing with smaller cars rather than trucks. It has been testing its self-driving software in trucks for a while, however. Waymo has been testing bulkier delivery trucks in highways across California, Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico since 2017.

While 2020 was a successful year for Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically the subfields of Machine Learning (ML) that are Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning, there is one industry that is on the cusp of mass market adoption and that is autonomous vehicles.
While Tesla’s autopilot was first introduced in September 2014, it still does not qualify for full level 5 autonomous driving. Level 5 is defined as Full Driving Automation. Level 4 is defined as High Driving Automation, and the current version of Tesla autopilot would best be defined as Level 3 Conditional Driving Automation. This still requires the human to be alert to take control of the vehicle.
2020 Milestones
2020 was a hugely positive year for autonomous vehicles, since October 2020 Waymo has been enabling customers to hail driverless vehicles using a service called WAYMO ONE, and the feedback from riders has been overwhelmingly positive. There have been no reported incidents of dangerous driving, or even of strange errors.  To be specific WAYMO ONE is full level 5 autonomous driving. This service enables anyone in Metro Pheonix to download the Waymo App and hail a ride. This is no different than riding in an Uber or Lyft, with the primary difference being that there is no driver, and specifically there is no safety driver to take over should there be an issue.
Unlike Tesla, Waymo does take advantage of Lidar technology. The benefits of Lidar is it offers a 95 degree field of view versus traditional cameras that offer a 30 degree field of view. The downsides of Lidar is that it is more expensive than traditional cameras. Similar to any other new technology the more mass market adoption the more the cost of Lidar will drop due to economies of scale.
While Waymo has successfully deployed one of the first driverless ride sharing networks, other companies have also made significant progress in 2020 including Alibaba’s AutoX. This December they reported for the first time that the fleet of 25 autonomous vehicles in China’s Shenzhen city have no  accompanying safety drivers. Also reported were plans to within six months expand to 10 cities globally.
Another important milestone is Amazon purchasing Zoox for $1.2 billion earlier in 2020. Amazon stated that the two companies will work together to design autonomous ride-hailing vehicles from the ground up by prioritizing passengers’ needs first.
2021 Industry Projections
The news for 2021 is showing promise on the autonomous vehicle front, some major news includes Walmart announcing the start of truly driverless operations in their hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas beginning in 2021. This is after they had previously driven 70,000 operational miles in autonomous mode with a safety driver. To begin they plan on a driverless fleet on a specific route in Arkansas, and will then expand operations to a second location in Louisiana. It doesn’t take much forward thinking to realize that this will soon expand to the rest of the country, with the only probable hold back being local state and city regulations.
More important for mass market adoption has been the announcement that Tesla will release its ‘full self-driving’ feature as a subscription in early 2021.  The full self driving is still a very early beta that allows drivers to automatically handle city streets, traffic lights, roundabouts and street turns. From our impression it is a level 4 (High Driving Automation) technology that is close to level 5 (full driving automation).
Another example of a potential entrant in the space is GreenPower Motor Company Inc,  a leading manufacturer and distributor of zero emissions electric powered medium and heavy duty vehicles. They recently announced the delivery of the first fully autonomous EV Star to Jacksonville Transportation Authority (JTA) in collaboration with Perrone Robotics. Driving is slated to commence in early 2021.
Dangers of Level 4
Without a doubt driverless vehicles are far safer than human driven vehicles. Statistically speaking having a vehicle engaged on autopilot results in collisions at a far lower incidence than human operators. Tesla Autopilot Accidents are reported to be 1 out of 4,530,000 Miles driven; versus the US accidents Average: 1 out of 479,000 Miles driven.
Since autonomous vehicles use deep reinforcement learning and other proprietary machine learning technologies, the more miles driven, the more data that is collected and the more that the algorithm improves itself. Unlike humans who only learn from their own personal past experience, a Tesla is always learning. A Tesla may learn a new edge case in Wyoming, and apply the logic from that learned experience to a new encounter in Delaware. In other words, the more Teslas on the road, the more the AI advances at an exponential pace.
At this point we know that autonomous vehicles are safer, unlike humans they do not consume alcohol, they do not get angry or drowsy. The current danger is the transition period between an autopilot system disengaging and a human taking over the task of driving. And herein lies the danger of Level 4 autonomous driving, the fact that there is a human driver in the vehicle who with every update of the software is becoming more reliant on the AI, and more complacent with their responsibilities.  It is the human tendency to nod off, not pay attention, fall asleep, or be distracted that is the danger.
The current danger behind autonomous vehicles is the transition back and forth between AI and driver, this is why we will soon see an industry push for a rapid transition from level 4 to level 5 autonomy in order to improve road safety for everyone. The sooner this happens the better, after all why would any city choose to endanger passengers by having an on-board human driver, when an anto-pilot is so much safer and less temperamental?
Summary
Driverless vehicles will be more cost effective due to various converging technologies. A reduction in the number of drivers is the most obvious cost reduction, but there will be a reduction in insurance rates for companies. Enterprises will soon begin to demand reduced insurance premiums due to the huge safety benefits of having an autonomous vehicle. Cities will eventually also offer premium benefits to owners of autonomous vehicles, as every avoided collision, is one less potential hospital stay. This is especially the case in more socialist countries like Canada and European nations that offer free healthcare.
Eventually enterprises will rush to remove from the equation the largest liability in a fleet, the driver. With the driver gone, the AI can then navigate streets in the most energy efficient manner, with a significant reduction in accidents, and an improvement in delivery speed.
2021 should be an interesting transition year, Unite.AI looks forward to reporting on the future progress of this disruptive industry.

Of all the potential benefits offered by smart cities, one of the most enticing is greatly improved transportation networks.
As Australia’s major urban areas grapple with the challenges of rising traffic congestion and overcrowded public transportation links, finding ways to make systems more efficient is vital.
Smart city strategies could hold the key.
According to research conducted by KPMG and social enterprise organisation Public Sector Network, smart mobility is one of the top priorities for centres undertaking smart city projects.
Of the cities surveyed, more than half (51 per cent) nominated mobility-as-a-service and congestion management as the key objectives for their programs.Advertisement
Managing director of online automotive marketplace Carsales Australia, Ajay Bhatia, says workplace changes ushered in by the COVID-19 virus are further hastening the need for a smart-city approach to transportation.
Bhatia says research conducted by his firm has found people’s preference for using their own car has increased in the past two months because of infection fears around using public transport.
“Our research found that, of those people who don’t own a car, more than half are now considering buying one,” he says.
As more people return to their workplaces in coming weeks, a new fondness for cars could lead to an increase in traffic congestion and extended commute times.
Traffic congestion management
This could occur despite previous campaigns mounted by authorities to encourage people to consider public transport alternatives.
“Now, more than ever, we need to manage traffic congestion and in a smart city you can do that,” says Bhatia.
“We can use sensor networks and internet of things (IoT) devices to understand when and where peaks occur, where accidents occur, and where people tend to speed.
“When you understand these factors, you can manage traffic flows much better.”
City of Melbourne chief digital officer, Michelle Fitzgerald, says creating an efficient transportation infrastructure within a smart city requires the connection of a range of elements from vehicles and traffic lights, to trams, buses, cyclists, and pedestrians. This, in turn, allows all road users to connect with each other, thereby making the overall system more efficient.
“The City of Melbourne’s Transport Strategy 2030 commits to trial and support new technologies and service models to manage demand for road space to move more people in less space,” she says.
Innovations within the strategy include smarter traffic signals, dynamic lighting solutions, and improved safety for pedestrians.
Sensors in footpaths
Fitzgerald says the city has already installed thousands of sensors in footpaths across the central business district.
This generates a data feed of pedestrian volumes that can be compared with similar time periods in previous weeks or months.
“We can see the impact of various factors such as major events or extreme weather conditions on pedestrian activity and compare the flow to short and long-term averages,” she says.
Melbourne city has also deployed more than 4300 in-ground sensors under street-based car parking bays. These detect vehicle movements in and out of the bays and the length of time each is occupied.
Data is used by parking officers to ensure compliance with restrictions and is also made publicly available to promote creativity.
“There are now a range of free apps available which track Melbourne’s on-street carparks, making it easier than ever to find a carpark,” says Fitzgerald.
Melbourne’s smart-city approach to transportation is similar to that being taken by other cities around the world.
Helsinki example
Many are using data collected via sensor networks to ensure different types of transportation run more efficiently by enabling tighter integration of services.
One example is the Finnish capital of Helsinki. The city has invested heavily on building an integrated transportation network that has reduced traffic congestion and improved the quality of life for residents.
Helsinki-based transport planner Ian Sacs says creating multi-modal transportation infrastructures is an important step towards creating a truly smart city.
“A smart city is one that offers the community a menu of transportation choices,” he says. “The broader that menu, the more options people have. The more options they have, the more trips are distributed across different transportation types. It then ends up being a more robust and resilient city which adds up to being smart.”
Sacs says Helsinki has succeeded in keeping walking and bicycling as a significant part of its transportation mix. These activities currently represent about a third of all trips in the city.
Different vehicle types
Helsinki has built a street network that was designed specifically to cater for a mix of different vehicle types.
There is also an established network of bike paths which mean many trips can be completed without having to ride on a roadway at all.
“Another third of trips in the city are by public transport. [The city has] maintained its love of the tram system and because it is combined with rail, busses and ferries, there is a great mix of transportation modes.”
“Finland and Helsinki have also been good at using technology to support this type of transportation mix,” says Sacs.
“The country has been a pioneer of a concept known as ‘mobility-as-a-service’. This allows different transportation providers to offer their services on a common platform which makes it much easier for residents to choose between different modes.”
Sacs says he is encouraged by the rising number of smart city transportation projects being undertaken around the world.
“You’ve got to get the basics right first,” he says. “If you design the basic infrastructure correctly, it should be easy for cities to accommodate new technologies as they come along in the future.”
A big part of the transport story is ensuring we slowly decarbonise our cities and this will increasingly rely on decentralising energy storage and distribution.
Electric vehicles
According to AGL’s general manager future business Ayala Domani, decentralisation involves home owners, businesses or small communities operating electricity generation such as solar panels or storage assets like batteries for their own use.
“Essentially energy is generated where it is needed,” Ayala says.
“These ‘distributed assets’ help increase the resilience of the grid, better manage supply and demand, and decarbonise the energy sector which includes transport.
“As we decarbonise AGL anticipates the uptake of electric vehicles will be much stronger than what we’ve seen with the uptake of home batteries.
“There will be a broader range of EV models, concerns over how far you can drive will be far less prevalent due to fast charging infrastructure, and prices will fall to the same as an internal combustion engine,” Ayala says.
 “In this scenario, by 2030 more than half of all new sales will be electric vehicles, which is 2.6 million vehicles and 15 per cent of the customer passenger fleet,” she concludes.

As we start a new decade, it’s a good time to reflect on expectations for the next 10 years. Tyler thinks the Great Stagnation could be ending. Caleb sees cracks. Noah expresses techno-optimism. In this post, my aim is not to predict an end or non-end to stagnation. Rather, it is to think through the particulars of how technology could evolve over the next decade. Then we can assess separately whether we should consider it the Roaring 20s or the Boring 20s.
What would constitute an end to the Great Stagnation? Any precise cutoff will be arbitrary, but for the sake of discussion, let’s say sustained growth in utilization-adjusted total factor productivity of 2 percent per year. By comparison, mean utilization-adjusted TFP growth from 1947 through 1972 was 2.1 percent. Since 2005, it has been 0.17 percent. (Note: it is important to use the utilization-adjusted series, as this corrects for the business cycle.)
Whatever your cutoff for TFP growth, one of my convictions is that scientific breakthroughs alone are not enough to drive an end to the Great Stagnation. TFP only budges when new technologies are adopted at scale, and generally this means products, not just science. Science lays critical groundwork for new technology, but after all the science is done, much work remains. Someone must shepherd the breakthrough to the product stage, where it can actually affect TFP. This means building businesses, surmounting regulatory obstacles, and scaling production.
With that caveat firmly in mind, what will the next decade bring in terms of meaningful technological change? Here’s what I’m watching.
Biotech and health
We are coming off a huge win: two new mRNA COVID vaccines, conceived and brought to market in less than a year. The ability to encode and deploy arbitrary mRNA in our bodies sure seems like a game changer—it allows us to essentially program our cells to make whatever proteins we want. In the case of the COVID vaccines, the vaccine payload instructs our cells to make the coronavirus spike protein, which our immune system then learns to attack. Bert Hubert has a fascinating write-up of the “code” in the vaccine.
Bringing a brand new vaccine to market in less than a year—using a never-before-applied-in-humans-at-scale technology no less—is a world record, but it could have been even faster. As David Wallace-Wells emphasizes, Moderna’s vaccine was designed by January 13. We had it the whole time. Some delay was necessary to determine effective dosing. Some further regulatory delay may have been warranted to ensure the vaccine was safe and to ascertain its efficacy. But as Wallace-Wells indicates, the regulatory outcome was never really in doubt. “None of the scientists I spoke to for this story were at all surprised by either outcome,” he writes. “All said they expected the vaccines were safe and effective all along.”
What should we make of the fact that all of the scientists knew all along that Moderna’s vaccine would work? The question in my mind is: what other mRNA treatments do we have the whole time? What if I told you Moderna has an HIV vaccine candidate? HIV lacks SARS-CoV-2’s telltale spike protein and thus may prove a more challenging foe—but don’t you wonder, if we treated the problem with real urgency, whether new mRNA technology could wipe out the AIDS epidemic this decade? I do.
And mRNA technology can be deployed against more than just viruses. Both Moderna and BioNTech have personalized vaccine candidates targeting cancer. Although called a “cancer vaccine,” the treatment is only administered once the subject has cancer—it isn’t preventative. The companies use an algorithm to analyze the genetic sequences of the tumor and the patient’s healthy cells and predict which molecules could be used to generate a strong immune response against the cancer. “I was actually witnessing the cancer cells shrinking before my eyes,” said Brad Kremer, a melanoma patient who received the BioNTech treatment. So let’s milk mRNA technology for all it’s worth this decade. It can save us from more than just a pandemic.
What about CRISPR? It is a great example of a technology that has not yet made a meaningful economic contribution. Although the technique for editing DNA was discovered in 2012—and a Nobel Prize was awarded to its two discoverers this year—no treatment using CRISPR has been approved outside of clinical trials. So far, its impact has been limited to making researchers more productive—not a bad thing, to be sure, but not close to CRISPR’s full potential. As trials progress, however, I do think some CRISPR treatments will come online in the next few years, especially those targeting genetic disorders that we have very limited means of otherwise treating.
DeepMind’s protein-folding breakthrough signals a promising decade for the science of proteomics. Most directly, being able to predict protein shapes will enable us to discover drugs more rapidly. Buuuut, because drug trials take many years, we might expect this technology not to really be felt by the general public until the 2030s.
What DeepMind’s achievement indicates to me the most is that machine learning is actually useful. This might seem obvious, but consider: most applications of machine learning so far—excluding autonomous vehicles, which have themselves not really arrived yet—are toys. I love watching AlphaZero crush Stockfish on YouTube, but chess is literally a game. GPT-3 produced some fun demos. AlphaFold heralds something different—non-toy superhuman performance is now here, and I am interested to see what else it can do. Aside from the aforementioned AVs, I expect it to be applied widely in other areas of biology. Again, it will take a long time for the breakthroughs to trickle down into products, but at least the 2030s should be sick. I mean, not sick. Healthy.
Let’s talk about life extension, one of my favorite biotech topics. 2020 was a big year for the Conboy Lab at Berkeley, which proved that all the weird past findings about “young blood” extending life were not actually due to any elixir in the blood of children (thank goodness). Rather, the rejuvenating aspects of young blood experiments were due to the dilution of harmful factors in old blood. By mechanically removing plasma and replacing it with saline and enough albumin to replace what was taken out, they diluted aged blood factors in both mice and humans and were able to rejuvenate germ layer tissues and improve cognition by reducing neuroinflammation.
These findings are exciting not only because they represent a scientific advance in understanding aging, but also because they herald the first real anti-aging product that could come to market. Therapeutic plasma exchange is FDA-approved (not for aging, but for a bunch of other conditions). I imagine there remain prohibitions on advertising that it can add years to your life, but it is safe, and a doctor can prescribe it off label. It’s also cheap. An automated plasmapheresis machine—which lets you do treatment after treatment—can be bought online for under $3,000. That is less than the cost of a single transfusion of young blood sold by the startup Ambrosia. How long until someone opens a clinic offering plasma dilution? I bet someone tries it in 2021. If it works, people will get over the weirdness, and it could be commonplace by 2030.
Another longevity product that is about to get hot: aging clocks based on DNA methylation or proteomics. Do you want to know how biologically old you are? Today, for a few hundred dollars, you can get a test that will tell you. As these tests become better and cheaper, self-experimenters are going to have a field day. Doing before-and-after aging tests, anyone who can get their hands on human growth hormone could replicate the protocol used by Fahy et al. to rejuvenate the thymus. As the thymus is a critical element of the immune system, decline of which is a critical factor in aging, this is non-trivial rejuvenation. The Fahy study found that 12 months of treatment created about 2.5 years of epigenetic rejuvenation, with results accelerating in the last quarter of the trial.
There is a lot more in the Rejuvenation Roadmap—dozens of possible life-extending treatments are at various stages of development. There’s a good chance a few senolytic drugs will be approved by the end of the decade. As I noted yesterday at Fortune, we spend less than 1% of the NIH budget on aging biology—we should raise that by a lot.
Unlike others, I am not-so-bullish on metformin. It does seem to reduce all-cause mortality in Americans, but it may do so because 88% of Americans are metabolically unhealthy. If you are one of the 12%, and you should strive to be, I don’t think metformin will do much for you.
One final biotech observation: every year, the Apple Watch gets a new health-related sensor. This year it was blood oxygen, pretty good for detecting if you might have COVID! Fast forward to 2030 and wearables will have at least 10 more health-related sensors than they do today. Some no-brainers are body temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose sensors. What will the other 7 be? At some point, it becomes possible to replace a lot of primary care with continuous monitoring. A few smart algorithms to provide simple medical advice could improve population-level health without much cost. More data could also yield faster, more accurate, and of course more remote diagnoses when you do have to see a doctor.
There is a lot in biotech that is promising right now, but in more than any other field, it is important not to be seduced by the sexy headlines showing rapid scientific progress. Don’t get complacent. Biology is proceeding faster than medical productivity because a lot of the wonderful discoveries are not being translated into approved treatments and products at a decent rate. Let’s salute and cheer for the discoveries, but spare many thoughts for the entrepreneurs trying to bring treatments to market.
Energy
The 2010s were the wind and solar decade. We observed stunning declines in the cost of both, although total deployment of wind and solar remains small—in 2019, wind and solar represented less than 9 percent of utility-scale electricity generation in the US. In the 2020s, cost declines will likely stall—wind and solar are already pretty cheap, so the declines of the past decade are not reproducible. Deployment, on the other hand, will accelerate.
Mass deployment of wind and solar will bring challenges. These sources are highly intermittent. When the wind suddenly stops blowing—which happens—we need a way to quickly make up the deficit. Each of the three electricity grids in the continental US—east, west, and Texas—has to remain in supply-demand balance every second of every day. We can use grid storage to smooth out some of the bumps, but storage remains expensive. To reach a grid powered entirely by today’s renewables, we would need storage at a price of $20 per kWh (with caveats).
That storage doesn’t all have to come from batteries, but let’s talk about batteries for a bit. Using Tesla’s grid-scale Powerpack as data, a 232 kWh battery today costs $125,793. That is a price of over $542/kWh. Through innovation, that pricetag will come down over the course of this decade, but improvements on the supply side could easily get swamped by increases in demand. After all, this decade will also include a huge shift toward electric vehicles, which I will discuss below. When demand outpaces supply, prices tend to stay high, even when there is impressive innovation.
With increased deployment of intermittent power generation, increased total demand for electricity due to electric vehicles, a high cost of grid storage, inadequate electricity transmission (have I mentioned that we often neglect to build in this country?), and strong political support for decommissioning fossil fuel plants, the 2020s may be a time of electric grid instability. This could be tempered to some extent by using car batteries as grid resources and through (politically unpopular) variable electricity prices.
Ultimately, we need scalable zero-carbon baseload energy, which means nuclear or geothermal. The problem with nuclear is the high cost. If you look at NuScale’s small modular reactor technology, they are targeting 6.5¢/kWh. That is baseload power, so not directly comparable to wind and solar’s intermittent generation costs, but even so, it isn’t the most competitive in today’s market. Furthermore, NuScale’s flagship project was just delayed three years and is now not scheduled to come online until 2030.
What is more plausible this decade is enhanced and advanced geothermal systems. The legacy geothermal industry is sleepy, tapping energy at traditional volcanic hydrothermal hotspots—forget about it. The next generation of the industry, however, is a bunch of scrappy startups manned by folks leaving the oil and gas industry. The startups I have spoken to think with today’s technology they can crack 3.5¢/kWh without being confined to volcanic regions. With relatively minor advancements in drilling technology compared to what we’ve seen over the last decade, advanced geothermal could reach 2¢/kWh and become scale to become viable just about anywhere on the planet. Collectively, the startups are talking about figures like hundreds of gigawatts of generation by 2030. I’m watching this space closely; the Heat Beat blog is a great way to stay in the loop. As I wrote last month, permitting reform will be important.
Fusion continues to make technical progress. I expect we will get a demonstration of energy-positive fusion in this decade from one of several fusion startups or perhaps Lockheed Martin’s compact fusion reactor. But again: a demonstration is far from a change that transforms society. It will take further decades to deploy reactors onto the grid. By the time fusion gets there, the energy market will be quite different from when we started working on fusion reactors in the 1940s. Wind, solar, and hopefully geothermal will make electricity pretty cheap, and fusion will struggle to compete.
Consider: around half the cost of an advanced geothermal plant is drilling, and half is conversion equipment. Suppose the plant is amortized over 30 years (although many geothermal plants last longer), and after that period the conversion equipment needs to be replaced. But the hole in the ground does not need to be replaced! That means for the next 30 years, electricity can be generated at half the initial cost. Geothermal wells we dig this decade could be producing at less than 1¢/kWh by the 2050s. That is a tough market for fusion to break into. But fusion will still be a great source of power in applications where other sources aren’t available, such as in space.
The 2020s will be a big decade for sustainable alternative fuels (SAF). Commercial aviation can’t electrify—batteries will never match fossil fuels’ energy density. Given political realities, aviation has no choice to decarbonize, which means either hydrogen fuel or SAF. Hydrogen fuel is much better than batteries, but still not as energy dense as fossil fuels or SAF, and so my money is on SAF, and particularly on fuel made from CO₂ pulled from the atmosphere. It is easy to convert atmospheric CO₂ to ethanol in solution; and it is easy to upgrade ethanol into other fuels. But it is hard to separate ethanol from water without using a lot of energy—unless you have an advanced membrane as Prometheus Fuels does. I have written about Prometheus before and continue to follow them closely. Their technology could decarbonize aviation very suddenly.
One final note on energy: there may be very interesting geopolitical consequences in the decade ahead to America’s newfound energy independence. I could easily see, for example, the US deciding we actually don’t need an alliance with the Saudis after all, considering they are journalist-dismembering savages. If the US pulls out of Saudi Arabia, war between the Saudis and the Iranians becomes likely. Which means oil shipments to Asia get disrupted. Which means global chaos. This Zeihanesque scenario is only a scenario, but I’m watching for it.
Transportation
Here’s the thing about electric cars: they are better than regular cars. They have lower fuel costs. They have fewer moving parts and thus lower maintenance costs. They have higher low-end torque and faster acceleration. If you mainly drive to and from work and have a charger at home, you never have to stop for gas. Electric cars will win because they are better, and the shift will happen suddenly.
California will require that new cars purchased after 2035 have zero emissions. For most people, this will be a non-issue, as by 2035 most Californians would not dream of getting an internal combustion engine vehicle. I say this even as a relative battery price pessimist—or more accurately, I am a relative battery price pessimist because I think demand for batteries will be off the charts.
One area where batteries may not work (aside from aviation, already discussed) is trucking. Towing really heavy loads requires a lot of energy—hydrogen fuel cells will be more suited to interstate trucking. The transition from diesel to hydrogen in trucking will likely not be as automatic as the transition from gas to batteries in cars. It’s possible that truckers will need a bit of a push.
As cars shift to electric and trucks shift to hydrogen, air pollution will plummet, especially the currently unregulated ultrafine particles less than 0.1 μm in diameter which cause the worst health harms. There may still be larger particles from tires degrading and so on, but my view is that these do not cause serious health problems. Getting rid of the smallest particles, particularly from diesel fumes, will create health gains which may seem to appear out of nowhere. Fewer premature births, fewer cases of asthma, fewer cancers, fewer mystery illnesses.
Autonomous vehicles could finally happen at scale. Waymo is already in production with a driverless fleet in Phoenix. Tesla has a “full self-driving” computer which might not yet live up to the label, but is nonetheless very cool. Although we have all been continually disappointed by the promise of autonomy right around the corner, it does seem like it has to happen at some point. As sensors and computing power get cheaper, and machine learning algorithms get better, autonomy is inevitable. A decade is a long time, so I am reasonably confident it will happen in the 2020s. It could save a lot of lives. Autonomy, too, will accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles, as fleet companies will prefer the low maintenance costs of battery or fuel cell vehicles.
Let’s do aviation. As everyone knows, I am a huge fan of supersonics. I continue to cheer for my former colleagues at Boom, who will legitimately fly a supersonic aircraft in 2021. Supersonics will have an enormous impact on global business when it arrives at scale, but it’s looking like that won’t be in the 2020s—Boom’s most optimistic timeline per a recent article is a first full-scale airliner by 2026, then several years of certification tests, then a ramp in production to make it matter.
Other contenders: Aerion has a Mach-1.4 business jet design ready to enter production. The key question is whether they can raise the money to build the factory. The business jet market is small, so as an investor you really have to believe they will be able to parlay success on the AS2 into a future airliner program. Hermeus is working on a Mach-5 design point with 20 passengers. Exosonic is targeting Mach 1.8 with low boom technology that could allow it to operate over land. Gulfstream seems to have shuttered their supersonic business jet program, which was never announced in any case.
In addition to Boom’s XB-1 flight test program commencing in 2021, I’ll also be watching two other supersonic flight programs in the early 2020s. NASA’s X-59 will start flying over select cities in 2023 to collect data on acceptable levels of sonic boom. This will pave the way for new standards that unlock overland supersonic flight. NASA is literally making America boom again! In the next couple years, I also expect an unmanned demonstrator flight from Hermeus reaching as high as Mach 5. Awesome, right?
Aside from supersonics, the other exciting development in aviation is the proliferation of urban air mobility companies. Check out Joby, which recently acquired Uber’s Elevate division. Or Wisk, a joint venture between Boeing and Kitty Hawk. Both of these projects could enter service in the first half of the decade. Hyundai also has a new UAM division—look for their product to enter service near the end of the decade.
A key question in my mind regarding urban air mobility is whether regulations will allow autonomy. The business model doesn’t seem like it will work if you have to pay a pilot and lose the space associated with the pilot’s seat, which could otherwise serve an additional passenger. The FAA has been very incremental about allowing even small drones to fly beyond line-of-sight of the operator. In order for urban air mobility to compete with, say, Uber Black, FAA needs to adopt rules for low-altitude air traffic control (called UTM) and figure out a way to certify autonomous operations. Wisk seems pessimistic—they are targeting New Zealand as a first market.
Drone delivery is likely in the 2020s. FAA is about to issue a rule incrementally expanding drone operations, this time allowing operations at night and flights over crowds of people. This is how the FAA operates: use waiver authority to expand the scope of drone operations, and then once they are comfortable with that, make it into a generally applicable rule. I expect the process will incrementally allow bigger and bigger drone delivery programs until they become normal. Those of us who live within five miles of a Class B airport, however, may be out of luck the entire decade.
Let’s talk about tunnels. An efficiently governed country would need some tunnels, but perhaps not very many. China has added 25,000 km of (mostly non-tunnel) high-speed rail since 2008, and there is no technological reason why we couldn’t have done the same. But with a promiscuous distribution of the veto power, building long rail lines above ground becomes challenging. It may therefore be worth the high cost of tunneling to build new high-speed transport options.
The Boring Company has a small, near-operational “loop” under construction in Las Vegas. The project will whiz people around the convention center at up to 155 mph. Expansion plans include the Las Vegas Strip, the airport, and eventually connecting to Los Angeles. Another Boring project, currently mired in environmental review, is the DC-Baltimore Loop, which would connect the two cities’ downtowns in 15 minutes. All of Boring’s loops are designed to be compatible with hyperloop requirements, which would eventually enable 600-mph travel between major cities.
Although the full realization of this technology—a nationwide hyperloop network—is unlikely by 2030, even the 150-mph version is worth following. The time and hassle cost of travel is an important input into the gravity model of trade. I expect the DC-Baltimore Loop to significantly increase economic activity between the two cities—especially helping to revitalize Baltimore, as it would become easier to live there and work in DC.
Space
The big story in space technology for the next 10 years is Starship, as it will enable just about everything else. Let’s compare some launch costs. The Space Shuttle entered service in 1981 and launched successfully 134 times. Each launch cost an inflation-adjusted $1.8 billion. The payload cost to low-Earth orbit (LEO) was $65,400/kg. Today’s workhorse launch vehicle, the Falcon 9, can send cargo to LEO for $2,600/kg. That is a staggering decrease in launch costs.
Starship promises to take this trend much further. On Falcon 9, only the first stage is reusable, whereas on Starship, the entire system—both the booster and the space vehicle—is reusable. Starship runs on dirt cheap liquid methane instead of expensive rocket fuel. It is made out of stainless steel instead of more expensive traditional aerospace materials. SpaceX is talking about churning out Starships at a rate of one every 72 hours for a cost of $5 million each. Operating costs come down with a high flight rate, so Elon is figuring a $1.5-million fully burdened launch cost for 150 tons to LEO. That is $10/kg, more than 100 times cheaper than a Falcon 9 launch today.
It gets even more insane. Because Starship is designed to be refuelable on orbit, its 150-ton payload capacity to LEO equals its payload capacity to anywhere in the solar system. You will be able to launch 150 tons to LEO, load up on fuel while orbiting Earth, and then fly the same payload the rest of the way to the moons of Jupiter. The whole thing could cost less than one Falcon 9 launch—which is limited to 15 tons to LEO in a reusable configuration or 4 tons to Mars in an expendable configuration.
Let’s apply the gravity model of trade once more, this time to commerce between Earth and LEO. Meta-analyses have found that trade (on Earth) is roughly inverse-linear in transport costs. If that holds for space, a 200x cost reduction in travel between Earth and LEO should increase “trade” between Earth and LEO by 200x. Commerce between the Earth and the moon, or between the Earth and Mars, starting from a base close to zero, would be stimulated even more.
It’s worth noting a second-order effect of cheap launch costs. When launch is expensive, more engineering has to go into the payload to ensure reliability. You don’t want to spend $1.8 billion on launch, and then find out, as NASA did with the Hubble Space Telescope, that your new satellite needs repairs. This dynamic has caused over-engineering of space payloads. With launch for a new low price of $10-20/kg, companies and research agencies will be able to reduce engineering expenses by simply taking on the risk of paying for another (cheap) launch.
Since my guiding star is economically noticeable technological progress, let’s talk about that. SpaceX first landed a rocket booster five years ago. They have been undercutting all other players in the medium-lift launch market ever since. But in the grand scheme of things, launch is still a small market. Aside from getting to watch cool livestreams of boosters landing, Falcon 9 has probably not made a noticeable impact on your life (unless you work in the space industry).
That is finally beginning to change with Starlink. As of this month, there are 955 Starlink satellites providing Internet access to thousands of users in a “better-than-nothing” beta test. The constellation size could go as high as 42,000 satellites. Internet speeds are already over 100 mbps down—they seem to be only somewhat attenuated by bad weather. For many rural customers, the service is indeed much better than nothing—better than any other available alternative. With more (and more advanced) satellites in operation, speeds could reach a gigabit. With Starship, the cost of launching these thousands of satellites, and the speed at which the company could do so, will improve. Plan on a full buildout of the network this decade.
Starlink could be a cash cow. The service is not a good fit for most customers—urban populations are too dense and have too many alternative service providers for Starlink to be viable. Elon has said Starlink will serve the 3–4 percent hardest-to-reach customers. In addition to rural customers, it will presumably serve other niches like in-flight wifi on airplanes and Internet access for the crew on container ships.
Let’s call global telecommunications revenue $2.4 trillion. Assume Starlink can capture 3 percent of that. That is $72 billion per year in revenue, faaaaar more than SpaceX makes in launch. In 2019, the company had only $2 billion in revenue. Starlink is a money printer. And it makes you wonder, if SpaceX’s success so far has come on a budget of $2B in annual revenue, what would a $72B-per-year SpaceX do?
How about colonize Mars? I have a bet with Robin Hanson that a human will set foot on Mars by end of Q1 2030. I am not totally confident that this will happen (Robin gave me odds), but the scenario I think is most likely is the following: Starlink prints a lot of money, and SpaceX uses the money to pay for Mars colonization on Starship at a breakneck pace. That results in a human launch to Mars no later than January 2029, landing in September 2029. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell has said it will be a “major company fail” if humans are not flying on Starship (presumably just to LEO) by 2023. With Starlink revenue, SpaceX will be able to do the work on life support systems and mission planning to enable a human mission by 2029. NASA could be involved as a partner, but SpaceX would tolerate zero government obstacles.
Starship is also still in the running to be the landing vehicle for NASA’s Artemis missions. If it is not selected, that seems like a colossal error. To be sure, choosing Starship would represent a huge change of plans for NASA, which had been assuming a congressionally supported boondoggle relying on the Space Launch System, the Orion capsule, and a moon-orbiting Gateway. While Artemis’s goal is a human mission to the moon’s south pole by 2024, the schedule could easily slip. But by leveraging the new opportunities afforded by Starship, a permanent moon base by the end of the decade seems highly plausible.
With lower launch costs, what else is possible? Varda is a new company working on in-space manufacturing. Microgravity means that structures can be used that would collapse under their own weight on Earth. As a result, certain pharmaceuticals, fiber optics, semiconductor wafers, and nanotube materials can be manufactured in space that can’t be made on our planet. Lots of people want to bring manufacturing back to America, but putting manufacturing in orbit is much more exciting.
How about asteroid mining? I think this is still a ways off. There’s no question that it could be profitable someday. The street value of the materials on 16 Psyche back on Earth is $10 quintillion—even allowing for the inevitable hefty price slippage, space resource extraction could make a few trillionaires. I would love to be proven wrong, but I don’t think serious space mining will happen until the 2030s at the earliest. Again, however, cheap launch costs could be a game changer.
Information technology
Custom silicon is going to be huge. The rave reviews for Apple’s new custom system-on-a-chip platform demonstrate its inevitability. For machine learning, Cerebras has a full wafer-sized SoC. Tesla’s “full self-driving” computer likewise uses custom silicon. Almost all computer hardware—anything that has any scale to it—will move in this direction, because the performance benefits are so large. In a way, it’s a repetition of what happened before in semiconductors: individual transistors gave way to the integrated circuit. This change is simply taking integration another level further. Note: we lack the capability to manufacture these SoCs (at least good ones) in North America. Given their strategic importance, it may be worth remedying that.
The 2020s will be the decade that makes or breaks cryptocurrency. Well, nothing will ever break cryptocurrency—true believers will run the networks forever no matter what. But for cryptocurrency to have long-run value, I still hold that it needs to have mainstream uses. This means it needs to scale, it needs a good user experience, and normal people need to actually use it to transact. If it can’t reach that point by the end of the decade, I think it will have failed to have lived up to its promise. I am still cautiously optimistic. I think migration to proof-of-stake, lower transaction costs, more refined tools, and mature standards could lead to mainstreaming.
By the middle of the decade, augmented reality will be widely deployed, in the same way that smart watches are today. Glasses will be computing devices. Every big tech company has a glasses project at a relatively mature stage in the lab today. The need for the glasses to understand context could result in much smarter digital assistants than today’s Siri, Alexa, and so on.

• The connected e-bike sharing solution designed by the Italian company MERMEC appointed Honoree at CES 2021 Innovation Awards, in the Vehicle Intelligence and Transportation category
• The Company announces a new agreement with Swedish operator Voi Technology
VAIMOO, the connected e-bike sharing solution designed by Mermec,  the Italian multinational company providing advanced transport technologies, is the only Italian project  to receives the CES 2021 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Vehicle Intelligence and Transportation  category.
 
VAIMOO – Vehicles Artificial Intelligence MO(O)ved – is the complete e-bike sharing solution including  electric bikes, charging stations and mobile apps for using the service, which improves fleet distribution  and maintenance through artificial intelligence algorithms, real-time geo-location and operational data  from the field. 
The system has been designed to adapt to any micro-mobility and last-mile transport scenarios, both  public and private, and exploits the full potential of IoT (Internet of Things) technologies for rapid  integration with other transport systems, such as metro, train or bus, aiming to ensure a unique and  well-integrated travel experience. 
The attention to user-friendliness can be experienced even before getting on the saddle. Indeed,  starting a ride is very easy: just tap the smartphone on the dedicated surface on the e-bike handlebars  to automatically start the VAIMOO app and unlock the electric bike. In addition, the smartphone can be  used as a bike display and smart navigator. E-bikes can be found in the docking stations as well as in  free-floating mode around the city, thus flexibly meeting the needs of municipalities and different users,  such as tourists, commuters or students. 
For all these reasons, in addition to the prestigious CES award, the company announces the signing of  a new agreement with Swedish Voi Technology – Europe’s leading micro-mobility service provider – which has chosen VAIMOO connected e-bikes to extend and differentiate its e-scooter sharing service  in the UK. This agreement follows VAIMOO’s launch in Copenhagen and Rotterdam. 
‘We are honoured and excited to be awarded the CES Innovation Awards with VAIMOO’ claimed Matteo  Pertosa, Project Director and Member of the Board of Directors at Mermec ‘This is the third time  in the last four years that one of the Angel Group companies has received this award, but it’s always a  great result for the whole team and a further confirmation of the validity of our solution that aims to  contribute to the creation of an intermodal and inclusive transport system, now essential in every  metropolitan city. Unlike scooters, e-bikes are very ‘democratic’ because anyone can easily use them. 
For us, 2021 will be an important year full of news, with the signing of strategic agreements and product  developments that will allow us to grow steadily in the international market.’
The CES Innovation Awards is an annual competition honouring outstanding design and engineering in  consumer technology products across 28 product categories. The awards are assigned by a  distinguished panel of industry designers, engineers and media who, through the CES Innovation  Awards, identify unique products, future trends and technologies developed by industry to change the  lives of society.

 If you want to gauge the recent interest in developing autonomous trucks, follow the money. 
Tech startups and established OEMs alike have since early 2019 announced billions of dollars of funding for autonomous vehicle initiatives. This March, even the Canadian Pension Plan (CPP) Investment Board was part of a $2.25-billion investment round in Waymo, the former Google self-driving car project that has expanded into trucking.
In other words, some of your retirement savings are banking that a future truck will perform selected driving tasks as well as you can. Maybe better.
“We’re aggressively ramping up our investment in the trucking application,” says Waymo’s product manager for trucking, Matt Carroll, a native of London, Ont. “We will likely see fully driverless trucks across the industry begin to hit the road within the coming years.”
Truck drivers are not expected to be replaced by such trucks anytime soon. Tests on some of today’s most sophisticated autonomous prototypes are focusing on clearly defined routes and tasks. But some of the required technical capabilities are already emerging in trucks on the market.
Daimler and Volvo have in recent months also unveiled dedicated business units to explore autonomous vehicle technologies. And Europe’s ZF, which has already demonstrated an autonomous shunt truck and container-hauling configuration, has been named a manufacturing partner for TuSimple, one of the largest tech startups focused on the vision.
“We have experienced a significant increase in inquiries from customers,” said Volvo president and CEO Martin Lundstedt, during the launch of Volvo Autonomous Solutions. “It is a logical next step for us to gather expertise and resources in a new business area with profit and loss responsibility to take autonomous transport solutions to the next level.”
Autonomous vehicle tests
For some companies, that next level involves taking test vehicles onto tracks and even the open highway. TuSimple’s fleet of 41 autonomous-capable trucks are pulling 13 loads per day between Arizona and Texas. It’s teamed up with UPS, Penske Truck Leasing, U.S. Xpress and McLane to launch an Autonomous Freight Network by 2024, consisting of autonomous trucks, digitally mapped routes, strategic terminal locations, and a proprietary monitoring system.
“The potential for automating driving is just amazing,” said Daimler AG truck and bus leader Martin Daum, when recently announcing the OEM was taking a majority stake in Torc Robotics – a business developing the artificial intelligence (AI) needed to read the road and make driving decisions.
Suman Narayanan, DTNA’s director of engineering – autonomous technology group, refers to Torc’s primary contribution as a “software stack” that draws on data collected through radar, lidar and cameras. Related successes were some of the keys to developing the Asimov system for self-driving cars, and supported Caterpillar’s retrofit of autonomous mining trucks.
“It’s a giant leap in terms of technology advancement,” Narayanan says of the shift from Level 2 to Level 4.
The limits of technology
But even those who develop autonomous vehicle systems stress the limits to the technologies. The need to focus on defined operating areas tops them all.
“Our focus is not on urban traffic,” Narayanan said as an example, noting that the early applications will be specific highways. “We want to start where we can maximize value.”
“No one will lose their job with this technology,” agrees TuSimple head of government and public affairs Robert Brown. He’s confident that someone starting a career as a truck driver today would still retire behind the wheel, with emerging systems focusing on routes like those between distribution centers. “We’re not talking dense urban downtown Vancouver or something like that.”
“We’re not removing brake pedals and steering wheels from the vehicles,” he adds.
One high-profile prototype did remove the cab, though. Volvo’s Vera is better described as a self-directed chassis rather than a truck.
Sasko Cuklev, director – autonomous solutions at Volvo Trucks, says its first assignments will involve shuttling containers a “short distance” from a Swedish logistics center to a port. It’s the type of work that he envisions as an early adopter of autonomous technologies: “Hub-to-hub applications with shorter distances, repetitive flows, high volumes of goods, lower speed, typically A-to-B transport. For example, from a port to a distribution center, port to a manufacturing plant, or in between distribution centers.”
The port settings align with a term Brown uses to describe the role of autonomous trucks: “Intermodal 2.0”. Truck drivers would still interact with equipment at both ends of any trip, supporting things like pickup and delivery applications. People would still be needed for support, oversight, inspections, deployment, and arrival.
In the process, the technologies would offer an extra level of safety systems, combining the unblinking eyes of things like cameras and lidar, and introducing responses that are faster than human reflexes. Throughout a conversation, Narayanan repeatedly refers to the technology as a layer of safety, comparing it to things like hours of service rules and other driver assistance systems.
“We also see the need to addressing the monotony that some of the highway driving can bring,” he says.
Platooning promise or limits
Other potential gains have been a matter of debate. The higher level of autonomous controls would be central to platooning, which involves tucking tractor-trailers from nose to tail, closing gaps in the name of aerodynamics.
Daimler abandoned that concept, arguing that the fuel economy gains are lost in real-world settings, as platoons break apart and re-establish themselves in traffic. Volvo has tested platoons with FedEx, but Cuklev declined to comment on early lessons.
In the midst of it all, some other autonomous vehicle initiatives have stopped dead in their test tracks.
Uber paid US $600 million to acquire Otto, which made headlines with a hands-free shipment of Budweiser beer in 2016. But it dropped the idea of autonomous trucks shortly after inking a legal settlement with Waymo, which had accused former employee and Otto founder Anthony Levandowski of stealing information.
Meanwhile, Starsky Robotics shut down earlier this year, only months after sending a truck 15 kilometers down a Florida expressway without a driver in the cab. Driving at both ends of the trip was accomplished remotely, with an operator working controls in an office setting. In the wake of the closure, company founder Stefan Seltz-Axmacher openly questioned factors that attract investors, and highlighted the slow advance of artificial intelligence.
“The space was too overwhelmed with the unmet promise of [artificial intelligence] to focus on a practical solution,” he wrote in a blog for Medium. “As those breakthroughs failed to appear, the downpour of investor interest became a drizzle. It also didn’t help that last year’s tech IPOs took a lot of energy out of the tech industry, and that trucking has been in a recession for 18 or so months.”
“The systems cannot have faults that require the human to intervene,” he said. “The reliability of the vehicle needs to be second to none.”
Like a ‘phenomenal’ truck driver
The goal is for autonomous vehicle systems that do everything a “phenomenal” human driver does today, Narayanan says, referring to the need for redundant systems.
“Right now, the failsafe we have in our truck is a human driver,” he continues. They know how to respond to an ABS warning lamp in the dash, for example. “We must have a brake system or steering system that is built in such a way that they can monitor their health constantly.”
There’s no room for error. Any failures could be disastrous.
While autonomous truck test have been spared high-profile accidents, the same can’t be said for autonomous cars. Elaine Herzberg was struck and killed by an Uber test vehicle in Arizona. A Tesla traveling in its “autopilot” mode failed to identify the side of a white trailer. Such collisions also seem to combine technical failures and operator error. The drivers behind the wheel tended to be engaged in other activities, like watching movies.
Ongoing barriers are not limited to technology alone.
“We can handle pretty wild weather,” Brown insists, referring to successful tests that have ranged from high winds to night driving. The one notable exception is finding a way to track vehicle positions in snow. “It’s definitely on our road map.” It’s just not there yet.
“Surface streets are a much more challenging domain compared to freeways since they tend to be more unstructured, the differences between one and another tend to vary more — while highways are pretty similar to one another — and there are more long-tail events to consider,” says Waymo’s Carroll.
The practical considerations don’t end there. Who would a CVSA inspector or law enforcement officer interact with when a Level 4 truck controls itself, Brown asks. Issues like that would likely leave any autonomous trucks in the hands of specialized users.
‘A very sticky relationship’
“It’ll be a very sticky relationship, so with won’t be like you can buy a truck and just run it,” he says of TuSimple’s model. “There’s data infrastructure. There’s a lot that goes into this, the mapping, so it can’t just be, ‘buy a truck off the shelf.’”
The rules that govern such trucks need to evolve as well, even though they are expected to share routes traveled by human drivers. But there has been movement. The U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Administration has already unveiled some of the guidance that vehicle developers need to follow.
“We are seeing significant investments in more advanced Automated Driving Systems (ADS) that might one day allow vehicles to drive themselves and thereby have the potential to greatly reduce the number of fatal crashes involving human error or poor choices,” NHTSA acting administrator James Owens said in November, in testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
“But as with any revolution, these developments also carry uncertainty. Advanced technologies may not always work as designed or advertised… If the history of other vehicle technologies is any guide, some versions of these technologies will work better than others.”
Early in 2018, Canada’s Senate Committee on Transport and Communications expressed concerns that Canada is ill-prepared for the arrival of autonomous vehicles, too.
“It is not a matter of if,” the Senate report concluded, “but when more sophisticate automated and connected vehicles will arrive on Canadian roads.”

 As smart sensors are placed in billions of connected devices around the world, new IoT applications are generating massive streams of data that enable a world of opportunities. 
Consider the rise of smartwatches that allow people to track their fitness, monitor their sleeping patterns, measure their heart rate, and more. Think of a future where self-driving cars are able to collect, process, and store driving data at the edge to make road travel safer and more enjoyable.
As mobility and ways of working continues to be redefined, Khwaja Saifuddin, senior sales director, Middle East, Western Digital, highlights the top nine use cases of the IoT technologies.
Autonomous and connected vehicles
Down the road, vehicles might be able to reach Level 5 autonomy and drive themselves fully without human intervention. Today, however, car makers and automotive startups are working on getting level 2, 3, and 4 self-driving technology right. Cameras, radar, LIDAR and a host of other onboard sensors are being used to capture information about road conditions, inform appropriate driving actions, and potentially prevent accidents. To make this happen, nearly 1 terabyte of data will be stored onboard in the near-term, and this amount could balloon to 2+ terabytes in the next decade.
Yet, there’s more to the cars of tomorrow than just autonomous driving. Thanks to the Internet of Things, cars can communicate with each other, the road infrastructure, and, perhaps someday, even pedestrians by using “vehicle-to-everything” or “V2X” technology. Fleets of autonomous vehicles could be managed through this type of communication, making travel faster and safer. Onboard the car, IoT-enabled devices could improve the engine diagnostics, GPS data, and infotainment system.
Smart security for businesses and homes
Historically, security systems often simply used a low-resolution camera to passively capture video. This trend held whether at private residences or commercial properties. Now, smart security systems are being purpose-built to capture, store, and analyse continuous video streams. On top of the 4K video captured by high-resolution cameras, these systems can use an analytics layer with machine learning software to carry out pattern recognition and motion detection. For public transportation providers and venue managers, these real-time insights play a meaningful role in public safety – thanks to robust storage and compute at the device-level.
Connecting your home to the Internet (of Things)
What if your home could be mostly automated? That’s the direction that connected home technology is headed in this IoT use case. Smart speakers function like a central command, enabling your household electronics to perform a variety of voice-activated functions. You could, for example, instruct your TV to stream the latest episode of your favorite show while dimming the living room lights and setting the thermostat to a cozy temperature. This approach stretches even further by integrating refrigerators, washers, dryers, and more. The goal is to provide control for most or all of a home’s systems – including energy, climate, entertainment, appliances, and home security – through a connected network of devices, sensors, tools and platforms.
Smartwatches, fitness trackers, and other wearables
Thanks to an influx of new personal devices, the wearables market is thriving. In fact, a recent report predicts that this industry will cross over $27 billion and 233 million units sold annually by the year 2022. This global adoption is due in large part to smartwatches, which are expected to make up over half of all wearables sold in the coming years. Consumers are looking for seamless connection and interaction between their smartphones and smartwatches to track, manage, and secure their data — especially sensitive health data. At the same time, industry analysts are forecasting flat-to-declining sales for fitness trackers – possibly due to a perceived lack of features and inability to sync with existing smartphones.
But, technological innovation won’t just come on the wrist. A new subcategory known as “hearables” could disrupt the wearables industry, using voice-activated, connected headphones and earphones. With more headset makers ditching the headphone jack, these types of devices are expected to become commonplace in the future. Another opportunity is in portable medical devices that monitor blood pressure and heart rate, as well as alert ambulance dispatchers during a medical emergency.
Machine-to-machine (M2M) connected devices
Today’s factories are using IoT-enabled machines to work smarter, not harder. By equipping machines with sensors, factory managers can more accurately map machine workloads, inputs, and outputs. They can also more closely track machine wear-and-tear, which leads to maintenance that is predictive rather than reactive and improves lifespan. With these features, factories are increasingly becoming automated, thanks to the wave of Industry 4.0. M2M devices use embedded and removable flash solutions to aggregate data into a single stream at the edge. This gateway is used to monitor and react to changing conditions on the factory floor. At the same time, unused data is passed on to the central cloud or data center for further processing.
Supply chains of the future
Another IoT use case is in supply chains, which are increasingly global and complex. Customer requirements evolve rapidly, products have to be procured, shipping and delivery routes have to be coordinated – you get the picture. In response, companies are creating connected enterprise systems and using data modeling as a key part of a broader data management strategy. Low-power IoT devices are also being used to track assets throughout the supply chain, and monitor product quality such as temperature, vibration and container openings. By using IoT-enabled devices and transportation routes, further improvements can be made to route planning by collecting in-transit, supply chain data.
Drones for industrial and search and rescue operations
For cinematographers and photographers, drones have helped record stunning landscapes previously unavailable to visual artists. But, these flying devices aren’t just used for this purpose. Oil rig workers are using drones to complete full rig inspections quicker, without sacrificing worker safety or production downtime. Ecommerce companies are looking into drone delivery of their buyers’ goods to their front doorstep. Even nonprofits are making use of drones to monitor deforestation in environmentally-fragile communities.
Outside of commercial uses, drones are serving the public good in search and rescue missions. These machines are helping search and rescue teams locate victims more quickly, evaluate the status of victims, and map the right path for rescue missions. In dangerous mountain rescues, successful drone operations require high performance and high capacity data storage. Read our latest white paper about how reliable storage makes a difference in life-threatening emergencies.
Smart cities: Energy, transportation, parking and more
One of the most promising IoT use cases is in creating smarter, more efficient cities. Public energy grids can be optimised to balance workloads, predict energy surges, and distribute energy more equitably to customers. The same goes for transportation systems in dense, urban environments. Traffic lights could be synced using IoT to adapt to traffic conditions in real-time. During an emergency, first responders can communicate with traffic lights to synchronise and provide direct access to critical locations. Another possibility is to digitally track parking, so that available spaces are automatically sent as push notifications to drivers looking for a place to park.
Farm to tech to table
Today’s farmers are bringing the power of IoT to streamline their operations. As the use of free-range livestock becomes widely adopted, connected technology can track animals as they graze in open pastures. Smart sensors placed in irrigation systems can reduce water consumption to create just the right moisture level in soil for a given crop. It’s even being used to watch over factors such as humidity and temperature in composting. Additionally, farmers can keep tabs on their equipment, mapping out where each item is, tracking its performance, and carrying out predictive maintenance. Outside of traditional farms, wine producers are using IoT to understand grapevine health and sugar levels in grapes.
Western Digital offers an extensive portfolio of products from devices to systems and platforms designed to enable the power and possibilities of data driven by IoT and edge computing.
Object storage solutions built on Western Digital Ultrastar platforms, including the Ultrastar Data60 Hybrid Storage Platform and the Ultrastar Data102 Hybrid Storage Platform, are designed to handle massive amounts of data generated by IoT. The company also offers adaptive solutions to handle everything from small footprint storage for the application stack of smart sensors to an Edge gateway server to facilitate the advancements in M2M connected devices. As a trusted partner for industrial IoT, the Ultrastar NVMe Series, and Ultrastar SATA Series SSD deliver the performance necessary to minimise latency and maximise responsiveness.

Hidden in plain sight on an old government farm near downtown Ottawa is a 1,800-acre playground for tech entrepreneurs: a smart city called Area X.O.
While the name may evoke thoughts of alien investigations, Area X.O is all about business and innovation. Powered by its own super speed 5G wireless network with live input from traffic and aviation partners, this state-of-the-art smart city is bringing companies from around the world together to test technology that could revolutionize communities.
“This site gives us the opportunity to try new things, see what people want, test it out, and if it validates, we move forward,” Michael Tremblay, CEO of Invest Ottawa, told CTV News.
At the private compound, companies can develop and test out autonomous vehicles, drones, smart agriculture and even projects related to defence and security, all in a real-world setting. There are roadways, traffic lights and even a railway crossing.
According to their website, part of Area X.O’s vehicle testing facilities include the ability to simulate all four seasons, putting vehicles through temperatures ranging from -39 degrees Celsius to 39 degrees Celsius.
This week, the federal government announced it would be putting $7 million in funding towards Area X.O so that smaller businesses that normally can’t afford to use expensive technology in their development or testing of products can have an opportunity to work with those tools at Area X.O.
One of the projects tested at the facility is a mobile command unit which uses drones to locate missing people, and then sends an autonomous emergency vehicle automatically to their location.
Shawn Sparling, vice president of Enterprise and Public Sector at Nokia Canada, told CTV News that the 5G network allows “instantaneous communication from all the devices in the area,” making it a prime location to test tech that relies on wireless communication, such as this innovation in search and rescue.
Nokia is one of the founding partners of Area X.O.
“Nokia brings the communications piece, but we need small, medium, large companies to work with and bring solutions around the 4G, 5G networks, so we can address manufacturing search and rescue with their applications,” Sparling said. “This environment here allows us to work with them closely and do a lot of testing.”
From sensors that stop driverless cars when someone is in the crosswalk, to self-driving tractors, all these creations aim to make life safer and easier in a more connected world.
GPS Ontario, a company that works on implementing technological innovations into agriculture, is testing tractors that can function autonomously and more efficiently at Area X.O.
“One of the biggest issues we have in agriculture right now is actually getting skilled workforce,” he told CTV News. “Having the ability to have a tractor that knows where it needs to go and what it needs to be doing at the same time is going to give us that […] [ability to] put almost anybody in the tractor cab now and run the same accuracy as if the farm owner or farmer himself was in the tractor.”
He said that one of the big advantages of Area X.O is the telecommunications and tools already in place that allow them to do more testing than is possible on a regular farm.
These tractors will still have a driver in them for oversight, but less pressure is on the driver to do everything.
“The driver in the tractor literally has to say: ‘Yes, I would like you to turn,’ and the system’s preprogrammed, ready to go, to where it needs to be driving,” Wallace said.
They’re working on being able to send commands to an autonomous tractor that would allow it to make choices between types of fertilizer or split planter varieties, and are hoping that the efficiencies this technology could introduce might even make farming more environmentally friendly and more cost-effective for farmers.
With the government’s promised funding for Area X.O, 200 jobs will be created, adding to the 230 people who already work at the facility, helping to provide a glimpse into future uses of technology in Canada.

Autonomous vehicles are one of the most talked-about technological breakthroughs of the past decade. But as we approach the end of another year of testing issues and minimal developments within the industry, is it fair to say that the self-driving car’s rollout is stalling? 
In October 2020, Tesla grabbed the world’s attention with the arrival of its ‘Full Self Driving’ software for car owners to allow drivers to park, stay in a lane at cruising speed automatically, and stop at red lights. The unveiling was supposed to represent a significant step towards fully self-driving technology.What’s holding autonomous vehicles back? Before entering the market, self-driving cars will have to hurdle many issues, such as cybersecurity. || #IoTForAll #IoTClick To Tweet
However, according to Fortune, there are fears that the name ‘Full Self Driving’ may be misleading to some drivers, who could mistakenly assume that their car needs no supervision. Regulators have warned users to monitor the technology closely and “take action to protect the public against unreasonable safety risks”.
According to the chart published in Medium in 2018, 2020 was the year in which fully autonomous vehicles began to enter the market. However, by industry standards, even Tesla’s Full Self Driving software can only be considered an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). 
So what’s holding autonomous vehicles back? Let’s take a deeper look at some of the more significant issues that self-driving cars need to hurdle before entering the market.
The Fallacy of Machines Thinking Like Humans
One of the biggest issues to overcome is that, despite huge advancements in IoT technology, computers are a long way from possessing humans’ levels of intelligence. 
Of course, when it comes to individual tasks like identifying objects in pictures or following simple commands in a static environment, machines can far outperform humans. Still, many of these skills aren’t applicable in a more general situation. 
While the act of driving a car and understanding when red lights appear may be achieved by simple machines, the sheer volume of variables that occur during driving means that machines will be required to obtain huge levels of intelligence and adaptability. 
In a 2017 essay, leading robotics and artificial intelligence researcher, Rodney Brooks, stated that autonomous vehicles were not viable in the short-term due to the number of ‘edge cases’ that present themselves while driving. This refers to how often unusual events occur – such as the poor driving of others, obstacles on the road, and misleading road markings. 
While humans are naturally capable of reacting to unusual events and making swift adjustments, machines can struggle to understand how to adapt their actions to respond in the right way to the road in front of them, for instance. 
Obstacles to Sensors
Autonomous vehicles use multiple sensors to interact with the environment around them. This helps to detect objects like pedestrians, other vehicles android signs. Cameras can also help the car view objects and understand the distance between the vehicle and anything in its path. Radars can also chart the speed and direction of other vehicles and objects. 
These sensors provide feedback to the car’s control system to advise where to steer or stop. Fully autonomous cars require a wide range of sensors that can detect objects with accuracy while quickly determining their distance and speed in every possible condition to ensure safety at all times. 
However, factors like bad weather, dense traffic, weathered road signs, or damaged markings can significantly impact sensors’ capabilities. 
For truly autonomous vehicles to work, the sensors used need to be highly adaptive and strong enough to understand signals in the worst conditions in a range of environments. Given that accidents have occurred with Tesla models where cars have hit parked vehicles, it shows that there’s still some way to go in developing reliable autonomous sensors.
Cybersecurity Fears
There may be widespread concerns about the safety of autonomous vehicles in technical understanding and reacting to obstacles. Still, there’s also a significant danger that the interconnected vehicles could become the victim of cyberattacks.

Terms and Conditions
Transportation reporter Christian Wolmar reported that widespread hackings have happened “in other areas of computing, such as the big-data hacks and security lapses, and it will happen in relation to autonomous cars.” 
Given the dangers associated with a vehicle that’s been compromised by a hacker, any security issues within the firmware of cars will see widespread disruption occur as a result––making it extremely difficult to see the rollout of autonomous vehicles before rigorous tests are conducted. 
Complexity of Insurance
There’s a whole host of financial issues attached to the rollout of autonomous vehicles. The matter of insurance and where the responsibility lies should accidents occur, a big hurdle to overcome. 
Traditionally, drivers pay insurance for their cars to cover any accidents taking place. Still, when a vehicle is entirely autonomous, there’s no reason for an owner to pay out when it’s likely to be the fault of the vehicle itself. 
The arrival of self-driving cars will spark a reformation of how owners pay for their cars. If insurance falls on the manufacturer, it could see the costs of vehicles rising further. In a world that’s become more accustomed to purchasing vehicles on HP or PCP finance, the complexity of ownership could be wholly off-putting for prospective buyers. 
That said, there’s little doubting that autonomous vehicles will have a role to play in the future of motoring. Whether the technology and its complicated connotations develop to the point where we could see private vehicles hitting the roads by the end of the decade, or more likely that way see some form of light delivery vehicles rolled out, it’s a testament to interconnectivity and the potential for innovation in the industry.

When we talk about the future of logistics, it is all pertains to the speed of responding to market changes and staying ahead of the demand curve by leveraging operational responsiveness.
By Abhik Mitra
In the past decade, shopping has evolved greatly for consumers over the years as the online experience has gone through several stages of improvements.  India’s e-commerce growth has soared and continues to do so, at an annual rate of 51 per cent, which is also the highest for any region in the world. The market will stand at $200 billion by 2026, and the pandemic outbreak has accelerated it. The massive growth of e-commerce, new consumption patterns, and retail models have impacted businesses in an unprecedented way. Faster and shorter demand cycles create a strong need for flexibility and agility in e-commerce logistics.
Same or next-day delivery or even four-hour express delivery options are business as usual today. This complexity and need for real-time fulfillment call for greater efficiency, speed, and accuracy, and on a larger scale. While e-commerce has made the life of consumers extremely convenient, the competition to deliver goods to consumers at a quicker pace has grown immensely. While it’s economical to transport cargo, the cost of operation tends to shoot up to fulfill such express deliveries every day across a million destinations. Conditioned to use traditional systems, responding to such changes will then be a challenge for e-commerce players. This further means high capital investments and long gestation periods while the operations continued to grapple with the onslaught of the parcel growth.
The current scenario has put a spotlight to improve last-mile logistics and modify supply chains to cater to these complexities. E-commerce companies have realized this and have developed a targeted approach to compete effectively. They are now deploying advanced technologies to strike the right balance between customers’ delivery expectations and sustaining their own profitability.
In the last few years, e-commerce logistics has evolved. Companies across the globe have seen a massive demand in these technologies, to match the dramatic evolution – in terms of volumes and value. Whether it is autonomous vehicles, drones, or GPS-monitored robots that are being developed for last-mile deliveries in the cities or inhouse robotics and automation making warehouse hubs advanced, the scenario is changing.
 There is the use of inbuilt RFID, GPS, and IoT, and telematics is being used for tracking inventory on the move. With the continual growth of e-commerce and deliveries becoming the norm, the pressure on supply chains is propelling the e-commerce logistics managers to adopt new solutions to enhance business agility and growth.
Ecommerce logistics will emerge as a massive market opportunity, for new innovation and growth. As the pandemic has made it more evident, our dependence on e-commerce will only grow, and the avenues in this space will expand. If e-commerce needs to grow in India, the successful businesses of the future will need to be swift and agile enough to take advantage of technologies –to the accelerated change to help deliver millions of parcels every day.
When we talk about the future of logistics, it is all pertains to the speed of responding to market changes and staying ahead of the demand curve by leveraging operational responsiveness. To exploit market responsiveness as a strategy, it will become imperative to optimize logistics and supply chain mechanisms. 
With the backdrop of Industry 4.0, digitization and evolution of customer behavior, e-commerce, and supply chain evolution have a long way to go. With the infiltration of technology, e-commerce logistics will transform from what it is today. It is already transforming and the next decade. Technology will play this role – to drive more agility, productivity, and the best customer experience. It is only onwards and upwards for everyone to witness how our home deliveries become innovative!

With the accelerated digitisation of the world, the automotive industry is gearing up to an enormous change in 2021.
The automotive industry has long been a place where industrial and tech sector disrupts to make innovative solutions. The industry is adopting technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data & analytics that have been around for a while, and newer technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain are also finding numerous applications in the automotive sector. With the accelerated digitisation of the world, the automotive industry is gearing up to an enormous change in 2021. The sector has seen unprecedented twists and turns in the past ten years. They’ve turned sleeker, safer and capable of higher speeds. 
Ultimately, just like how McKinsey reported in 2016, the auto industry is gradually moving towards the future age, wherein automakers will find themselves generating more revenue and users will find themselves enjoying innovative driving solutions. But 2020 was a slow year with not many people buying cars during the Covid-19 pandemic period. However, the industry is starting to rebound and gives an array of hope to everyone. Henceforth, Analytics Insight brings you a list of tech trends that will dominate the automotive industry in 2021.
AI-based autonomous vehicle
AI-based autonomous vehicles are the frontrunners in the automotive industry. Artificial intelligence is already enabling smart travel methods through self-driving cars. These cars do not require drivers and rely on sensors and software for navigation and control. Autonomous vehicles are aimed to reduce the need for human drivers and make everyday transport easy. Studies reflect that there are around 1,400 self-driving cars on the US roads today. 
Even though when it is not a big number, the change of mind in people to go for or trust autonomous vehicles is drastically increasing. Big players like Tesla, Google, Uber are strongly pushing the limits of autonomous cars, making it more reliable. However, the Covid-19 pandemic was a big hit which temporarily staggered the improvement of self-driving vehicles. With the autonomous vehicle industry estimated to be worth US$556 million by 2026, investments will likely continue to pour in, especially as further applications are explored.
Digital marketing and dealing
The futuristic view of selling automotive vehicles online came to effect during the coronavirus pandemic. Even though when in-person visiting to dealership stores and trial driving was a mandatory part of buying a car, the lockdown protocols that limited the move switched its track to online medium. Not all, but at least a small proportion of people feel comfortable about the change. 
Vehicle buyers are able to compare different car models unlike going on with the dealer’s suggestion. Modern dealerships are trying to normalise online car buying by offering provisions starting form virtual tours to secure checkout, online financial options and returns policies. So far, 81% of the buyers are not okay with buying new or old cars online. However, this is expected to change in 2021.
Electrification
The increase in fossil fuel rate and the harm to the environment caused by their use has changed the automotive industry outlook to electric vehicles (EVs). Cars contribute to 15% of carbon emissions, which deplete precious fossil fuel reserves and causes potential irreversible environmental damage. 
Electric cars on the other hand are addressing the challenges by leveraging a higher level of energy efficiency and reduced fuel usage. In August 2020, there were over 1.6 million electric vehicles on the US road, which is exponentially higher than the expected 1.4 million by 2024. Still, for greater adoption and people’s acceptance, electric vehicles need to come up with solutions on high price, poor battery, inadequate charging infrastructure, fleet electrification and renewable energy-based charging grids.
Blockchain
Blockchain has been likened to the second generation of the internet. It has the ability to transform an organisation’s processes. This includes sharing vehicle data over a secure network for connectivity and shared mobility solutions such as ride-hailing, urban transportation and deliveries. Blockchain is used in the verification process to improve efficiency across supply chain and back-office works. It can be utilized in management and incentives to improve vehicle information and usage data across the industry. The disruption of blockchain in automotive is anticipated to increase in the upcoming year.
3D printing
The automotive industry is always facing a demand for new vehicles and spare products. The thirst for newer, better performing vehicles, as well as the need to optimize production and streamline supply chains and logistics, is also spiking. One technology that is helping to meet these challenges is 3D printing. 3D printing technology is being explored across all areas of automotive production. Aside from its extensive use for rapid prototyping, the technology is also being used to produce tooling and end parts.

This peak holiday season will be unlike any before, and brands must adapt accordingly. These unusual circumstances need to be met with creative solutions to ensure customer experiences do not skip a beat.
Among the many issues plaguing retailers this peak holiday season is the conundrum of last-mile delivery. With expected carrier delays due to increased ecommerce volume and surging transportation costs, retail brands must find a strategy to remedy this problem.
Aside from ordering an item online, delivery is the only other direct touchpoint a consumer will have with your brand. Variables such as carrier delays or transportation costs will be associated with your company if they negatively impact shoppers this holiday season. In this article, I will walk through a few ways to avoid this scenario by looking at alternative last-mile delivery options that will keep both consumers and brands happy.
Shortened Supply Chain: Pop-Ups or Micro Fulfillment
By reducing transit time for goods as much as possible, brands can remove much of the uncertainty involved in last mile delivery. This helps to solve two big problems many brands are facing this peak holiday season: Shipping delays and increased transportation costs.
With expected ecommerce volume at three times normal capacity, carriers are expected to experience delays in delivery times. Additionally, many are adding holiday surcharges based on distance, volume and proximity to the holidays.
To avoid these negative scenarios, retail brands should embrace alternative options like micro-fulfillment. This shortens the supply chain by dispersing product across various micro or pop-up distribution centers. Thus, transportation distances and shipping costs are decreased. Brands can leverage their existing infrastructure in new ways while delivering an optimal fulfillment experience for the holidays. This is crucial as over 700 million holiday packages are at risk of not arriving on time, according to Salesforce.
A New Application for the Gig Economy
Another solution this holiday season is tapping into the gig economy. Ridesharing platforms like Uber and Lyft, as well as food delivery apps DoorDash and Postmates, have risen as viable solutions to the last-mile delivery dilemma.
Many of these platforms already have a robust food delivery complement, so applying the same strategy to ecommerce fulfillment is a natural progression based on current market demands. This is a trend to watch as this holiday season will serve as a great litmus test for the role of the gig economy in last-mile delivery moving forward.
Shoppers should not be surprised if their packages are dropped off by a ridesharing platform as opposed to the typical carrier truck. The gig economy offers a more agile delivery solution and helps to localize the supply chain even further.
Expanding BOPIS and Curbside Capabilities
For shoppers who are disappointed in recent brick-and-mortar retail closings, the next best thing is a great experience with Buy Online, Pickup in Store (BOPIS). Shoring up curbside pickup should be a key priority for brands this peak holiday season and into 2021.
This option is safe for consumers and eliminates issues with transportation delays and surcharges. However, omnichannel brands must streamline their supply chains to make expanding curbside a viable plan. This includes ensuring products are dispersed proportionately across geographies and offering inventory transparency to shoppers across sales channels. This creates an urgency to buy and also lets consumers know when they can pick up items at various locations nearest to them.
As we dive further into the 2020 holidays, retailers will be constantly faced with new challenges. By tapping into alternative fulfillment options, you can offset some of these variables and in turn deliver great experiences for shoppers. Especially this year, the success of your last-mile delivery is critical to winning during peak holiday season, so you can’t afford to leave anything to chance.

ARK believes that vertical integration through a ride-hail network would:
De-risk Tesla’s financial model;Lay the operational foundation for its robotaxi network; andIncrease the odds that its robotaxi initiative will succeed.
ARK believes that a ride-hail network will enhance Tesla’s profitability prior to the launch of a robotaxi service. Moreover, it seems that the launch of a robotaxi service would not tie up significant engineering resources except for routing, payment integration, and other functions that will be critical to the launch of robotaxis.
Finally, a vertically integrated ride-hail service with highly utilized electric vehicles would increase the share of miles driven on electric platforms, advancing Tesla’s mission of converting the world to sustainable energy.
De-Risk the Financial Model
While the launch of a commercial robotaxi business should transform Tesla’s profitability radically, its technical feasibility is somewhat uncertain. ARK previously detailed how a robotaxi service could increase Tesla’s valuation by 10x, though in our published base case valuation we assigned only a 30% probability to its success.
Pursuing a vertically integrated ride-hail service, Tesla could unlock the benefits of a robotaxi-like financial model and at the same time lower considerably the technical risk of launching a robotaxi network. For the first 3 million cars sold into the ride-hail channel, ARK believes that Tesla would generate net profits per mile close to that of an autonomous robotaxi service. As shown below, a vertically integrated ride-hail service priced in line with existing services like Uber and Lyft should generate 28 cents of profit per mile. While ARK expects the price-per-mile of a robotaxi network to decline over time, without the expense of human drivers and with the increased convenience and value profile for consumers,  its profitability still should be similar to that of ride-hail services, as shown below.

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon.
Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2020
According to ARK’s research, while the addressable market of a robotaxi network is 100x larger than that of a ride-hail service, Tesla would generate recurring profitability earlier and more predictably were it to launch both services. ARK’s modeling suggests that in 2025 ride-hail could increase Tesla’s recurring operating earnings by over $30 billion, bolstering its valuation relative to that for its standalone EV business. If Tesla were to decide against the commercial launch of robotaxis, then a ridehail service alone could improve its profitability and ultimately account for roughly 30% of the company’s enterprise value by ARK’s estimates.
Lay the Operational Foundation for the Robotaxi Network
The operational requirements for vertically integrated ride-hail services are similar to those for commercial robotaxi systems, as shown below. To commercialize its robotaxi network, Tesla will have to integrate payments, develop routing and matching algorithms for riders and drivers, recruit and train vehicle-owners to join the platform, concentrate fleet assets in target markets, and attract prospective riders. Each of those capabilities would be necessary to support a ride-hail service as well, so why would Tesla wait until Full-Self-Driving software to develop them?

Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2020
Not all the preparation for a vertically integrated ridehail service would add value to Tesla’s robotaxi initiative. Notably, Tesla would have to develop sales and recruitment strategies for a ride-hail service on a city-by-city basis. Though it could attract drivers to its platform, the startup costs probably would exceed those of launching a robotaxi service.
That said, while drivers would be committing to a platform aiming ultimately to disintermediate their driving services, they also would be investing in an asset—a vehicle—that would appreciate, in our view meaningfully, when converted to a robotaxi. Drivers would become vehicle operators, with incentives to keep their vehicles clean, charged, and utilized.
Increase the Odds of Robotaxi Success
While Tesla could launch a ride-hail service on time, the robotaxi landscape is littered with missed timelines and false starts. Many auto manufacturers once expected to launch truly driverless capabilities by 2020 but not one delivered on time. Even Waymo, the Alphabet subsidiary supposedly two months from commercial launch in November 2018, delayed its launch by roughly two years. Tesla also has slipped on its timelines, suggesting that the technical challenge associated with autonomous driving is daunting.
That said, we believe Tesla does have a significant competitive advantage: it can source real-world driving data and deploy real-world tests of its autonomous system at scale. Tesla’s fleet – all of the Model S’s, 3’s, X’s, and Y’s equipped with Autopilot on roads today – drives more miles in a day than Waymo’s fleet does in a year.[1] Tesla can collect more real-world examples of idiosyncratic faults or corner cases more quickly than can Waymo and then can battle test solutions against real-world conditions across roughly one million vehicles.
While ARK believes Tesla already has access to more driving data than any company in the world, ride-hail miles could be even more valuable to Tesla as they would mimic the future trips taken in robotaxis. A ride-hail network would give Tesla significantly more data to train Autopilot. Based on traditional car-driving habits, ARK estimates that Tesla will have access to more than 40 million miles of driving data per day by the end of 2020. According to our estimates, ride-hail could boost its annual real-world driving data generation by roughly 70% by 2025, as shown below.
Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2020
As a result, Tesla will have access to more corner cases as it trains its autonomous neural nets, potentially solving for full autonomy sooner than would otherwise be the case. More real-world driving data also will be critical in convincing regulators that Tesla’s autonomous system is safe. To demonstrate that the performance of its autonomous vehicles is statistically superior to that of human drivers, ARK believes Tesla will have to provide regulators with billions of miles of data. Ride-hailing miles could shave months and perhaps years from the time and data collection necessary for regulatory approval.
In the next year, given the number of Uber and Lyft drivers in need of work after the coronavirus crisis juxtaposed against the increased consumer demand for transport options other than mass transit, a Tesla ride-hail network could be well-timed.  Today, approximately 13 million US gig workers are collecting unemployment benefits in the wake of the coronavirus, and subway usage is down nearly 70% in New York City.  Ride-hailing also could provide free marketing focused on potential Tesla buyers, particularly in urban areas. Consequently, a ride-hail network could benefit not only Tesla’s bottom line but also serve public needs both during and after the pandemic.

 Radical transparency is the key to building lasting customer relationships that result in satisfaction and repeat business. 

The delivery experience is a critical part of the overall customer experience. It is where the rubber meets the road and where retailers’ or wholesalers’ true colors showl.
In many ways, Amazon has set the bar for the delivery experience. But, those who deliver big and bulky goods need to go beyond what Amazon offers. Consumers have come to expect rapid and high-precision delivery, and bring those expectations with them across specialty and work-related deliveries. They need to be able to select narrow delivery slots that fit their schedules, and trust that goods will arrive when promised.
There is no better way to build that trust than to offer radical transparency. When customers know how their goods are progressing on a delivery commitment, they feel calm and empowered.
Being opaque, however, has its benefits, as it offers the ability to conceal operational shortcomings and mistakes from the end-customer. Not every organization is ready for radical transparency, and there are considerations to be made before making the change. Preparation begins with the following three considerations.
1. Last-mile logistics is about customer experience
The sooner shippers begin to treat last mile as a part of the customer experience, the better. Customers want to know where their delivery is and how it tracks against the promised time window. There are a few key components that need to come into play in order to do so:
●     Flexible, multi-choice delivery dates and times.
●      Consistent follow-through, on time and without error.
●      Regular communication and order tracking.
●      Visibility down to the driver level.
Timely, effective communication to customers about last-mile delivery is more complicated than it sounds. Where notifications are concerned, some systems are limited in capabilities, or are too aggressive and can burden a consumer with irrelevant or excessive updates. The best software balances direct communication with customers by being transparent at critical moments in the fulfillment process, e.g., a scheduling prompt after purchase, when an order arrives at the warehouse, a reminder before the day of delivery and so on.                                                                                  
Also, the human trust factor is inherent to long-term successful system adoption should not be forgotten. The software must be user friendly with enough depth to do the job yet allow new users to feel “in control.” Dispatchers care deeply about their customers and how their brand is represented and will only continue using software that they trust will deliver predictable results.
2. Transparency can be risky if not prepared
Companies that struggle with on-time delivery and precision across deliveries need to consider solutions to internal issues before providing radical transparency. Sharing increased visibility leaves little room for error and companies need to be prepared to put their best foot forward.
Understanding key pain points such as driver compliance, late delivery or long delivery windows and inconsistency across the third-party logistics (3PL) provider is essential to making adjustments. A driver app that provides a digital way to dispatch orders, driving directions, GPS tracking, frictionless communications with customers and easy documentation of deliveries is necessary to ensure driver adoption and proper use.
 High-precision routing is key to managing variables such as traffic, weather, directions and more to provide the most efficient and accurate delivery routes, so that drivers can meet customer time windows every time and companies can even narrow windows. Lastly, the software utilized must be seamlessly integrated by 3PL partners to ensure that customer experience is consistent.
3. Customer communication is key
Considering what modern customers expect, companies will find that consistent, accurate communication is central to meeting those needs. Customers need to know where their delivery is, and how it is tracking vs. the promised delivery slot. By providing this in real-time, companies can make last-mile logistics into a customer experience advantage. By ensuring that communication systems are in place that allows for real-time updates that are easily accessible for customers and often provided by automated systems or drivers.
Consistent on-time performance is important, but issues and mistakes will happen, and radical transparency can help to make the most of even less-than-ideal circumstances. Sometimes radical transparency means telling customers you’ll be delayed. The benefit to this communication is that it allows customers to adjust their expectations and plans, which will ultimately lead to a better overall experience, even when things don’t go as planned.
There is no better way to build trust than to offer radical transparency. When customers know how you are progressing toward delivering on your commitments, they can feel calm. And, worst case, if you are running late, they can adjust their plans.
Ultimately, radical transparency is the key to building lasting customer relationships that result in satisfaction and repeat business. This level of visibility is not easy to achieve and takes planning, consistency and ongoing effort to maintain. Shippers have the opportunity to provide a customer experience that goes beyond the point of purchase and continues through the last mile by expanding comfortability with radical transparency.

The autonomous mobility industry is tackling part of the last-mile problem that many commuters encounter when using public transportation by replacing large, diesel buses with a fleet of electric, self-driving shuttle buses that transport small groups of people along defined and planned routes. Autonomous shuttles could be a key element that connects the public transportation systems to reduce private car ownership in the future. The autonomous shuttle total market size will be over $18 billion by 2040, according to IDTechEx’s report “Robot Shuttles and Autonomous Buses 2020-2040.”
What are autonomous shuttles?
Autonomous shuttles are upright, boxy, 8-20 person vehicles that are symmetrical so they never do a U-turn. Small footprint, all-round vision, large doors, quiet, zero-emission, they can go indoors and over piazzas and roads and are able to perform many different tasks even in one day. Primarily intended for intensive urban use, they are gated to never exceed a determined speed, typically in the range 50kmph – 60kmph.It all adds up to a new form of transport backed by both huge companies like Toyota and Baidu and start-ups alike. Their trials explore many possible applications, from empowering the poor and disabled, to viably filling in gaps in the transportation network and replacing very underutilized vehicles such as school buses and private cars, reducing congestion and cost. In IDTechEx’s new report “Electric, Hybrid and Fuel Cell Buses 2021-2040” the major players developing autonomous shuttles are profiled. We summarise a selection of these companies below. While true level 4 autonomy does not currently exist, most companies discussed are at “level 4” in geofenced or controlled areas. 
NAVYA
NAVYA is a French company founded in 2014 with more than 270 employees in France and the US. The company filed for IPO in Euronext Paris in July 2018 with 80 million euro ($94 million) financing and the company achieved 19 million euro ($22 million) revenues in 2018. The AUTONOM SHUTTLE, launched in 2015, is designed for a low-speed environment where there is a high frequency of travel. Currently, it is still operated at Level 3 autonomy where on-board safety operators are required. The shuttle is dedicated to the first and last-mile transportation and can carry up to 15 people. The shuttle is suitable for underserved areas where full-sized buses might not be justified from a ridership standpoint, or areas that are too tight to get around. The shuttles can operate on open roads in cities or private sites such as campuses, business parks, airports, industrial parks and hospitals – anywhere where people are taking lots of trips from half a mile up to two miles. NAVYA’s strategy is to build small autonomous shuttles with a $300,000+ price that can be amortized over time by municipalities, campuses and large corporate parks working on smart city projects.
EasyMile
EasyMile is a French high-tech start-up founded in 2014 with over 180 employees. The main product, EZ10, was designed from the ground for autonomous driving (no steering wheel). The EZ10 was launched in 2015 and 110 units have been sold to date. The company is generating some revenues (relatively small) from selling the shuttles. Apart from selling the EZ10 shuttles, the company also licenses its in-house autonomous driving software to other companies.
2getthere
2getthere is a spin-off company of Frog Navigation Systems, which was founded in 1984 to deliver automated guided vehicles (AGVs) to factories. The company became an independent company focused on autonomous vehicles for passenger transport in 2007, with a HQ in the Netherlands and was acquired by ZF Group, a German auto parts maker, in March 2019, which is one of the largest automotive suppliers. Its business model is to sell the complete transportation system: vehicles and operation systems including a supervision system for fleet management, passenger interface, charging infrastructure and communication infrastructure.
Baidu
The Chinese tech giant Baidu was founded in 2000 and specializes in internet-related services and products, and AI. The company started development of autonomous vehicles in 2013. The company has negotiated 50 partners to sign up for the development and purchase of the new autonomous buses Apolong. The volume production of the autonomous minibus Apolong is in partnership with Chinese vehicle manufacturer King Long who designs and manufactures the vehicle. In July 2018, Baidu announced its 100th Apolong, marking its ability to commercialize its autonomous shuttle buses.
Yutong
Yutong is a Chinese manufacturer of commercial vehicles, especially electric buses, headquartered in Zhengzhou, Henan. As of 2016, it was the largest bus manufacturer in the world by sales volume. Yutong showcased their pure electric shuttle in March 2019 during a forum in Hainan, China, transporting attendees at the conference venue. 
The autonomous shuttle integrates the U-Drive AI platform developed by UISEE, which uses sensor fusion and deep learning algorithms as well as a cloud-based vehicle management system. The 5m-long shuttle has 8 seats and can go up to 40km/h in a closed environment. The shuttle is equipped with a set of sensors including 3 lidars, radars, cameras and ultrasonics. In May 2019, Yutong started a pilot project on 5G intelligent transportation, running 5 shuttles on an island district in Zhengzhou in collaboration with China Unicom and China Mobile. The tested district is covered with 5G and has a dedicated lane for autonomous shuttles.

Autonomous vehicles have been on a path to widespread availability and adoption for some time. But this technology is now moving forward much faster than most people realize.
Both Tesla and General Motors this fall made news with their fully autonomous vehicle efforts. Tesla CEO Elon Musk in September said the test version of its fully self-driving Autopilot system would be released in “a month or so.” Less than a month later, Tesla revealed plans to offer a limited number of drivers a beta of this capability. Around the same time, GM announced plans to launch a test of unmanned autonomous vehicles by the end of this year in San Francisco.
Meanwhile, Google Waymo and Volkswagen are moving ahead with self-driving commercial truck efforts. Some companies are working on using automated follower trucks in the platooning of multiple trucks, too. This can entail having a human at the wheel of the lead truck only. Peloton Technology and Locomation expect automated following to scale quickly and more broadly.
The autonomous vehicle will be just as disruptive as the horseless carriage
The future of the autonomous vehicle is now. And I believe that this new generation of vehicle will be as disruptive today as the first horseless carriages were in the horse-and-buggy era.
I know about this topic because I’m an automotive historian, specializing in the 1886-1913 period. I’ve written several articles for collector car magazines. And I’ve read almost every book ever written on how disruptive motorized vehicles were. And I expect this to happen again.- Advertisement –
So, fasten your seatbelts because big change is on the way. I believe that in about 20 years non-autonomous cars will be outlawed. If people like me want to drive their classic cars, they’re going to have to put those vehicles on trailers, take them to tracks, and drive them there.
This is happening whether we like it or not – and will drive widespread change
I invested $100 to reserve a Tesla Cyber Truck with a fully autonomous system. But some people say they’ll never use an autonomous vehicle. But I truly believe that we will not have a choice in the matter at some point in the not-too-distant future. I say that because if every car on the road can communicate with the other vehicles, the propensity for accidents is going to be greatly reduced because it removes that human factor of the distracted driver.
Autonomous cars will also improve traffic flow. That could create efficiencies in road construction. In Los Angeles we have roads that are 16 lanes wide, and that’s still not enough.
And in the very near future, we will not own cars, we will subscribe to them. There are already companies offering vehicle subscriptions, including a business called Cocoon. Today we have to get the car. With autonomous vehicles, we’ll be able to summon a car, and it will come to us.
The move to subscriptions will impact our homes and yards as well. We won’t need big garages, so we’ll be able to use that space for extra rooms. We won’t necessarily even need driveways.
Autonomous vehicles need to be safe and secure regardless of class
The way government and industry rate and regulate vehicle safety will also need to change.
What if someone asked you: What is the safest car in America? You can’t answer that because it’s a trick question. The reason it’s a trick question is because safety is dependent on class. If you want the safest car in America, you’re going have to buy something like a Mercedes SUV. But most people can’t afford that. So, the safety commission provides safety rankings by class.
However, when it comes to the autonomous vehicles, every vehicle must have the exact same safety or security protocol to be successful. This is the reality regardless of whether the vehicle is a Toyota Tercel, or some other subcompact car, or the most expensive Mercedes.
Yet there’s no way that automakers can rely on consumers to keep in-car security systems current. It’s simple to put gas in a car, but people still run out of gas. Imagine what will happen when people get reports that they need to update security certificates in their cars and that if they don’t those vehicles are no longer secure. Are they all going to immediately drive to their dealership to have that security certificate updated? It’s just not going to happen. It is for this reason that consumers won’t purchase cars and the responsibility for maintaining the security will fall to subscription fleet operators.
The rise of driverless vehicles is converging safety and security
Autonomous vehicles are changing how we need to think about and address safety and security. Today there’s a big difference between safety and security. But in the coming era of autonomous vehicles, there will be no difference between the two.
Now the focus is on employing physical measures like airbags, crumple zones and seat belts to address safety. All vehicle safety features are based on the survivability of an accident, not intentional harm. No one ever thinks about security of a car, short of a car getting stolen.
But as autonomous vehicles become mainstream, electronic security becomes more important.
In a scene in “The Fate of the Furious” movie, Charlize Theron says “make it rain.” This prompts her techie coworkers in the room to remotely control vehicles in a parking garage. They use this control to drive those cars off the edge of the parking garage into a heap on the street below. If this were possible, that would be the end of the autonomous vehicle market altogether.
The public will accept accidents, such as an autonomous car running a stop light. But we will not, as a society, accept situations in which people intentionally run cars into walls or off cliffs or buildings. That’s why the security of fully autonomous vehicles is of paramount importance.
Public key infrastructure and hardware security modules can provide the needed protection
Automakers, component makers and security companies like us are already working on this. In fact, our work on security for autonomous vehicles has been in development for a long time.
The automotive industry has selected public key infrastructure (PKI) to secure autonomous vehicles. PKI, a proven way to secure digital systems, provides security using a pair of cryptographic keys. Public and private keys work together to secure the manufacturing and updates to cars and their components. But it is the private key that acts as the PKI root of trust.
In the case of autonomous vehicles, the private key lives in the car or with the manufacturer. If a hacker compromises the private key, that hacker can gain control of the car and override its programming. So, it’s important to keep the private key safe and secure at all costs.
You could store the private key in an application server. But that’s dangerous because perimeter security is your only safeguard, and hackers frequently breech “secure” perimeters.
Hardware security modules (HSMs), used during the manufacturing process and maintained by the manufacturer throughout the cars’ lifecycle, are a more effective way to secure PKI systems and keys. HSMs are specialized appliances that hold and secure cryptographic keys. They are widely used and serve as the ultimate root of trust for a range of applications and systems. Without an HSM, cryptographic keys are at high risk of compromise. This a large and growing problem since encryption keys are going to be in every car going forward. And it’s why using HSMs for autonomous vehicle security infrastructure should become an industry standard.
HSMs may seem a small detail, but going without them can have big repercussions
I see the cryptographic key as akin to the horseshoe nail. If you’re not securing that one little piece, you could run the risk of everything else getting compromised. And that risk is only growing as time progresses since computer systems are becoming faster and their ability to crack crypto is getting stronger. But if you are safeguarding your systems using PKI and HSMs, you can keep those systems, autonomous cars, and the people who use them safe and secure.

As the coronavirus continues to spread throughout the world, more and more people are staying home in an effort to contain the outbreak. With brick-and-mortar stores shutting down and people being asked to remain indoors, individuals are increasingly resorting to online deliveries.
A recent analysis conducted by Adobe shows that e-commerce purchases of hand sanitizers, gloves, masks and antibacterial sprays surged by 817% during the month of February 2020, and it’s likely that other product categories will follow suit.
To meet new demands brought on by the virus, retailers need to make sure they’re delivering a superior customer experience. It will be defined by proactive communication about the status of shipments, as well as fast delivery.
Using sensors enabled by the internet of things (IoT), retailers can keep tabs on shipment whereabouts and conditions, enabling proactive communications to customers about the status of their orders. Here’s how IoT can aid in tracking and monitoring efforts during this critical time.
Accurate Location Tracking
Because shipments become more critical as people stay home to avoid the virus, customer expectations of on-time delivery are even higher than before. By turning to IoT-enabled devices, organizations can secure insight into shipment whereabouts that will help them keep customers up to date on delivery estimates and periodic location updates as they await their packages.
Data collected by IoT devices can also empower retailers to optimize shipment routes for faster delivery, improving operations and, again, bolstering the customer experience. Identifying warehouse delays, addressing weak links in the supply chain, and driving overall efficiencies are additional benefits of deploying IoT.
With the virus spreading, such information could become lifesaving. Perhaps a supplier notices that on a particular route, its shipments are hitting a snag in the supply chain, causing a delivery delay. By applying machine-learning techniques to data collected using IoT devices, the supplier can avoid that route moving forward, and accelerate the delivery of critical items such as gloves and face masks.
Conditions Monitoring
In addition to tracking shipment location, container conditions must be considered. By collecting, computing and delivering updates on the environmental state of containers, IoT-enabled sensors can instill confidence that the enclosed goods are properly maintained.
This is especially important for providers of perishable or fragile items, as containers move from supplier to distributor to customer. For instance, the failure of a shipment containing pharmaceuticals or food to maintain proper temperature throughout its journey could lead to serious public health issues. Beyond tarnishing the seller’s brand reputation, it can cause potential health risks to customers who may have been depending on goods or medicine to get them through a shelter-in-place.
With IoT-enabled sensors, retailers can get ahead of these issues by securing continuous updates on container conditions, including temperature. Companies can take action to remedy any issues immediately, as well as detect where there are likely to be more broken processes down the road.
Global Connectivity
Tracking and monitoring containers can only be accomplished if IoT devices are connected to a global network and can deliver the insights needed to help retailers and customers stay up to date.
Organizations should consider turning to a 0G network to provide them with global connectivity. A 0G network is a low-power wide-area network that can transfer small amounts of data across long ranges. It differs from other connectivity options in that it transmits data — pertaining to location or temperature, for example — at a lower cost than that of traditional IoT providers, but without sacrificing quality. In addition, because the device consumes smaller amounts of power, battery life is longer and more predictable. This means IoT-enabled devices won’t die during the shipment journey across the globe, so retailers can secure and communicate real-time updates.
With greater visibility up and down the supply chain, organizations can set themselves on the path to operational efficiency, superior customer experiences, and a healthy bottom line. Whether retailers are adjusting to evolving demands stemming from the coronavirus, or trying to maintain their competitive standing, IoT can provide the insights needed to adjust course, while still delivering exceptional service at an affordable price.

Autonomous, or self-driving cars will make driving safer, smarter and more efficient. Equipped with Internet connections, often wireless local area networks, self-driving cars will be able to speak to each other and the environment around them.
One feature allows the cars to keep their distance and synchronise braking to avoid accidents. Autonomous cars will include features such as lane assist, collision avoidance and automatic calls to emergency services to create a safer driving experience. Some automotive brands are taking automation a step further, innovating to enable vehicles to communicate with nearby infrastructure and even pedestrians, adding a new dimension to how automation can benefit society.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) believes that the right technology infrastructure is critical for the production of these vehicles, which require high-performance computing capacity, seamless cybersecurity and the ability to manage vast data sets. Here are some of the key reasons why many organisations are turning to the cloud to develop and deploy autonomous cars at scale:
Training and testing
Autonomous cars strive to create vehicles that operate more safely than humans. Delivering on this ambition requires extensive modelling and testing. The ability to collect, store and manage data is critical, as are advanced Machine Learning techniques.
Toyota Research Institute (TRI) believes that accurately training autonomous cars requires trillions of miles of testing. To deliver on this, it has a fleet of test cars equipped with Light Direction and Ranging (Lidar) Sensors to record data, collecting terabytes of data every day, needing quick retrieval and analyses. 
TRI uses AWS to manage this data and access the processing power required to train Machine Learning models quickly. Using cloud infrastructure, it has gained the ability to spin up compute and storage resources on demand and blend these with management and orchestration services. TRI now retrains vehicle models, increases accuracy and introduces new features faster. By following similar models, more automotive businesses will accelerate the development of safer cars.
Edging forward
Enabling autonomous cars to make rapid, data-driven decisions will make our roads safer. These machines need backing by reliable infrastructure with low latency and high availability. They also need to analyze information in real time, including data on road conditions, weather and the behavior of other vehicles. Applying AI allows the car to react swiftly and safely to road conditions.
Edge Computing allows this core in-car technology to perform its in-car data crunching. When a second of lag can make the difference between a safe or dangerous response, autonomous vehicles do not have the luxury of waiting for data processing in the cloud. Therefore, organisations need to look for cloud providers with integrated edge solutions. These allow analysis of mission-critical data at the source and reducing the cost of transmitting additional data to the cloud.
Security in the cloud
Cybersecurity is important when developing safety-focused autonomous cars. Each vehicle becomes a new endpoint which must be secured. Protection from hackers and malware must be a top priority to ensure they cannot gain access to driving controls or the data that runs through each vehicle.
Autonomous car producers are turning to the cloud in order to support and run connected cars. AWS delivers automated security services which apply Machine Learning to proactively manage tasks including security assessments, threat detection and policy management. By having security baked in, manufacturers can be confident that they have the solutions in place to detect new and emerging vulnerabilities and threats which will reduce harm to drivers and lower the risk of a breach.
Autonomous cars are our future; however to drive adoption, manufacturers must ensure they are secure and supported by robust infrastructure. With the right cloud infrastructure, organisations are able to focus their resources on building differentiated automotive experiences, rather than managing IT infrastructure.

Orlando strives to be a world-class city by finding ways to improve things, such as transportation.
One of those efforts underway is the Future-Ready City Master Plan, which proposes a longterm strategy for implementing new programs and policies to advance mobility, digital connectivity, energy, health and safety, placemaking such as housing, water conservation and materials such as recycling. The plan has been in the works since 2019, and may play a role in helping improve daily commutes for thousands of Orlando workers who rely on mass transit.
Improving how workers get around town is vital to the region — especially helping workers cover what experts call the “tricky” first and last miles of their trips. For example, in Seminole and Orange counties, 41% of residents live more than three-quarters of a mile from a Lynx bus stop, according to the Central Florida Regional Transit Authority, which oversees the Lynx public bus system. That hurdle causes undue stress to workers and can hurt productivity.
The Future-Ready City plan tackles various aspects of transportation, including finding ways to incentivize more use of mass transit via rewards for users. That can be in the form of gift cards that may help make traveling for commuters more rewarding and help offset other costs in their daily lives. Other initiatives are to implement more data synchronization where users can have more precise information on the locations of buses and rail times, as well as simplifying the payment systems for those different entities into one simple platform.
The goal of Orlando’s Future-Ready plan will help make those residents’ lives a little easier, Michael Hess, director of Future Ready for the city, told Orlando Business Journal. The plan will take some time to integrate as it’s all very new, but the potential is there, he added.
“There’s a bunch of different data initiatives in the transportation space that have been evolving over the last few years where we actually can see Lynx bus locations real time. Those technology hurdles are still a little painful to do that integration, but it’s evolving. Picture if you are doing a trip that involves both Lynx bus and SunRail and you can see real time: ‘I’m on the train right now, when is my train going to get to the station and where is the bus and when will that get to the station. Am I going to make it?’ So hopefully, it makes it easier for everyone.”
Here, Hess shares some specifics of the future-ready plan that may ease transportation for commuters or encourage the use of mass transit while making it more affordable:
How did you account for working-class commuters for the plan? We engaged the community when we were developing this plan. Earlier this year, we did a lot of community meetings in each district. We had a lot of the general public attend community workshops, so when we built this plan, we allowed the community to tell us what issues they saw and what ideas they had to solve those issues. Working with our consultant VHB and other experts, we [shared[ ideas we saw in other cities and allowed our residents to vote.
How will the incentive system work? There are apps you already can use that act as a frequent flier program and will reward you. What we are looking to do is partner with some of those companies to feed out very specific challenges to help with our city issues. Those technology providers will have their standard rewards programs. By partnering with those companies, the city can issue challenges. For example, if we wanted to increase use of scooter share or walking or SunRail and Lymmo, we can push out challenges that offer gift cards — a $5 gift card if you ride SunRail four times this week. That’s the area we are looking to add in to push alternative transit that will help the city of Orlando.
Can that incentive system eventually include regional partners like free SunRail rides? It can. It starts to get harder to do because you need to have multiple regional entities coordinating. This first year we will focus on challenges with gift cards, and if it’s successful, we will start to further our partnerships with SunRail and others to offer those rewards. We will get there, but in this first year we will keep it simple.
What other metros did you see have success with a reward-style program? We did research of Smart City technology all across the world. We want to be out front and think we will be because we made this comprehensive plan that others haven’t. The city of Sacramento, California, has been doing a rewards program for over a year now, and Jacksonville Transit Authority just started doing a rewards program maybe a month or two ago. Also, CalTrain, [the commuter rail] out in California, has been doing this type of approach. Some of the ones from California started to show the amount of money they invested in rewards, they exceeded that in additional revenue by encouraging people to ride. We’ve seen success in California and want to try in Orlando if we can translate that success here.
What’s the strategy behind the single payment system? That’s one of our mid-term strategies, probably a couple of years out, related to a short-term strategy around trying to use technology to better integrate all our mobility options so anyone can see what their different options are to get from Point A to Point B. Is there an easy way to jump on a Lynx bus to get to SunRail or SunRail to a scooter? Right now that’s very siloed. You have to look at the SunRail map separately and go to the Lynx app or website to see what they have, and that creates friction in the system. So the single payment piece will be built on top of that to make it easier for people to use alternative forms of transit to make it more frictionless. The people who use it every day, we might save them a little time. We hope if we can make it easier, we can expand ridership and then expand routes.
When can we expect to see the single payment portion of the plan? As we go through the budgeting process, we will reprioritize projects, continue to talk the community, look at the city budget and prioritize accordingly every year. The single payment side is mid-term. But short-term, we want to build the platform where you can see the information n one place and then that will be platform you can build on and put in the payment system and build the features over time. It will be a multiyear project.
How important will this plan be for the working class that doesn’t have a car? Extremely important. If you look at the foundational elements of this plan and some of the common themes we heard form community engagement, a lot was around equity and inclusion. When we were picking this strategy, those foundational elements were part of our prioritization process. We specifically wanted to pick strategies that would help everyone, not just trying to buy some shiny technology that only helps a few. We are extremely focused on having everything we do help with equity and inclusion.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is everywhere, particularly in our homes from voice assistants and smart bulbs to thermostats that learn user preferences and habits. But what the hype, hoopla and smart refrigerators don’t tell you is that IoT will actually pave the way to a much more interconnected world. It’s more than a watch counting steps and miles – IoT is about a connectivity revolution. It allows for unprecedented convenience and ushers in a new era of innovations.
A world of intelligence
Today’s smart home consists of voice-activated devices that can interface with some items and appliances but it’s only the start of what’s to come. In the not-too-distant future, everything in your home will be connected not only for simple commands but for intuitive solutions that intelligently react without the need for user input.
Freshly brewed coffee – a frequently cited feature of the smart home and IoT – is just the beginning. For example, when connected to a smart oven, a smartphone would know when its user wakes up and automatically begin the preheating process. This could be done without any form of privacy invasion. The oven would know when the alarm is scheduled to ring. It would then wait for confirmation – through an app or by detecting when the alarm is turned off – before preheating. This would make it easy to pop in a frozen croissants for a quick breakfast before work.
At the same time, a smart thermostat could automatically adjust to compensate for the increase in heat from the oven or lights could automatically turn on as well, but only in rooms that are about to be entered. Knowing when it’s almost time to leave for work, a connected car could automatically open the garage and start its engine. If left outside in the snow, the vehicle would know to start even sooner, providing enough time for icy windshields to melt and clear before it’s time to leave. The possibilities are endless and really show the power of a truly connected world.
Driving toward the future
IoT is going to have a big impact on mobility, but it will start long before fully autonomous vehicles are on our roads. As smart cities come online, drivers will gain access to more than real-time traffic information – they’ll know exactly which roads provide the fastest route. Traffic signal details will be sent directly to the car, which will share them with the driver.
 The car’s own details (such as speed and location) will be sent back to the traffic signal, allowing the two to the interface. Then, if north and southbound traffic is light but eastbound traffic is picking up, the signal could automatically adjust to compensate, extending the green light for the greatest number of drivers.
When cars are capable of driving themselves, IoT-infused features would be taken to a whole other level. Instead of merely providing all of the smart city information to the driver, that info would go directly to the vehicle, which would take the most efficient, time-saving route to and from work.
Autonomous vehicles will allow occupants to use the commute to do whatever they want, and those things could be carried over when returning home. If watching a movie, for example, it could be instantaneously transferred (from a device or in-car display) to a living room TV, allowing the viewer to resume with the press of a single button.
Shop smarter than ever before
One of the most exciting parts of IoT is how it will transform the world of retail. Right now, it’s easy to walk into a store and leave without one of the key items you came to get. Maybe the items were misplaced or you simply forgot them. In any case, this will inevitably lead to an extra trip back to the store.
With IoT, each item could have an RFID (radio-frequency identification) tag that pings your phone as soon as you approach. Many stores already use these tags for security purposes or in their warehouses, so why not expand on this functionality? Grocery stores could install LED signs that flash not only for sales but for items added to your shopping list. Additionally, imagine the power of a retailer that uses large screens to highlight items that customers recently viewed online. Sensors could connect with each shopper’s phone to view their store history and tailor the displayed items accordingly. This would bring one of the best components of dot-com shopping to physical retail.
Surely there may be concerns about consumer adoption. While smart thermostats have turned off some individuals over fears of privacy, smart meters – electric, water or gas – have caused a stir over the increase in radiofrequency exposure. Consumers have a right to be concerned about these potential issues and should absolutely insist that manufacturers rectify them before they are welcomed into our homes.
Other consumers are eager to be early adopters regardless, embracing technological innovations first and worrying about any possible consequences later. Both groups are important to the future of technology: the latter allows innovations to flourish, the former ensures that they are refined and improved to meet all consumer needs.
Some subtle innovations are already being deployed to great effect, bringing retail into the 21st century. But it’s not just what you buy and how you find it in store – the future also involves how you pay and exit. One new concept, dubbed “just walk out,” allows consumers to buy whatever they want without ever having to wait in line for a cashier – Amazon Go has been trialing this with some success. In fact, checkouts have been eliminated entirely. 
Using a mix of smartphone technology, in-store sensors and artificial intelligence, “just walk out” is several steps above the self-checkout terminals that have been added to most retailers. As a smart store, the entire retail establishment can determine which items have been placed in a cart, as well as those that have been placed back on the shelf. This technology will only get better with time, providing even more opportunities for intelligent shopping experiences.
The Internet of absolutely everything
IoT is mentioned so frequently, it might come across as just another type of marketing speak. But there is truth to the hype, and there are no limits to what the “everything” in IoT will entail. There are also no limits to how consumers will respond. Some will inevitably worry about privacy or security.
 Others might be concerned about the possible health risks, such as those associated with smart meters. Whether or not these concerns are overblown remains to be seen, but that’s why tech makers must continue to be open and honest about how their technology works. The connectivity revolution depends on it – and the future growth of IoT demands it.

A mobile technology “arms race” is underway as companies re-imagine their supply chains, incorporate more mobility solutions into those networks, and work harder to future-proof their business models.
By Bridget McCrea 
Over the last few months, global supply chains have faced disruptions the likes of which most companies have never seen before.
Coming off of a year where labor shortages, an e-commerce boom, a shrinking pool of truck drivers, and trade wars were among their biggest challenges, shippers had a whole new set of issues hurled at them in early-2020.
With COVID-19 exacting a steep toll on human life, businesses, and livelihoods, some underlying supply chain issues became even more prominent. For example, e-commerce took off when people were at home or reluctant to shop at brick-and-mortar stores. Demand for buy online pick up in store (BOPIS) also accelerated, pushing retailers to get their collective “last-mile” and mobility acts together.
The good news is that the technology companies need to be able to operate efficiently in this “new normal” environment has been around for years. The not-so-good news is that many shippers were caught off guard by the pandemic and are now scrambling to implement solutions that help them gain better supply chain visibility and connectivity.
“The technology has always been there, but some companies are just further along and have been more innovative with it,” says David Krebs, executive vice president at VDC Research.
For example, COVID-19 accelerated the focus around driving visibility across operations and creating agile infrastructures. Combined, these two capabilities allow organizations to “more freely pivot,” says Krebs, “and leverage different fulfillment models.”
In response to market demand, technology vendors are introducing tools such as proximity solutions to alert workers when they’re not socially distancing—to the extent that this is even possible in certain work environments. “Education around disinfection best practices for shared technologies and devices has also been important,” Krebs points out. “The buzzword has clearly been ‘contactless,’ and we are seeing this pop up in all different scenarios and workflows—from delivery to point of sale.”
The connected fleet evolves
There was a time when shippers watched their goods leave their yards on a tractor trailer, lost visibility as they moved from point A to point B, and then picked visibility back up again when the trucks reached their final destination.
Fast forward to 2020 and the level of transportation visibility has vastly improved thanks to advancements in mobile technology. According to Bill Brooks, VP of Capgemini’s North American transportation portfolio, COVID has pushed more shippers to track their private and public fleets.
“COVID is basically driving a new norm as companies seek out ways to improve supply chain continuity in a safe manner that factors in everything that’s going on in our world right now,” says Brooks. “This trend is really going to take off over the next six to 18 months, with the connected fleet playing a huge part in that movement.”
Brooks sees data continuing to play a key role in supply chain mobility as companies focus on gathering, synthesizing, and utilizing their information. And while capturing and storing data is pretty straightforward, actually using it effectively isn’t always easy.
“As data continues to proliferate, companies have to do a better job of mining it, governing it, and getting it into the right hands at the right time,” says Brooks.
A multi-faceted animal, the connected fleet tracks everything from operational systems (i.e., preventative maintenance, hours of equipment usage, etc.), to accurate drive and ship times. It knows where any specific shipment is at all times and can convey that information back to the stakeholders who are asking for it.
More recently, companies have been incorporating elements of driver and employee safety into their connected fleets. If, for example, drivers know that they’re heading into a COVID hotspot, they can take the necessary precautions to help keep themselves, their shipments, or the end customer safe.
“The connected fleet takes a lot of those different elements and pulls them together onto a single platform,” says Brooks. “Technology vendors and shippers alike are getting innovative with their use of these connected fleets—versus just using them as pure tracking mechanisms.”
Today’s top mobility trends
According to VDC Research, overall investment in the warehousing space continues to grow and place pressure on optimized operations. The size and number of warehouses continue to rise, it says, as do the number of production and nonsupervisory employees in the warehouse along with their average hourly wages.
With 3.5 million warehouses currently operating globally, Krebs says the mobility trends taking place right now outside of their four walls include:
Decentralization of manufacturing capacity, with companies looking to bring production home. “This trend grew with the likes of automation and small batch production,” says Krebs.Global firms will diversify their supply chains in the future, instead of relying only on China. “Manufacturing hubs such as Vietnam, Mexico and India are likely to benefit from that shift,” he predicts.Traceability and serialization efforts to extend beyond pharmaceuticals and into fresh foods and other segments. For example, programs are being rolled out to match food service distributors with excess capacity food retailers and wholesalers that require additional resources.Continued capacity strain on last-mile delivery services. As more people shop from home, the “last-mile” simply can’t be a black hole in the supply chain anymore. Companies are using mobility solutions to gain visibility into this critical area.An accelerated push toward digital services and paperless processes. “This is also opening the door for example for blockchain solutions for supply chain,” says Krebs, “and especially in areas that have held centralized governance models.”Re-imagining forecasting algorithms and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to digitize inventory data. This trend accelerated when the global pandemic pushed the world’s supply chains and inventory stockpiles to their limits.Renewed focus on frontline workers. Ensuring the health and continuity of the food supply chain has shifted focus to a new class of “essential” workers. “As a result,” says Krebs, “supply chain security and workforce management are becoming ever more critical.”
Taking it to the air
Once considered something of a futuristic novelty, the airborne drone is proving its potential for the post-COVID, mobile supply chain—where contactless deliveries and social distancing are a normal part of our everyday lives.
Gartner predicts that by 2026, more than one million drones will be carrying out retail deliveries—up from 20,000 drones today. The global pandemic is a big driver of drone usage right now. For example, Zipline is using contactless drone delivery to transport COVID-19 test samples in remote locations across five African countries, and Chile recently launched a pilot drone program to deliver medications to people living in remote rural areas.
“The coronavirus pandemic has frozen much of the world’s aviation industry and grounded fleets,” Gartner states. “As a result, it has accelerated the use of autonomous flying drones in a humanitarian effort to beat the crisis.”
Beyond the pandemic, Gartner says that companies can consider autonomous flying drones as an opportunity to offer a premium service, like a fast-delivery option. For example, Spanish auto manufacturer SEAT uses drones to fly airbags and steering wheels from a supplier to its Martorell factory. A truck would take 90 minutes from order to delivery, but the drone can make it in just 15 minutes.
“Overall,” Gartner says, “the success of flying drone deliveries depends on a company’s ability to change its business model to make the most of the possibilities enabled by the technology.”
Get in the arms race now
Right now, the key requirement for supply chain operations is real-time visibility into operations and systems that can provide insight into capacity constraints across all supply tiers. This is often easier said than done, says Krebs, but it’s something shippers should be striving for.
Going forward, Krebs expects solutions that provide greater predictive intelligence to be in high demand, and especially solutions that can find patterns or indicate risk/opportunities. In addition, he says capacity strain on last-mile delivery is increasingly acute and an area of focus.
“Equipping essential frontline workers with the necessary digital and mobile tools to do their jobs and ensure worker safety are also areas where we see continued investment,” Krebs points out. “With e-commerce giants like Amazon continuing to build out their logistics infrastructure and becoming a more competitive threat to incumbents, we see a technology arms race developing.”
Getting in on that race will require an approach that thinks beyond what companies were doing just four or five years ago in this realm. Coming off an 11-year-long period of economic prosperity—and now re-imagining their business models for a post-COVID world—shippers are merging advanced technology tools with “lessons learned” to future-proof their supply chains.
“Embrace the change that’s coming and apply it to your new future and new norm,” Brooks advises. “In the end, it’s the companies that say: ‘Okay, if we do A, B and C we’ll be able to get out on the cutting edge,’ that will be more efficient, effective, and profitable.”

Mobility as a Service (MaaS) holds a lot of promise as a way to reduce the number of single occupancy vehicles on the road as well as address equity concerns. MaaS is a way to integrate different transportation options in order to facilitate coordinating trip and route planning, mode selection, and payment, according to Andy Boenau, leader of the MaaS initiative at engineering consulting firm Stantec.
Bicycles, scooters, on-call vans, and ride hailing apps, should be used to get people to and from major transit. A recent study from the American Public Transit Association (APTA) about MaaS in Europe , describes MaaS as “a full range of mobility options in a single digital mobility platform, leveraging public transportation as the network backbone.” Ideally, MaaS will eventually supersede personal cars in getting us “from any address in North America to any other address in North America,” said Boenau.
 Infrastructure that promotes transportation options such as a better bus system, conveniently located bikeshare and scooters, and walkability will make MaaS platforms more effective. Once fully operational, MaaS will provide the mobility and flexibility of an individual car without the expense, congestion and environmental impact.
This vision is different from the idea of autonomous vehicles on call to move each of us individually to all our destinations. A system with zero occupancy cars on the road that looks first to immediate, individual needs could induce more trips, sprawl, and congestion. Public transit can efficiently move large numbers of people and is a crucial element to include while working to achieve a sustainable transportation network.
Beyond level zero
How can different localities think about the implementation of Maas? A 2018 study by Jana Sochor et al. describes four levels of implementing MaaS. Level one includes multimodal planners, of which Google Maps is a rudimentary example; level two integrates booking and paying; level three has many layers, integrating a complete multimodal trip; and level four integrates policy goals, such as congestion charging. Sochor et al. point to “the need for decarbonization of the transport system, reduced congestion, innovation, and better accessibility” as important societal goals achieving a high level of MaaS will enable.
Most of North America is hovering around level zero, according to Chrissy Ditmore, Director of Strategy at Cubic Transportation Systems. Ditmore explained in a webinar that to move toward level one or two, the very first step for any transit agency is ensuring accurate real time information,. Simply having the scheduled time of arrival for a bus, for instance, won’t do, since if that bus is late it ruins the next step in the transit chain. It is also crucial to integrate with other agencies, such as metropolitan planning organizations, as transit agencies in isolation often lack the necessary authority. Public-private partnerships are also an important part of setting up a well-integrated MaaS system. Conversations between entities involved in MaaS need to happen as early as possible, as often as possible.
Two commonly discussed MaaS models are a monthly service charge for a full suite of services and a pay-as-you-go approach. The latter might incentivize customers to take the most efficient means of transportation, while a monthly fee might encourage overuse or the use of less efficient transportation choices. As a white paper by Cubic Transportation argues, “A pay-as-you-go model… is likely to encourage a more sustainable and denser use of transportation services.” The paper criticizes a subscription model as fundamentally flawed “given that the objective of MaaS must focus on improving the density of transit.”
Smart policy can also disincentivize single occupancy vehicle driving with a variety of tools such as “congestion pricing, parking regulation, land-use and traffic management policies,” according to a study of MaaS in Europe by the American Public Transit Association (APTA). For instance, according to the white paper by Cubic Transportation, governments “might charge the private operator for the privilege of using the road – a public asset – in pay-per-mile schemes.” Along with MaaS, such policies can lead to major changes in the way people choose to move around; individuals would pay for the unintended consequences of driving and this would fund more socially equitable and environmentally friendly alternatives.
Achieving transit equity
MaaS can end the isolation of those left out by our current dependence on individual vehicles. Seniors and young people are two groups without car access who would benefit greatly from MaaS, particularly as part of a complete, integrated transit system. Up to “26 percent of seniors don’t have a car and many avoid driving altogether due to disabilities or other physical limitations,” according to the Cubic white paper. A rural area with an aging population that had access to a complete and integrated transit system would have a much easier time connecting people which could have public health benefits.
The U.S. is behind many countries in making paying for various transit modes through a single smart phone app, according to Ditmore’s webinar on implementing MaaS, which makes it more difficult to move toward full MaaS. However, one area where the rest of the world does look to us is in designing for handicapped accessibility, as mandated by U.S. laws.
MaaS also needs to be designed for those who lack access to a smart phone, Ditmore said in the webinar on implementing MaaS. A single card linked to an account that could be refilled at different locations like a local 7-Eleven would be a useful and effective way to provide this service in the United States. Of course, getting the card to interface with different services, from bikeshare to rail, presents a technical problem, but a solvable one.
Arlington County is positioned to incorporate MaaS
Arlington has made important progress towards laying out the policy infrastructure for MaaS, and has long been at the forefront of transportation demand management (TDM). TDM means understanding travel behavior and decision-making, and providing information and guidance for people to use infrastructure in place for transit, walking, biking, and telework, which naturally encourages alternatives to driving and promotes better balance in the transportation system. “Arlington Transportation Partners has been working on that probably more than any like entity across the U.S.,” said Ditmore. For the past 20 years, “they were really at the cutting edge of how to plan in a different way how to incorporate demand.”
Arlington offers a variety of transportation options: walkable neighborhoods based around transit, a great local bus system, bus rapid transit, rail access, scooters and bike share. Residents also have an array of tools for finding the most convenient trip – by accessing real-time transit information through the WMATA Trip Planner or Google Maps to find the best route, or through the ART RealTime tool to know exactly when a bus will arrive. Residents also have at their disposal the ability to use the SmarTrip card to pay for bus or rail, and the Capital Bikeshare throughout the DMV.
Engineering a better future
MaaS may require a change in thinking for some policy makers and transportation officials and may also require some ingenuity and careful planning to facilitate its implementation. Andy Boenau has suggested that, “it’s challenging for city planners and traffic engineers to truly think about mobility as a service, because we’re so accustomed to intersection analysis and corridor studies.”
It’s reductive to think of MaaS as simply a better app, Ditmore said. Ditmore argued that MaaS has been packaged in a misleading way in the United States, that it is not primarily an app but a policy. Technology and sound policy are both needed to integrate different transportation options and to open up a world of mobility for all in clean, green cities.

 Throughout history, futuristic autonomous vehicles have been featured in iconic movies and television shows as technology designed to assist. However, as this technology has evolved and the future of travel is decidedly pointing to autonomous services, there is still much debate on how the future of mobility and mass transportation will be impacted. 

For generations, autonomous vehicles have been seen as the de facto mode of transportation for the future. Time and time again, futuristic autonomous vehicles have been featured in iconic action movies, cartoons, and television shows as technology designed to assist either the superhero or star of the show. For example, in 1966, Adam West’s portrayal of Batman’s Batmobile included self-driving capabilities, inspiring many to wonder and speculate on what the self-driving future could look like. Those who are familiar with the cartoon “The Jetsons” will remember much of the show’s focus was on autonomous cars, shuttles, and similar technologies. However, as this technology has evolved and the future of travel is decidedly pointing to autonomous services, there is still much debate on how the future of mobility and mass transportation will evolve, and in what timeframe.
We believe that autonomous solutions represent one of the most transformational technologies we will see in a lifetime.
Disruption in the Industry
When it comes to autonomous mobility and its certain future, the term “disruption” often comes to mind. Driverless vehicles and fleets are the disruptors of the transportation industry, as we know it today. But the actual disruption is something that will happen over time. We’re still in the early stages of the evolution of this technology, however. Even the low speed, fixed course autonomous shuttle vehicles are in their infancy as true transportation solutions, with many of today’s deployments being “firsts” for a number of cities and communities. The initial, regulated deployments that are underway right now with these multi-passenger vehicles are advancing the testing and proof points of safe autonomous mobility, and, we believe, they will be a major contributor for driving the disruption that will ultimately result in the full-scale adoption of autonomous mobility solutions for public transportation, and eventually for personal transportation.
Realistic Timeframes
Beginning to deploy low-speed, geo-fenced autonomous vehicles and fleets, as an alternative to traditional mobility use cases, is paving the way for testing what a complete driverless environment could and would look like. Interacting with pedestrians, mixed traffic, and other surroundings are some of the important lessons to be gained from these deployments that will greatly advance the anywhere, anytime, any-speed autonomous services.
There are other important autonomous applications, such as farm equipment, highway trucking applications, package delivery, and industrial equipment, that are also important to the testing and perfecting of autonomy. Although most of the headlines today are about personal transportation, the impact for many businesses will also be substantial. 
For example, a report released by Bloomberg in May 2019 highlights a farmer who estimates he can save 80% on his farm chemical costs by using autonomous equipment. In the transportation of goods, labor represents a large percentage of the cost profile, which will be significantly impacted with autonomous solutions. There is plenty of motivation and positive impact to go around for businesses and consumers, however, a major challenge facing the autonomous technology revolution is managing realistic timeline expectations in the marketplace.
Several media publications suggest that the full widespread adoption of self-driving vehicles, buses, fleets, and public transportation is close, maybe even a couple years out. Although autonomous vehicles are being deployed around the world today in certain use cases such as the low-speed, fixed-route, geo-fenced routes, the full-scale adoption timeframe to ultimately realize true autonomous SAE level 5 deployments is a minimum of a decade away. 
There are also a significant number of opportunities to be addressed beyond just the vehicles themselves, such as cyber security, fleet orchestration and logistics, safety standards, infrastructure, transportation legislation, the customer experience, and more. All these areas are also evolving, making for stronger, more secure mobility solutions and a better autonomous customer transportation experience.
The Human Element and Safety
The first question consumers and legislators ask always revolves around safety. When a vehicle is autonomous, it is a fact that the vehicle does not see and interpret its surroundings today exactly as a human would, and therefore, it lacks a certain level of intuition.
 But, on the other hand, autonomous vehicles react to motion and events at a rate of two to three times faster than a human can, and the use of artificial intelligence will continually improve the needed interpretive logic. Most importantly, autonomous vehicles don’t get distracted by their surroundings or mobile devices. Human error and poor judgement are the leading causes of traffic accidents and deaths.
 There is plenty of research to validate that autonomous vehicles and equipment will dramatically improve safety in all applications. That being said, the immediate, safe-use cases, such as low-speed, fixed-route applications in a controlled environment, will be the guidepost for advancing into more complex, faster-speed applications and wider spread use in our communities and towns.
The Future of Mobility
Ultimately, safety will be the key determinant for the timeline of future deployments and expanded use of autonomous transportation solutions, and this will change the way people think about car ownership and public transportation. Today, we see autonomous fleets using this technology in the transportation of goods, farm equipment, maritime applications, and even package delivery.
 Each of these use cases are examples of where human intervention can be eliminated, and that’s where industry disruption is currently the most prevalent. What’s required to see the mass adoption of autonomous technologies that extend to all roads and highways is the ability to move from low-speed controlled environments safely into high-speed and more complex environments.
Another reality driving the transformation of mobility is the need to serve a new generation of riders. According to recent data released by Deloitte, millennials are less likely to purchase cars than past generations. The data states that 46% of millennials and Gen Z question the benefits of car ownership when rideshare is so easy.
 They also embrace new technology, making them well aligned with the future of autonomous vehicles. Widespread use of new transportation solutions will also help the baby boomer generation who may need additional help with transportation, especially for those who have difficulty driving. Connecting residents or constituents with various services through convenient and cost-effective mobility services will be an absolute requirement for attracting and retaining new residents and businesses to all communities.
The future of mobility is here today in the form of autonomous transportation, but it will continue to evolve over many years before we are able to experience the George Jetson effect. We believe that autonomous solutions represent one of the most transformational technologies we will see in a lifetime. The use cases will expand and extend into many new transportation services in the coming years to great benefit for businesses and consumers alike.

Written by Derek Prall
Imagine this – instead of waking up an hour early to start your arduous commute to work, fighting traffic the whole way, you hail a car as you’re getting ready using your smartphone. It arrives as you’re walking out your door, and shuttles you to your destination.
There is no driver of this vehicle – instead, an array of high-tech tools and sensors keeps the car on its path. In fact, no vehicles on the road are being operated by a human. Traffic is nonexistent, accidents are unheard of and you’re able to relax, have a cup of coffee and start working through your inbox before you even arrive at the office.

It sounds like science fiction, but this future isn’t far off. The Boston Consulting Group estimates that by 2030 almost a quarter of all miles driven in the U.S. will be by shared, selfdriving vehicles.

ABI research indicates that in that same time period, 11 million shared driverless vehicles will be on the road globally – about 5 percent of the world’s traffic. And these changes are already occurring; early this month, Alphabet’s Waymo unit announced self-driving vehicles will be available in the Phoenix area through the ride-hailing service Lyft.
“As a first step, we’ll deploy 10 Waymo vehicles on Lyft over the next few months,” Waymo CEO John Krafcik wrote in a post on Medium. “Once Waymo vehicles are on the platform, Lyft users in the area will have the option to select a Waymo directly from the Lyft app for eligible rides.”
Clearly, this technology is already out there – communities just need to figure out how to best utilize it. Experts agree driverless vehicles will signal a new era in transportation, but unless local leaders begin to plan for this future, putting thoughtful policy in place and creating the proper infrastructure, what should be a science fiction dream could turn into a dystopian nightmare.

The driverless dream
He lays out three scenarios in his book – what he calls the good, the bad and the ugly. The best outcome he foresees is that leaders begin now to shift the public’s desire for privately owned vehicles toward what he calls autonomous micro transit – essentially, autonomous vehicles should be fleet-owned and used as first-mile/ last-mile solutions to support existing public transportation systems.
Sam Schwartz, author of “No One at the Wheel: Driverless Cars and the Road of the Future,” and former chief traffic engineer for New York City’s Department of Transportation, makes the argument that cities should not let these technologies evolve organically. Local leaders need to be proactive and take control of the future of Transportation in their communities, or else.
A worse outcome, Schwartz says, would be fleet-owned autonomous vehicles operating independently of a greater mass public transit system. This would be likely to be the result of overconfidence in autonomous vehicles’ ability to increase roadway capacity. Some experts argue that since autonomous vehicles remove the potential for human error, they would be able to follow each other more closely, essentially mimicking the capacity of a bus or train line.
“There’s no way they could come close,” Schwartz says, “Maybe you’ll increase capacity to the point that each vehicle is one second apart – that’s 3,600 vehicles per hour per lane. This doesn’t mean we’ve increased the person capacity because some of those vehicles will be empty going to pick someone up or leaving someone they just dropped off.”
This would essentially be history repeating itself. “We lost so much good transit when the automobile came on the scene,” he says. “We bought hook line and sinker that we could solve our transportation problems with the automobile and building roadways. A lot of places tried that – look at Los Angeles… once had the best transit system in the country… now the traffic is horrendous.” Schwartz cautions local leaders to think critically about how autonomous vehicles could support mass transit, not replace it.
The worst outcome Schwartz envisions is letting autonomous vehicles hit the streets with minimal thought regarding their impact. These vehicles would be privately owned, and greatly increase congestion in urban areas.
“Let’s say someone comes to visit me in Midtown Manhattan. You tell the car to go park, the car says it’s $50 dollars to park, sorry,” Schwartz laughs. “So, you tell the car to go home – now you have double the miles in that case.
Our nature as human beings is to do what’s best for us as individuals and not necessarily what’s best for society, so we’re going to have so many zombie cars zooming all around doing what’s most convenient for the owner, adding lots of traffic, creating more gridlock than it solves. That’s a future I worry about.”
One thing seems to be certain, though – this future is coming, and it’s going to be disruptive.

Designing the future
Today’s roadways and intersections are designed to move human-operated vehicles during peak congestion hours. These roadways usually have multiple lanes for traffic and dedicated turn lanes adding to their footprint. Pedestrians cross at intersections controlled by timed signals. Parking lots flank most roadways, providing access to retail and residential spaces.
Simply put, a lot of our landscapes – particularly in urban environments – are paved, Sohrweide says. One of the first major ways driverless vehicles will impact our streets is in their design. Generally speaking, Tom Sohrweide, a transportation and traffic engineer consultant for Short Elliott Hendrickson, anticipates these technologies will facilitate the narrowing of roadways, freeing up more space for pedestrians, bikes, scooters and other forms of alternative transportation.
However, when the capabilities of driverless cars are taken into consideration in the design process, roadways can start to change. “With automated vehicles, we would anticipate the headways [the space between two traveling vehicles] would be greatly reduced,” Sohrweide says.  
“By platooning vehicles more, less roadway needs to be used. Instead of things being spread out, they can be consolidated which can, in turn, relate to fewer lanes. Speed differentials will be better controlled – if you get people going the same speed that would also impact roadway capacity.”
The need for parking will also be greatly reduced, Sohrweide says. If fleets of driverless cars operate like a modern transit system with the ability to pick up and drop off passengers continuously, the need for parking lots would be greatly reduced, and these lots could become more remote. This, in turn, would change the way urban landscapes are developed. Without the need for massive parking lots and huge parking decks, city planners could focus on better uses for these plots of land.
Cornell Robertson, Franklin County, Ohio engineer, agrees that considerations need to be taken now to prepare for a driverless future. One of the biggest challenges he sees for his community, however, is preparing all the various types of roadways that the county owns.
“We have a wide range of roadway types – we have urban roadways that are curb and gutter streets, but we also have rural routes that don’t necessarily have curb and gutter but have striping. We also have rural routes that don’t have striping,” Robertson says. “We have school zones, we have railroad crossings – all these various road types are going to be important to study, and we’re going to have to account for all these variations.”   
He’s also concerned about how the patterns of roadway deterioration will change as automation becomes more prevalent. “We have to be careful. When driving becomes automated, there’s a likelihood that the variability of driving will be removed. This will allow for narrower roadways, but if that variability is removed from how vehicles are driven, that will increase the localized wear and tear. This could mean the vehicles – from one car to the next – are traveling over the exact same wheel paths… It’s a nice idea that roadways could be narrowed, but there could be a tradeoff to that concept.”
This shift would necessitate changes in the ways roads are constructed and maintained. Robertson says his county is already exploring innovative ways to make repairs, including chip and seal. As opposed to milling out a roadway and resurfacing it, an emulsion is laid down on the surface and an aggregate is placed into the emulsion.
The roadway is then brushed to remove excess materials and a layer of sealant is applied. This method is much faster and much cheaper, Robertson says. It’s a simple concept, but the individual components of the process have been dramatically improved over the years.
Robertson says the county is also exploring ground rubber tire fibers being added into asphalt mixes. This is an environmentally friendly concept that minimizes the number of old tires going into landfills, and could potentially be a way to create more durable roadways in the future.
This new construction and the redesign of existing roadways will, of course, demand funding; however, as technologies change, our current funding models are becoming outdated. This begs the question – how are we going to pay for this?

Funding the future
Kevin Stone, executive director of the National Association of County Engineers, says the most pervasive model for funding roadways in this country is through gas taxes; however, as fuel efficiencies improve, more hybrid vehicles take to the road and alternative-fuel vehicles become more popular, the revenue generated by this tax is becoming diminished, and communities are barely able to keep up with necessary repairs.
“As technology improves, whether it be fuel standards, autonomous vehicles, intelligent transportation systems or smart vehicle technology, your gas tax money is dwindling,” Stone says. “A lot of the ideas coming out of Congress right now are moving toward vehicle miles traveled, or the VMT model… You’re paying by the mile.”
This essentially sets up roadway infrastructure funding like a utility – the heaviest users pay the most. It’s a more equitable, more up-to-date funding method that Michelle Godfrey, public information officer for Oregon’s Department of Transportation, hopes will become more popular as transportation methods evolve.
Oregon is the first state in the country to launch a fully operational vehicle-miles-traveled tax program. OreGO launched on July 1, 2015, the pilot program is the first to actually use real drivers to collect real data in real time and collecting real money. However, as the program is in its infancy, it’s on a voluntary basis and is limited to 5,000 vehicles, Godfrey says.
“The program isn’t intended to generate any significant revenue like the gas tax does,” Godfrey says. “We like to call it a test run of the system.”
So far, it’s been a resounding success. Godfrey says they’ve been able to demonstrate functionality with every aspect of the system, from customers interacting with third-party account managers to transferring funds into the state treasury.
The program works by having drivers plug a device into their vehicle’s data port, similar to what’s used for pay-as-you-go insurance models. That device connects wireless to transmit mileage and fuel consumption data back to a third-party account manager.
That data is then used to determine how much fuel tax was paid versus how much is owed based on a rate of 1.7 cents per mile. The fuel taxes paid are then credited against the road usage charge. If the customer is owed once this calculation is complete, they are issued a voucher for the difference. Most in the program, however, just about break even.
So why would anyone volunteer to pay an extra tax? Godfrey admits there’s little incentive currently, aside from participating in a program that will likely be the framework for funding roadways in the near future. “These are people that are interested in road use charging,” Godfrey says. “They are thought leaders, technology leaders. They are curious about how it works. It’s not sustainable as a voluntary program, though.”
One issue the pilot program is revealing, however, is that public perception has a lot to do with the success of such a funding method. Currently, it seems people think that if they live in a more rural area and have to drive further distances, they’ll be disadvantaged by such a tax. Godfrey, however, says this isn’t necessarily the case.
“The gas tax is a proxy for a per-mile charge, so they’re already paying more than they would under a road-charge system because they’re consuming more fuel,” Godfrey explains. “They’re already subsidizing current [lower mileage] drivers. That’s why the current gas tax has become so unfair – because so many vehicles on the road are getting such wildly different fuel efficiencies.”
Another issue with perception that needs to be addressed is the “big brother” spookiness of willfully putting a government-issued tracking device into a private vehicle. This will take public education campaigns to overcome, Godfrey says. While OreGO does collect location data, this data is collected only by the third-party account manager, meaning it never reaches the government and is destroyed by law within 30 days. While people were wary at first, Godfrey says that trepidation is waning.
“As people become more comfortable and familiar with using GPS and other similar devices, they have less objection to having this device in their vehicle,” Godfrey says. “When they try the program, they understand how it gives them added value – there are all kinds of other services they can get from their account manager aside from the tax program.” For example, users can track their vehicle if its stolen, they can geofence their vehicle so their teen driver can’t stray too far from home and they can receive critical service updates and component failure warnings.”
While these hurdles might be difficult to clear, Godfrey thinks this model will likely become more popular as vehicle technology advances. “This is a modern technology that addresses the funding problems based on how drivers operate today,” she says. “The gas tax is based on how things worked 100 years ago. The future of transportation demands a modern technological solution. We think this is the most fair.”

Preparing for the future
In an article he wrote regarding the transition to driverless vehicles, Sohrweide offers two pieces of advice for local leaders. First, he encourages them to stay informed and be proactive. Although we’re still about a decade away by most experts’ estimates, it’s important to stay up to date on how these technologies are being developed, where they are being deployed and the lessons that are already being learned.
Several states have established advisory boards on the topic – such as Minnesota’s Governor’s Advisory Council on Connected and Automated Vehicles. He encourages local leaders to seek out such resources.    
Second, Sohrweide says communities need to be intentional but realistic about the roadways they are designing today. Citing data from the National League of Cities, he says only 6 percent of major U.S. cities’ long-range transportation master plans are considering the challenges of automated vehicles.
Ignoring the issue is folly. Today’s roads need to be designed with this future in mind. Focusing on a more equal mix of transportation modes, prioritizing pedestrian and cycle traffic and anticipating the needs of tomorrow’s vehicles will position communities to better handle the challenges ahead.

187,"
 By Nick Tebbutt 
For some time now, the future mobility vision–in which totally autonomous vehicles are an everyday reality and shared mobility services are widely adopted–has been heralded as the future of mass transport. However, as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has inexplicably changed transport behaviour, both at a consumer and commercial level, the consensus is that it will significantly impact the shape of tomorrow’s strategy.  With the lockdown expected to leave a legacy of increased home working, less travelling and unprecedented delivery demand, here, Nick Tebbutt, Head of Global Strategic Sales at HORIBA MIRA, future gazes as to how the evolving post-coronavirus industry landscape may look slightly different. It is widely accepted that mobility in the decades to come will look dramatically different from what it does today. As we all expect, in the long-held vision for future mobility widespread shared ownership will be supported by an intelligent ecosystem of self-driving “taxis”–the remit being to reduce vehicle numbers and congestion, and, in turn, create and integrate in to a much greener urban transport infrastructure. However, this vision, of course, did not account for the unforeseeable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the transformative impact it has had on transport behaviour. With the nationwide lockdown seeing a large majority of the population tasked with working from home, businesses and consumers alike have been quick to realise the ease at which operations can be managed remotely, along with the multiple ensuing efficiencies. According to one recent study,140 per cent of UK businesses saw an increase in productivity during the remote working period, with 85 per cent looking to expand remote working policies as a result of the pandemic. Only recently Twitter, Square, and Facebook announced that they will allow most of their employees to telecommute permanently, while many other major employers, including Nationwide and Barclays, have talked openly about a permanent shift to working from home and reduced office space.2 And there’s the environmental benefits too. Home working cuts commuting requirements, transport congestion and environmental impacts as demonstrated by the huge falls in air pollution during the lockdown – particularly during weekday commuting hours. Thus, with businesses already under pressure to go greener, the compelling case for increased home working as a way to tackle emissions has also come to the forefront. The result could be an irrevocable impact on modern transport requirements. To put it into context, one expert study3 estimates that 87% of those currently working from home would like to continue to do so to some degree, the result of which could see the 10.8 million pre-lockdown number of regular remote workers soar to as much as 17 million. This would mean that 1 in 5 commutes by car could be avoided, equating to 11 billion miles saved per year. But, for the busy automaker whose future designs will inevitably be based on a very different picture, the question begs–how will these changes in consumer behaviour and commercial preferences impact the future mobility requirement?  
Sudden acceleration or a foot on the brakes?
Although the automotive megatrends that were occurring pre COVID-19 are still relevant, the ongoing impact of the pandemic is likely to see some fast-tracked and cause others to slow. Take, for example, electric vehicles (EV). Only this June (2020) saw the Transport Secretary confirm a £12m funding pot to support EV research and development (R&D) projects in a bid to turbocharge the UK’s transition to zero emissions vehicles. Although this amount may be marginal compared to the cost of EV battery development itself, it offers a positive indication of the government’s continued commitment to leading the EV transition, the consensus being that further stimulus may be on the way as part of its recovery plans. Add to the equation increased consumer gravitation with an estimated 12 million UK drivers considering making the EV switch in the next two years4, and the EV category clearly remains a key target area for automakers. Another area of potential growth is that of the commercial vehicle market. With the lockdown forecast to leave an enduring legacy of increased e-commerce, many consumers are now choosing to conduct their grocery shopping online on a permanent basis, and generally minimise their visits to bricks and mortar stores. This will see a huge flow-on effect for distributors and work to accelerate a more advanced, technologically-driven approach to delivery services. A good future indicator of this market shift can be found by looking at Nuro, the ground-breaking Silicon Valley robotics company which tellingly saw its autonomous grocery pod delivery service triple in demand during the recent pandemic4 and recently partnered with Kroger (the largest supermarket chain in USA) as part of its major expansion plans. This marks the start of what promises to be a global shift towards driverless grocery deliveries. And it’s not just about food shopping either. With the business case for driverless commercial EVs offering huge Total Cost of Ownership benefits – thanks to lower refinement needs, reduced non-safety electronic requirements and the opportunity to optimise a system via localised operation in a key catchment distribution area – it looks like this is a huge cost-efficiency opportunity which will be embraced by many industries in the future. In contrast, in the short to medium-term it may be that some key future automotive trends, particularly shared-mobility solutions, see a slightly lower uptake as the industry awaits the full outcome of the crisis. After all, if permanent home working increases drastically, it may be that the level of mobility required may not be as much as originally conceived or it may look slightly different, being used for personal purposes rather than the commute. Ultimately though, the need for a much cleaner transport system isn’t going to go away and the future mobility vision will take prevalence in the long-term–potentially just taking a slightly different shape. 
Navigating the new normal
There is no doubt that it is an incredibly challenging time for the automotive industry as it remains in recovery from the ongoing impact of the pandemic–all while seeking to remain competitive, profitable and future-focused. Thus, amid what is very much an evolving landscape, the onus for automakers will be on ensuring maximum productivity, increasing income efforts and generating the maximum profit margin. As part of this, at HORIBA MIRA we believe that there is an industry need to take a much more agile approach to product development and optimisation, whereby vital engineering and testing is completed at a much earlier stage of the development process to reduce project time and cost risks. For example, when our expert Vehicle Resilience team undertake any type of independent assessment for a client in the field of electrified, connected and automated vehicles we will always seek to be involved in the very initial stages of vehicle development. From thereon in, whether working in the realms of functional safety, automotive cybersecurity or electromagnetic resilience, we will take a staged approach where we go in at key gateways throughout the programme to ensure early identification of any potential related issues. Working in this way with many of the world’s leading automakers, we are able to help negate issues in the development cycle in the initial design stages and maintain a continual process of monitoring and checking at each key stage in order to ensure the highest level of engineering integrity. The result is less prototype vehicle requirements, improved accuracies and optimised efficiencies–helping to reduce project times and overall costs. Thus, as we look forward to the emerging new “normal” we find ourselves in, the onus for automakers, more than ever, will be on ensuring they remain profitable and progressive. With this in mind, early engagement with assessors offers one easy way of reducing the bottom line and maximising profit potential–helping OEMs to remain in good stead amid an emerging post-coronavirus world and future mobility vision which may look slightly different.

Smart cars, drones and car sharing are some of the ways smart cities will reduce traffic congestion. Read about 7 innovative solutions for cities.
By Maria Sotra
With fewer commuters traveling to and from work each day, cities around the world are experiencing a temporary decrease in congestion. As a result, air quality has improved dramatically, showing us the positive environmental impacts that come with reduction in traffic.However, as things begin to normalize and commuters get back in their cars, cities will inevitably see a rebound in traffic congestion. This means that now more than ever, taking the time to implement key solutions for traffic reduction is vital.During peak traffic periods, many freeways and inner-city roads resemble parking lots more than highways, despite alternate transportation options like public transit and carpooling.In California, drivers deal with some of the most congested freeways in all of the U.S., the good news is you often have good weather while stuck in traffic. The bad news? You’re stuck in traffic. According to the Bay Area’s Metropolitan Transportation Commission, traffic on major San Francisco-area freeways has increased by 80% since 2010. California is just one example.Major tech companies are taking their headquarters out of the suburbs and into cities to give their employees an urban lifestyle. However, the sudden growth in these cities has turned the “traffic headache” into the “traffic migraine.”Although it may seem impossible, technology can help. We’re talking about a future of networked systems sharing rich data about our roads and pedestrians, giving way to smart cities. And it’s already happening now.For example, cities can use aggregated data from connected vehicles to automatically identify potholes and other poor road conditions. The data can be integrated with government management so that public works or maintenance workers can automate dispatching and work orders.
Cities turn to IoT to help solve top challenges
Global spending on smart cities initiatives is projected to hit a staggering $189.5 billion in 2023. One of the most important factors in developing a smart city is making sure Internet of Things (IoT) systems are implemented in an integrated fashion. Every piece of technology must work and communicate together in order for city leaders to use IoT data effectively to improve the lives of citizens.The Smart Cities Council says that a: “Smart city uses information and communications technology (ICT) to enhance its livability, workability and sustainability.” Cities can take intelligence from sensors, IoT devices and other connected systems, then analyze it, to help better understand events and forecast emerging trends.The IDC Smart City Spending Guide suggests that global spending on IoT and Smart City technologies will crest $124 billion in 2020. This equals a year over year increase of 18.9% compared to 2019. The study points out that data driven intelligent transportation solutions account for 14% of the total global spend. The three areas identified as some of the most immediate sectors to see IoT investments are energy management, public safety and transportation.
Let’s get geeky
So what is a “smart city” technology? Well, that’s the cool part of IoT. For example, cities can inject smart tech on a mass scale into their electrical grid or municipal vehicles fleets to gain efficiencies and promote green energy initiatives. Or IoT can be deployed to measure air quality, water/wastewater management, fill levels in trash cans, necessary illumination in street lighting, Wi-Fi in public areas and so much more. Yes, there are challenges like funding and having the right, skilled workforce that can plan, implement, maintain and analyze a smart city network. But we’ll save that for another post.For now, let’s take a look at some of the neat things happening in cities that are addressing the real reason you’re reading this blog: dealing with all those parking lots also called roads.Some important terms to know:
Automotive IoT refers to in-vehicle technological solutions that collect real-time data to help to reduce costs, increase safety measures, improve vehicle efficiency and much more.IoT module An electronic device embedded in a machine or object that can connect to wireless networks to send and receive data for the purpose of analysis.Data-Driven Decision Making (DDDM) is a form of business and government operations that relies on verifiable, accurate data in order to make recommendations and provide solutions.Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology is when one vehicle is able to communicate to another vehicle nearby. It’s the core of autonomous driving technology, where sensors can detect what’s going on around the vehicle and additional technology can share that data with other vehicles on the road.Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technology is similar, in that the vehicle is able to send and receive information. In V2I, the infrastructure can include physical things such as traffic signals and weather alert systems. The vehicle can send data out while simultaneously the infrastructure can send important data back.
Smart cities can look forward to faster and more reliable internet connectivity on the 5G network. 5G is expected to have average download speeds of 50 Mbps and 10 ms latency as compared to 15 Mbps and a latency of 50 ms. Although this won’t be available to all, since coverage varies depending on location, device technology and provider.

The city of Columbus, Ohio, for example, is using data from its government fleet vehicles as part of other smart city pilot programs to also improve the timing of traffic signals and institute more solutions founded on DDDM. By getting a better idea of traffic flow and how long a vehicle idles at stop lights, the city can better modify traffic signal timing with the changes in traffic throughout the day.
2. V2I smart corridorsSome smart corridors include adaptive traffic signals, in which signal timing changes are automatically made depending on actual traffic demand. Smart corridors can address traffic congested roads as well as hazardous areas, such as one major highway in Wyoming used heavily for freight transportation in addition to regular passenger cars.Using V2I technology, Wyoming implemented a pilot project that would send safety-related weather and accident alerts to drivers volunteering for the program. To do this, 75 short-range communications units are being installed along the highway that can communicate with the other units and the vehicles that have devices installed. Officials expect a significant effect on safety and even the economy since the state will likely spend less energy on accident clean-up and highway closures to deal with tractor-trailer blow-overs.The City of Atlanta has committed to smart transportation investment in V2I with adaptive traffic signal technology, connected video cameras and more, the city is serving as a real-world testing ground for smart transit corridor technology to reduce traffic congestion. Atlanta has recently approved an investment of $173 billion over 30 years towards a transit overhaul plan.Geotab also collaborated with Waycare and the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC) to create a first-of-its-kind product that uses data-driven analytics and actions to support traffic signal operation.3. Autonomous vehicle technologyWhile autonomous vehicles won’t necessarily decrease the number of cars on the road, they are likely to reduce congestion and collisions due to driver error.Platooning is one example of an autonomous vehicle technology. If all roads on the vehicle had autonomous technology, vehicles would be able to speed up and slow down, and merge onto and off of freeways without human intervention, creating a much smoother driving pattern. Platooning is a first-step toward self-driving cars since it requires vehicles on a freeway to communicate with each other about speed and conditions, allowing the vehicles to travel consistently. It would eliminate human error that causes issues like phantom traffic jams, which are caused by the ripple effect of a driver braking in the middle of a freeway.Further bolstering public transit with more first- and last-mile solutions, will also help with traffic congestion by ultimately reducing the number of passenger vehicles on the road. For example, companies like Lyft and Uber are looking at how autonomous vehicles could make their services more viable in conjunction with public transit.4. Real-time traffic feedbackThis affects use of public transit, such as a new project in Kansas City that has a free streetcar carrying up to 6,200 passengers a day in a major business district. The success of the program is largely attributed to all the real-time traffic feedback — not just for where exactly the streetcar is at all times but also the traffic around the downtown area, IoT modules in kiosks allowing them to show available parking spaces, etc. (It also helps with ridership that the streetcar has free Wi-Fi.) This 2.2-mile “smart district” corridor even has street lights that dim when there are no pedestrians walking beneath.Real-time traffic feedback also makes concepts like “congestion pricing” a little easier to sell to consumers who are used to using roads for free. Instead of the typical toll for express lanes, this would change the pricing structure based on peak traffic times and for high-occupancy or exempt vehicles, with the goal of discouraging single-passenger drivers to be on the road at peak travel times.5. Tracking pedestrian trafficAddressing traffic congestion is also about understanding pedestrian traffic. In some cities, pedestrian traffic has been shown to be one of the main causes of traffic congestion in overcrowded areas. For example, the City of Las Vegas is using V2I technology to not only track how many vehicles go through a given intersection at different times, but how many pedestrians are crossing streets — and even jaywalking — so they can reroute vehicle traffic during high pedestrian traffic. The city can also get alerts when a pedestrian is in a roadway when the light is about to change, so they can delay the light if needed, increasing the safety of the streets.In Los Angeles, they’re stepping even further back to examine pedestrian traffic. They’re taking vehicle and pedestrian traffic data and making it open to the public, which means housing authorities and residential developers can better pinpoint commutes, and where housing should be developed to help reduce traffic coming into already congested neighborhoods.
6. Carsharing and multi-modal solutionsReports are not yet consistent on whether or not carsharing and ride hailing apps alleviate congestion. But either way, they provide alternative options. City planners and those in the public transit industry see it as an issue of connectivity — making it easy to grab a car through a private company’s app to head to a public transit station.Though not-yet implemented, the winner of the Department of Transportation’s Smart City Challenge, Columbus, Ohio, plans to invest into a trip planning app that would integrate its multiple modes of transportation and would also establish a single, streamlined payment system. Better connecting the modes of alternative transportation would encourage more urbanites to forego a car altogether. Read Jean Pilon-Bignell’s post on the Canadian Smart Cities Challenge.7. Replacing vehicles with dronesThere are some tasks done by city governments like checking water meters and utility lines that don’t necessarily need to be done by vehicle. With the emergence of IoT-equipped drone technology, utilities and public energy authorities are increasingly using drones to do these regular tasks instead of sending out field workers in a bucket truck. Los Angeles is even looking into drone technology to do things like firefighting.And of course companies are looking at drone technology to do inner-city tasks too, such as Amazon’s drone pilot program for short-distance deliveries. In fact, President Donald Trump signed an executive memorandum to make it easier for these types of companies to test drones in cities.

 Non-automotive companies enter the fray to develop tech for connected, autonomous, shared, and electric mobility along with global auto majors
Frost & Sullivan’s recent analysis, Strategic Insight into the Future of the Global Mobility Technology Market, reports that advancements in mobility technology will open new growth opportunities for companies aiming to tap into mobility services and solutions of the future, such as mobility-as-a-service, shared and autonomous fleets, and mobility operating systems. 
This is expected to result in greater collaborations and merger and acquisition (M&A) activities in the sector amongst automotive incumbents, technology giants, network infrastructure providers, and mobility tech start-ups.
“Technology is emerging as the centerpiece in mobility. The focus is shifting from operators and business models toward developing technology capabilities.
 Advanced technologies, such as APIs, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud platforms, mobility service platforms, V2X and V2G technologies, and predictive modeling are starting to shape new mobility,” said Abhishek Iyer, Research Analyst. “The interest shown by ICT companies and start-ups towards connected, autonomous, shared, and electric (CASE) mobility has initiated a multi-industry convergence towards mobility technologies.
 However, a singular approach towards these aspects is restrictive in terms of capturing the huge potential that exists. The collective involvement of participants with varied capabilities is essential towards solving the future mobility equation.”
Iyer added: “As technology evolves, services are becoming more complex and nuanced. New opportunities can be found in areas such as fleet orchestration, mobility planning and designing, and seamless transition from human-driven to autonomous fleets. Also, 5G networks will play a crucial role in the advancement of future shared, automated, and connected vehicles. Omnipresent wireless networks that have extensive coverage, high data transfer speeds, and low latency will drive the advancements in highly connected shared mobility technologies.”
For further revenue opportunities, market participants should explore these strategic recommendations:
Providers of future mobility solutions and services must leverage and continue to build on their core technological strengths to capture underlying growth opportunities effectively.While the fastest route to gaining access to these technologies is through mergers and acquisitions, companies should develop a strategic roadmap to lay out a clear picture of how their existing core expertise would integrate with the acquisition of new technology capabilities to drive innovation further.Extensive collaboration among long-standing participants from the automotive and technology sector along with the value provided by new mobility technology suppliers is required to enable disruption in the evolving landscape. This collaboration becomes even more essential for existing companies to survive and thrive over the next decade, which is expected to change the face of mobility as we see it.Success in the mobility technology ecosystem will depend on the development of new business models and revenue strategies, which can harness the potential of cross-industry expertise and incorporate them into mobility technology solutions and services. While the necessary focus on CASE is absolute, a well-defined and timely approach toward it will stand to make the difference.

 There’s more holding back fully-autonomous vehicles than automotive technology. 
By Bryce Johnstone  
Last year, Elon Musk said 2020 would be the year we finally saw a fully-autonomous Tesla on the road. But bullish predictions like Musk’s don’t reflect reality – one where most companies and experts are rolling back their autonomous vehicle expectations.
Ultimately, fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) could be decades away because it’s not just about designing and manufacturing a vehicle. It’s about a whole ecosystem. As disappointing as it may be for some, it’s more realistic to be looking to 2035 for deployment of Level 5 autonomous vehicles.
The busy exec looking forward to maximizing their journey to work will have to keep waiting. But the wait will be worth it. We should appreciate that rushing to deliver autonomous vehicles just for the sake of it is in no one’s interest. Simply put, there is too much to risk.
While the race for the first fully autonomous vehicle continues, let’s take a closer look at three reasons why AV development is taking longer than predicted.
1.) Cities Need to Become Smarter
It can take several months or years to repair roads and bridges, and even longer to build new ones from scratch. On top of all the work involved in maintaining them, our roads must become as smart as the new autonomous vehicles that will pass over them every single day.
Faster cellular tech, such as 5G and the technology that follows it, are just one important component. The actual environment, including most roadways, must rely on Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) technology, which is still in development. This will require persistent connectivity between the vehicle and the road or city using Wi-Fi, dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), or other technology. All of this is still being developed, so even if AVs were ready to go today, automakers would still have to wait for the infrastructure to catch up. This is by no means a quick and easy task: Smart infrastructure will require the installation of millions of sensors across streetlights and traffic signals, as well as stop signs, construction notices, road exits, and much more.
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) connectivity is another essential feature, as it will one day enable vehicles to inform each other of upcoming traffic light changes, road hazards, accidents and traffic jams. Like most automotive technologies, V2V is still in its infancy.
The long-term benefits could be very significant, however, as smarter roadways allow for vehicles to travel more closely together and at equal speeds. This increase in efficiency could eliminate the need to expand roads with additional lanes, saving millions (if not billions) of dollars over many years.
2.) AVs Need to be Safer
Safety has always been the most important aspect of mobility, but it takes on a whole other dimension when cars drive themselves. By removing the need for a human driver, AVs will need to incorporate a plethora of sensors, such as LiDAR and radar. They will also have to utilize a vision system that can effectively see the road without human involvement. It’s a tall order, but it’s one that automotive OEMs are taking very seriously as they progress toward AV deployment.
Unlike other tech products, which might be rushed to market to meet deadlines, self-driving cars are on their own schedule due to the number of safety standards they must meet. It will take more than the millions of driven miles and billions of simulated miles to perfect the technology.
AVs must not only understand what should happen, but they must also be able to overcome all the challenges that could develop on any given road. Mudslides, rainstorms, snow, sleet, and hail are just the beginning. Any hazard or anomaly imaginable – falling boulders, objects that fall off trucks or overpasses, or forest fires that spread across roadways – must be considered. No car will be able to predict every possible incident, but AVs will need to understand and adapt to potential issues before they become a problem.
3.) Drivers Need to Accept AVs
It is widely understood that driver attitudes will shape the future of mobility as much as the technology itself. If consumers are unwilling to relinquish control, AV deployment could be slowed until drivers are persuaded.
According to the mounting body of evidence, when it comes to accepting automated transport a global divide remains between East and West. While the mass markets of Asia seem to have bought into self-driving vehicles, the more safety-conscious consumers of Europe and North America remain skeptical.
However, it is believed that consumer sentiment is slowly changing. SAE International, a global association for automotive engineers, found promising results after surveying approximately 1,400 consumers. The majority (82%) were “enthusiastic” about AVs before being given a test drive; roughly 10% reported higher enthusiasm after taking a driverless car for a spin.
Better still, 76% believed that the driverless car experience was on par or even better than a human-driven automobile. An additional 37% are convinced that driverless cars will reduce accident-related deaths when they debut. That’s an encouraging sign for an industry that is heavily focused on eliminating human error and, in the process, personal control of the vehicle.
Focusing on What Matters Most
These are just a few of the reasons why automakers are taking their time with AVs. It’s not about when they’ll be ready as much as it is how the many complex challenges associated with autonomous driving will be solved.
As OEMs rack up additional miles on real roads, test tracks, and in simulation, they will better understand what it will take to bring autonomy to the masses. And when AVs finally debut, consumers will be able to rest easy knowing that the cars were developed, engineered, and defined to meet their brief – a vehicle that can sense its environment and move safely with no human input.
Autonomous cars are too complex, and their occupants are too important, to rush the technology and deploy before it is truly ready. This is why the automotive industry is taking a cautious approach that will allow manufacturers, both big and small, to carefully develop the ultimate AVs. The end result will consist of cars that are safer, more capable and more convenient, paving the way for a genuine evolution in the future of mobility.

With a pandemic gripping our world right now, busy roads seem like a thing of the past. That is, however, hardly true. As soon as life starts getting back on track, traffic congestion will be back in full force, and city governments will struggle immeasurably with traffic management. Urban areas, both big and small, will return to day-long traffic jams and significantly longer commute times.
 Such problems affect the ordinary citizen the most, and every city looking to turn smart must first tackle them. Here are some truly “smart” ways to fight to overcrowd and reduce traffic congestion with smart city tech in urban areas. These apply to cities of all sizes and have already been employed successfully by many city governments.
Traffic Light Optimization
Smart programming and digitization can be used to control traffic light operations in both large and small urban areas. When traffic lights co-ordinate ideally and respond to demand in real-time, road capacity can be maximized quickly. Smart traffic lights can also be synced to the movement of larger vehicles or conditioned to respond appropriately to situations like gridlock or blockage. All of this programming can be done with expert knowledge of the non-linear relationship between traffic flow and delay.
Parking Zone Extension
The exacerbation of traffic congestion in urban areas is mostly a result of limited parking spaces. Even in larger cities, controlled parking zones are limited to certain main streets. There is usually an unbalanced mix of residents’ parking, pay and display, and limited wait parking zones. The best way to tackle congestion is to extend parking controls away from the city center and formulate smart parking zones, even in less crowded areas. 
To enhance their functioning further, these parking zones can have virtual permits, 1-hour time limits, and regular patrolling by civil law enforcement officers. Making them smart would mean collecting real-time data on commuter parking and directing the crowd to emptier zones accordingly.
Autonomous Vehicle Usage
While using autonomous or self-driven vehicles will not reduce congestion quantitatively, it will help manage traffic in a more advanced fashion. Without human intervention, smart cars can practice effective collision management, discover new roads to reach a destination, platoon perfectly, and gather data about free and empty parking zones to decide the best parking spot. Moreover, smart vehicles will also eliminate traffic jams caused solely due to human error. All of these combined reduce both commute time and congestion well.
Pedestrian Traffic Monitoring
Smart city management authorities should not blatantly assume that the sole cause of traffic congestion is vehicle traffic. Pedestrian traffic, when ignored, is equally worrying. Having realized this, cities like Las Vegas and Los Angeles are using V2I technology to monitor pedestrian traffic and reroute vehicle traffic accordingly. The data thus collected is also useful in traffic light optimization to increase road safety. For instance, Los Angeles is making the data gathered public to real estate developers and locality planners to help them build residential complexes in locations that experience less congestion.
Drone Usage by City Management
This is one of the best ideas to reduce traffic congestion with smart city tech. With the development of IoT based drones, most tasks that once needed inspectors, repair and delivery professionals, or city officials to travel in vehicles can now be done via drone cameras. Smart cities that employ drones to carry out minor repair tasks and most inspection tasks can quickly reduce the number of trucks and buses on the road, especially during peak hours. Even private companies like Amazon are now experimenting with drone-based deliveries in highly congested cities, and there’s no reason governments can’t do the same.
Levying Workplace Parking Charges
Most workplaces offer their employees the option of free parking. This incentive encourages people to commute to the office every day in separate cars since they don’t have to pay anything to park at the office even for long hours. A workplace parking fee is known to have a significant effect on both congestion and pollution. Levying a charge on workplace parking can be useful in promoting carpooling amongst employees, which will, in turn, reduce congestion on roads. It will also improve public transport usage and allow both private and public firms to re-evaluate their parking space usage.
Building V2I Smart Corridors
Using V2I technology to make roads smarter is one of the best ways to reduce congestion in cities. Using connected video cameras and satellite imaging, drivers can be informed about accidents and weather-related alerts as they drive on particular roads and expressways. These roads would act as smart transit corridors, where all the vehicle drivers would have information about the conditions about to welcome them in the next few miles. They can then decide to reroute from a congested road or slow down to avoid further crowding.
These innovative methods require minimal spending and are long-term solutions suitable for even the most heavily congested cities. Governments need to plan well, use IoT, AI, and digitization, and respond timely to a crisis, to make urban roads smooth for commuters at all hours of the day.

We’ve mentioned the rise in bike sales quite a bit over the past six to eight months. Since people were cooped up inside from late spring until now, they looked to ways to get out and about safely. Individuals who purchased bicycles during quarantine may have been considering leisurely purposes, but you now have a huge opportunity to redirect their newfound hobby into commuting.
For any of your employees who contributed to the recent rise in bike sales this year, biking to work will be a change for them. This means you will need to make the process easier. While we’ve written about encouraging bike commutes post-COVID, this blog is focused on how you can help out employees who have already decided to bike
Bike repair station
In our most recent Commute+ Reimagined webinar, our panelist Ricardo Vera, SR HR Specialist at NCR Corporation, touched on why they installed a bike repair station. 
“We were missing something that most bike commuters would take for granted, but it’s pretty critical for somebody that doesn’t know much about [bike commuting],” he said. “We had to install a bike fix-it station.”
This stood out to us as an important point about new bike commuters for a few reasons. The first is just how many things there are to consider when biking to work, especially for novices.. They have to worry about the rules of the road, which route to take, when to leave, and what happens if something goes wrong with their bicycle – just for starters.
While a bike repair station can only ease one of those concerns, it’s a pretty big one. If employees bike to the office, they want to make sure they will be able to bike home. It’s really the same as if they drive or take the bus: No one wants to be stranded at the office.
The second point is the responsibility assumed by Ricardo and NCR, as the employer, to help employees successfully make the switch to commuting by bike. It’s easy for employers to encourage their employees with their words to change their commutes to a more sustainable option. It’s another to back up their talk with actions that can make a difference.
Showers, lockers, and secure bike storage
Now that we’ve discussed bike repair stations, we want to talk about other installations that can contribute to long-term success for new bike commuters. The first? Showers. We’ve all – most of us, at least – been in the situation of sweating when you get to the office on a hot day. It’s uncomfortable, it’s annoying, and it’s not particularly pleasant for anyone.
Having showers available at the office can change that. In fact, employees are five times more likely to bike to work if they have the ability to shower when they arrive. That statistic alone should make you put a plan in place to install showers as soon as possible! The timing is perfect, since there are fewer employees in the office than pre-COVID and you don’t have to worry about construction disrupting daily operations.
When someone does have the opportunity to shower after their ride to the office, they are going to want a secure place to store their belongings. Providing a locker room or personal storage spaces is the perfect complement to an in-office shower or hygiene station.
Ricardo also mentioned on our webinar how, in addition to the bike repair station, his company had more than 90 secure bike parking spaces available. It just goes to show how all bicycle accommodations work together to create a full commuting experience. When trying to create lasting new habits, ensuring a positive end-of-trip experience is crucial to long-term success.
Guaranteed ride home
As we mentioned, no one wants to be stranded at the office. If you bike to the office, you want to bike home, or at least get home. Partnering with a local transportation management association (TMA) can help make that a guarantee, even if a bike breaks down on the way to the office and can’t be repaired.
Transportation management associations are organizations that work with employers in their area to help make commuting better. This can include working to pass infrastructure changes, offering shuttle services, or providing guaranteed rides home. For the sake of this blog, we’re going to focus on the guaranteed ride home.
A Better City TMA, located in the greater Boston area, has a great guaranteed ride home program. (They are far from the only TMA providing this service, just one example!)
To take advantage of their guaranteed ride home program, individuals must work for a member organization or be a tenant of a member community. Qualified members can receive as many as six free rides per year, up to $100 in value. Even better? This benefit can be used for your employee, or someone they care for. You can visit their website here for more information about how their program works. If you’re looking for a similar program in your area, you can simply Google “guaranteed ride home + your city/area.”
You don’t necessarily have to take every single one of these suggestions to create a successful bike program at your company. However, making the effort to show your new bike-oriented commuters that you’re thinking of them can be the difference between a one-time trial and a long-term behavior change.

 This innovation will protect lives on the road and will work in tandem with visions for increasingly optimized delivery systems with fewer anticipated road casualties. 
By Olivia Vahsen
The first documented idea of an autonomous car was introduced in the New York World’s Fair in 1939 in the Futurama exhibit as part of General Motors’ vision of the future of America in 20 years. Nearly 70 years later, we are well on our way to an autonomous future with the goal of making driving safer and more efficient for all. In fact, scientists predict that self-driving cars will greatly reduce — if not completely eliminate — car accidents in the near future.
The main focus of autonomous driving has been about enabling driverless passenger cars, but as technology has advanced, the conversation has shifted from solving for the driver to talking about how autonomy can positively change the roads for freight trucks and fleet drivers as well.
There is a perfect storm that exists within advancements of autonomous trucking which makes the future of it both viable and attractive: easier routing, made even easier with advanced mapping systems of recent years (advancing more each quarter), and elimination of human error. 
Weathering road conditions
It’s no secret that truck drivers face long shifts on less than populated highways, often long into the evening or early morning; deliveries don’t sleep in locations far in the North, not even during the coldest, shortest days of the year. Large vehicles with these extensive loads, traveling long distances, have a large history of emergencies, unexpected issues, and mental and physical wear on the drivers who use them.
Trucks are heavier than passenger cars, contain loads of variable physical sizes and potentially unusual dimensions, making them hard to maneuver with today’s “standard” popular crash-avoidance and lane assistance software, and cannot be treated the same way during emergency stops. Sensors cannot be placed at the exact same locations to help with this process and must be adapted to the unique measurements of these vehicles.
And yet, all of these factors have not halted development, whether a truck needs to accommodate regular load transport at all times of day, at high speeds, or in moderate weather, with some of the most dangerous conditions soon underway. 
This suggests a safer, brighter future for the transportation industry, computers create reactions impossible for humans in the direst of circumstances. Developments like these prove to revolutionize one of the most heavily relied on, but simultaneously risk-heavy, industries.
The long road to autonomous adoption
Progress in recent months within autonomous trucking again tells us that companies have succeeded in creating trucks that can self-pilot across more substantial distances, with testing primarily in the Southwest. As these vehicles travel primarily on established, large freeways, routing becomes simple without adjusting for complex parking, traffic, and small city street dimensions.
The types of freeways present in these areas also raise a lot of questions in terms of adaptability, as trucking roads are not designed equal throughout the world.
While technology advances forward, there will inevitably be delays from the production of driverless trucks to their legal use on roads. What form this takes can splinter in countless directions for countless reasons; the purpose of the truck, in which specific state or region it is being used, perhaps even the views of the local population and their desire to share the road with autonomous systems of this size.
Ultimately, it may not be several years before widespread adoption, but the progress is still coming faster than many might expect. For some, this progress also comes at great personal concern —namely, the fate of truck drivers, who currently comprise 3.2 million workers in Europe alone.
Not phased out
Truck drivers have been at the root of concern of being at risk for redundancy, as self-driving capabilities in cars have increased to most commonly include driving on highways for more substantial stretches of time within their offerings. Several companies, such as Waymo and  Starsky Robotics, have logged countless driverless truck hours in the past years in familiar trucking territory.
Despite these advancements and concerns, there are many factors requiring human supervision which leaves many aspects of this job potentially secure.Trucks cannot, at this point, deliver their own maintenance, or respond to construction workers or police giving verbal commands. There is a level of human interaction that cannot be replicated by systems that do not have the communications functionalities separate from their self-driving technology.
Trucking into the next decade
While less popular in the public eye, autonomous long-range hauling is likely to evolve over the next several years as countries and companies decide how to integrate the new systems which look to disrupt a core industry in world transportation. 
This disruption can be seen as the best of both worlds — the optimization of safety and the promise of reduced job displacement. This innovation will protect lives on the road and will work in tandem with visions for increasingly optimized delivery systems with fewer anticipated road casualties.

U.S. transit ridership has been on the decline in recent years, with industry experts offering a number of reasons for the trend. Among them: relatively stable gas prices; an improving economy enabling more people to own cars; transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft attracting customers who otherwise might take transit; and public frustration with train and bus services not running on time.
Last year, transit ridership dropped 2.9 percent to 10.1 billion trips compared with ridership in 2016, which was down 3.1 percent compared with 2015, according to the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). Although much of the ridership dip occurred on bus services, rail ridership also took a hit. In 2017, U.S. heavy-rail ridership fell 2 percent to 3.8 billion trips, while commuter- and light-rail figures slipped 0.19 percent and 0.83 percent, respectively, APTA reported. Those decreases occurred even as several U.S. cities opened new light- and commuter-rail lines, built extensions and launched streetcar routes.
The impact of TNCs on transit ridership was cited as a key factor in a recent New York City Economic Development Corp. (NYCEDC) report on the decline of bus and subway ridership in New York City. While ridership was down, car driving — fueled in part by app-based services — is increasing, according to the New York Post’s report on the NYCEDC’s assessment.
“Growth in subway ridership began to fall as app-based companies took to the streets. This trend is especially apparent after lower-cost ride sharing services, including Via and UberPOOL, launched in the city,” the NCEDC stated. “Uber, Lyft, Via, Juno and Gett provided roughly 93 million trips in 2016, up from 41 million in 2015.”
Competition or collaboration?
The popularity of TNCs — as well as the potential for autonomous vehicles to transport people more efficiently — has led some transportation industry observers to predict that mass transit ridership will only continue to fall.
Of course, APTA officials and transit industry executives don’t see it that way. If anything, the Ubers and Lyfts of the world have helped push agencies into a bigger-picture conversation about how they’ll serve as the go-to manager of passengers’ day-to-day transportation options and needs.
For the past several years, U.S. transit agencies have been grappling with the “first-mile, last-mile” challenge — that is, helping riders travel that short distance to or from a train station or bus stop. To help close that transportation gap, agencies have adopted a number of strategies, such as partnering with Uber and Lyft to subsidize transit riders who use those services to get to and from stations. 
Agencies also made it easier for riders to bring bicycles and skateboards on board trains and buses; launched their own bike-share programs; installed easier-to-follow signage directing pedestrians to transit stations; and created neighborhood shuttle or van services to pick up riders at their doorsteps.
Next step: Manage mobility
Moreover, many agencies are embracing the concept of “mobility management” — designing or providing transportation that begins and ends with the rider, according to APTA. Agency execs say mobility management is the next step in solving the first-and-last-mile dilemma.
“Transit agencies across the country are focused on their next step in the overall progression of being isolated agencies and more toward this mobility management role,” says Ben Limmer, assistant general manager at Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA). “They’re really trying to get customers to the most effective mobility option in real time in order to make their trip to and from wherever that might be.”
A recent report by mobile ticketing and software company Masabi illustrates why transit agencies should work in partnership with TNCs and other entities to address passengers’ daily transportation needs. In a survey of more than 1,000 U.S. residents with access to public transit services, the firm found that:
• 70 percent of respondents drive themselves on at least a weekly basis;• 40 percent never use public transit despite having access to it;• Convenience is the top motivator for passengers who choose to ride transit;• 35 percent of respondents combine ride-sharing with public transit at least occasionally;• 7 percent of respondents combine ride-sharing with public transit at least weekly;• Up to 25 percent of potential riders said convenience features — such as combining transit modes through an app, mobile ticketing and location tracking — would cause or have caused them to use public transit service more often; and• 95 percent of weekly rideshare customers use public transit, which researchers suggest points to a future of reduced car ownership in favor of public/private urban mobility options.
“By implementing the types of convenience features found in ridesharing and other transportation alternatives and integrating multiple transit modes to deliver full first-last mile mobility, the emerging mobility ecosystem is set to provide a viable alternative to car ownership,” said Masabi CEO Brian Zanghi in a press release. “Getting there, however, will require public/private partnerships between the agencies and mobility services that Americans already depend on every day.”
For its part, MARTA has been “very busy” figuring out how to provide safe and efficient first-and-last mile connections, according to Limmer.
MARTA has been improving way-finding initiatives for pedestrians and motor vehicle drivers; installing ADA-compliant pedestrian infrastructure; and creating a bicycle infrastructure to connect to the transit system, he says. For example, MARTA cooperates with the city’s initiative to make Atlanta a friendly place for bike riders. In 2017, the agency completed a partnership with the city to install Relay Bike Share kiosks at 16 MARTA rail stations. Plans call for MARTA to expand Relay to rail stations outside the city, says Limmer. “We’ve done a partnership with bikeshare organizations and car-share companies. And we work with a lot of what I call hyper-local transit organizations; these are focused on private buses or shuttles that take patrons to and from MARTA bus and rail systems,” he says.
One click, one pay, one journey
In the future, MARTA plans to launch a new “MARTA On the Go” app that will provide riders a one-stop source for information and choices for their mobility options. The agency is beta-testing the technology, which would enable riders to use the app to plan, book and pay for their entire journey starting from their homes, Limmer says.
Combining technology with the plethora of mobility options is how transit agencies will evolve in the future, Limmer believes.
“That’s really where we see transit agencies going — toward being mobility managers,” he says. “More specifically, they’ll be migrating toward a one call, one click, one play, one pay transportation network overall. You’ll be able to use the same app to make a variety of trips.”
Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) has been applying a comprehensive approach to its first-and-last-mile predicament. In 2014, Metro adopted a first-last mile strategy and guidelines calling for infrastructure improvements that create “easy, safe and efficient access” to Metro stations and stops. In 2015, the agency’s first-and-last-mile guidelines won a national planning excellence award for a best practice from the American Planning Association.
“At its core, the strategic plan is a planning method, so it allows us to look at any location, station or bus stop, figure out the difficulties that our passengers are encountering and proceed toward improving those conditions,” says Jacob Lieb, senior director of Metro’s first-and-last-mile planning.
Many transit users live close enough to get to the Metro system by foot or bike, skateboard, scooter, skates or wheelchair. However, they may face challenges getting there, such as long blocks, freeways to cross, broken sidewalks and safety concerns. As a result, many of Metro’s first-and-last-mile efforts have involved planned improvements to streetscapes, sidewalks, crosswalks and signals, as well as adding wayfinding signage, bike lanes and lighting near and around stations. Planning is underway to improve existing stations, while station-access issues are being addressed in all new transit development plans.
Other elements in the first-and-last-mile “toolbox” include Metro’s own bike share program that it operates in Los Angeles, Venice and Pasadena — with more locations to come. And later this year, the agency will launch a microtransit pilot project that will offer shuttle bus or an “Uber-type” curb-to-curb service, says Metro spokesman Rick Jager.
The results of an annual ridership survey will help the agency determine what else to put in the toolbox, says Lieb. Metro also is researching why people living in a metropolitan area known for motor vehicle gridlock are not using the local transit system. (Rail ridership has grown as the agency has opened new lines; it’s primarily the bus service that has declined, Metro officials say.) For example: Are they not riding because getting to a station is difficult and, if yes, how so?
Ultimately, tackling Metro’s first-and-last-mile challenges will require tighter relationships between the agency and the neighborhoods where transit stations are located.
Metro planners learned that lesson earlier this year when they used the agency’s new strategic plan to conduct a comprehensive study of first-and-last-mile issues on the Blue Line, the system’s oldest rail route. The 22-mile light-rail line runs between Los Angeles and and Long Beach.
“The Blue Line travels through heavily low income and transit-dependent communities, and has the most challenging existing conditions in terms of safety and access around the stations, particularly because it’s sharing space in the corridor with goods and freight movements,” says Lieb.
Cast a wide net for solutions
Metro’s planning team cast a wide net to come up with solutions for improving access to each station, as well as proposing improvements in neighborhoods via transit-oriented development. The entire Blue Line effort could result in up to $1 billion in potential investment, according to Lieb.
The team partnered with community-based organizations (CBOs) to help ascertain first-and-last-mile challenges and needed infrastructure improvements along the line. The report, which came out in March, features recommendations specific to each station and its community.
Efforts to draw up the plan included walk “audits” of neighborhoods, as well as discussion groups that addressed neighborhood issues such as redlining, gentrification, policing and security.

“By [its] very nature, first-last mile infrastructure can be the most neighborhood oriented element of a transportation system that a person uses,” the final report states. “As a consequence, identifying first-last mile challenges and improvements becomes part of a much larger canvas of how a community defines its character. And that means the community needs to be engaged in early first-last mile planning, and the actual implementation of a plan’s recommendations.”
Lieb says working directly with CBOs and neighborhood groups to dig deeper into issues that define their communities gave Metro planners a “different perspective” from what the agency has done in the past to address station-specific problems.
“Our real point of emphasis is to expand our sphere of interest into the public right-of-way around our stations,” he says. “And what we’ve seen to this point is pretty great enthusiasm from the jurisdictions in wanting to maximize the value of transit stations in their cities, and in working with transit agencies to improve their streets.”

Artificial intelligence (AI) lab Fetch.ai and blockchain firm Datarella have launched a pilot project in Munich, Germany, called M-Zone, which will focus on using AI-powered software agents to better optimize smart parking.
Smart parking has become an increasingly important part of enabling smart infrastructure for the greater whole of smart cities. Smart parking helps to fit more vehicles into appropriate spaces without the intervention of human drivers. Optimizing parking spaces will allow for better organization of traffic flow and help to prevent traffic jams.
The Fetch.ai and Datarella trial will use public transportation through a tokenized incentive system while reducing congestion that contributes to CO2 emissions.
“Parking is one part of a bigger mobility picture, but in our view a cornerstone one,” Humayun Sheikh, CEO of Fetch.ai told Electronics360. “Up to one-fourth of cars on the road in cities are looking for a parking space, so it has a huge impact on transportation infrastructure.”
Sheikh said that multi-agent systems running on a decentralized network help to coordinate complex tasks between multiple vehicles that have not been previously possible. The goal is to take people who are driving everyday and nudge them toward less intensive usage of the car park.
“We hope to be able to significantly reduce the amount of CO2 being released and ultimately provide the city of Munich with a sustainable option for an otherwise congested city center,” Sheikh said.
How it works
The AI-powered blockchain technology allows businesses to deploy autonomous economic agents (AEA), intelligent programs that are built with pre-defined goals and skills — from simple conditional logic to advanced deep and reinforcement learning models. The system is integrated into building infrastructure where cameras with machine vision log the vehicles as they enter a parking structure as well as the vehicles’ position. A smartphone app is then used to receive incentives.
M-Zone will solve the needs of the smart city by:
Saving time and money and reducing commuter and driver stress.Simplifying approval for new development projects for property owners.Lowering rent by sharing dynamic parking spots.Optimizing traffic flows in cities.Lessening the negative effects of CO2.
The reward system will help to incentivize drivers to reduce the number of car trips to the Connex Buildings and corporate offices as measured by the utilization of parking spaces.
 Each registered user that uses the car park will be awarded with a certain number of tokens per minute for not parking in the parking lot. As soon as a car or its wallet address is registered as parked by the Carpark app, the token airdrops to the wallet. The number of tokens rewarded per wallet and minute depends on the current utilization of the parking lot.
“Individuals are incentivized to use public transport by being rewarded with digital coins in their wallets,” Sheikh said. “We will be using FET tokens to incentivize the behaviors associated with the M-Zone trial, but longer-term any token could be used for the incentive.”
More pilots to come
The pilot smart parking project will launch in Munich’s Connex Buildings and aims to scale up in 2021 both in Munich and in other locations. The next steps are to run a larger project for the IAA Mobility 2021 trade show, taking place in September of next year, which will run city-wide.
Sheikh said the M-Zone trial is part of the first program Fetch.ai plans to conduct in the coming months in several industry verticals including the hospitality and mobility sectors.
The Fetch.ai and Datarella smart parking initiative is one of several pilot projects that have been announced worldwide to test automated driving capabilities inside parking structures.
Human Horizons is working on a valet service in Shanghai, China, using lidar, radar and communication devices in parking areas to identify and track vehicles and obstacles inside a parking structure. A different valet system project is taking place in the automotive core of Detroit. In this project, Ford, Bosch and parking vendor Bedrock said the automated valet could save the same amount of space to yield about 20% more vehicles inside a parking structure. 
Cornell University has created smart parking software to match drivers with parking garage spots in order to help reduce congestion and emissions while saving drivers the time spent finding spots.

A futuristic smart city, complete with intelligent cameras, autonomous vehicles and sensors galore, is closer than ever before – and cities that use smart technology stand to save money, improve public health and become hyper-efficient in their use of space.
Comcast Business recently convened a virtual panel of North Florida experts to discuss what it will take to create fully “smart” cities and what Florida cities have already done to make their communities smarter. Here are three key takeaways from the virtual event.
Connected ecosystems are a mix of different technology innovations
It will take a combination of technologies – including automated vehicle ecosystems, camera-monitored crosswalks and traffic lights, and sensors embedded in the ground – to truly create a smart space. These technologies generate and process a large amount of data that needs to move freely within a smart city ecosystem, so a strong data storage system and network for its transportation are equally as critical as the smart technology itself.
Still, smart cities are not created overnight. For already-established cities like Jacksonville, implementing technologies that can build on each other is a good way to get ongoing value from these systems. For example, smart metering programs have evolved so that municipal workers can read meters from a neighborhood’s entrance instead of walking around individual properties, which lowers liability risk and saves time and money.
The North Florida Smart Region Coalition’s entry for the Smart Cities Council’s Readiness Challenge included projects like autonomous vehicles and self-driving shuttles, dynamic stop lights that adjust to traffic conditions, as well as street lights that brighten as people pass by and dim again to conserve energy. With a consortium of more than 100 public agencies, nonprofits and businesses working to bring smart technologies to Jacksonville and St. Augustine, Florida, these concepts mark the beginning of a much broader effort.
Meanwhile, community spaces that are being built from the ground up present optimal opportunities for developers to incorporate smart city elements in original design plans, saving time and the hassle of retroactively trying to fit smart solutions into spaces with less flexible designs.
People are an equally critical element to the creation of smart cities
It will not just take new technologies and data storage to truly bring smart city ideology to fruition. As local businesses are reenergized and community spaces change design, key stakeholders in the community will play a critical role. Cities that partner with local technology companies to develop and implement smart solutions are often at an advantage, because these companies are nimbler and have more immediate access to innovative solutions than a city would on its own.
For example, a local startup recently developed an AI machine learning program for smart phones that can track important road data like potholes in real-time, which in turn helped conserve public budget for road maintenance.
Smart cities create a digital connective tissue in communities, but it is important to develop infrastructure platforms that reinforce human connections. Implemented correctly, these solutions can not only improve profit margins for cities, but also solve very real problems in communities, including rush hour traffic backups, pedestrian fatalities and timely health care delivery.
Cities looking to implement smart technology should first convene public forums to hear from community members on how certain technologies will be received, and if there are any barriers for implementation. And, with the recent rise in online meeting spaces, these forums are now easier than ever to schedule and attract community members to.
Remember digital deserts when developing smart cities
Even though smart city innovations are already being explored and implemented, an area cannot call itself fully “connected” until its digital deserts have been included as well. Digital deserts are typically underserved communities with poor to no access to network connectivity, something that is even more critical to the average household following shelter-in-place orders brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.
It has become clear that broadband is an essential service, just as much as water and electricity are. Planning a new community with smart technologies built in from the ground up is certainly a best practice for design, but these types of projects are more likely to happen in communities that can afford that infrastructure. Meanwhile, low-income community members often don’t have the option to connect to the internet and work from home, making it harder for these working professionals to learn new skills or apply for jobs and for their children to fully participate in remote learning opportunities and virtual classes.
In the face of the ongoing pandemic and ever-changing development cycles, scaling and urban planning will be key to creating smart cities without digital deserts. Developers and community leaders should take this opportunity to invest in technologies that make their entire communities safer and smarter.

 One of the most persistent issues transit and transportation planners face is how to move their populations a mile or two. A few miles are often all that separates a rider’s front door from a transit stop; or the distance from a transit stop to an office. 
One of the most persistent issues transit and transportation planners face is how to move their populations a mile or two. A few miles are often all that separates a rider’s front door from a transit stop; or the distance from a transit stop to an office. It’s the dreaded “first-mile/last-mile” conundrum. And it often means the difference between taking the train or bus into work, or driving the car, often unaccompanied, and contributing to increasingly congested highways and growing greenhouse gas emissions. 
According to the American Public Transportation Association, every dollar invested in public transportation brings four times that in economic impact. So while it’s true that transit agencies tend to require investments that aren’t repaid in fares, an effective transit system does contribute to the economic vitality of a community.
Transit agencies large and small have launched many efforts to attract riders by making those first- and last-mile trips easier. It has often meant partnering with a private-sector transportation provider like Via or a transportation network company like Lyft or, increasingly, a bike- or scooter-share operator.
Just over a year ago, transit agencies in Los Angeles and Seattle launched partnerships with Via, a provider of on-demand, shared transit. Riders engage with the service much like they would a ride-hailing app, while folks without access to a smartphone can dial a call center for service. The pilot programs were funded by the Federal Transit Administration.
In Los Angeles, the pilot covered service to three distinct zones, with each ride starting or ending at transit stations within the service zones. One of the larger overarching missions for officials at L.A. Metro, the region’s transit agency, was reducing single-occupancy trips.

“If we’re doing that — and this certainly can contribute to that — we’re getting more people who used to travel alone to use alternative means,” said Joshua Schank, chief innovation officer for L.A. Metro. “And our initial data indicates that we are.
“A lot of people who were driving alone and parking at stations are saying they’re using this,” Schank added. “A lot of people who used to have a more cumbersome and long, challenging ride to stations are using this. Those are the types of metrics that we are looking at.
“Now, the question is, at some point, is it worth the amount of money we’re spending to get those outcomes? And, from our perspective, this has been a real win on that front,” Schank continued. “Because we’ve been coming in under budget. We have a partner that’s been very flexible, that has tried to accommodate what we’re trying to accomplish and really wants to work with us to meet those goals.”
Ridership has grown from week to week, with only 100 to 200 rides per week in the initial few weeks. As word of the service spread, however, ridership picked up to 3,500 rides a week prior to the slowdown brought on by the novel coronavirus, which took ridership down to 1,300 rides a week. Riders don’t pay when boarding, but instead pay their fare when transferring onto a connecting bus or train.
“It’s taken a while for word-of-mouth to get around, for people to know about the service. It definitely took time to grow that ridership. But it has been going up and up,” said Marie Sullivan, project manager for the mobility-on-demand pilot project. The program has expanded to now serve 10 Metro stations.
In Seattle, transit officials organized a similar year-long pilot with Via, connecting riders to five light rail stations. The pilot concluded near the end of March.
“The idea was to test the use of a transportation network company to provide first- and last-mile service, to make it easier for people to access our transit system, and to expand the access of those transportation network companies to populations who historically have been left out of being able to use on-demand services,” explained Casey Gifford, Innovative Mobility project manager for King County Metro.
The city of Seattle expressed interest in the project and contributed funding to expand its scope. Four of the five transit stops served by the on-demand service were located in Seattle, offering seven-day service at those four stations, 5 a.m. to 1 a.m., correlating with the service hours of the light rail system.
Ridership mostly followed the peak service seen during morning and afternoon commutes on the light rail system, and totaled about 1,000 rides per weekday.
“We also have a lot of youth who take advantage of the service. They’re using it to get to school, and get to jobs, and get to recreational opportunities.”

School-age riders also turned out to be frequent users of an on-demand shared transit program launched in Cupertino, Calif., in November 2019 as part of an 18-month pilot program, again using Via as the service provider.
“Generally, the community has been really supportive and happy with the program. The data we’re getting is really interesting. I think we went into this assuming it would be more something seniors would take advantage of, and maybe not the rest of the community as much. We’re seeing a really broad usage pattern,” said Chris Corrao, senior transportation planner in Cupertino, adding that a number of users of the program are turning out to be high-school-age riders who may use the service to get home from school or to afterschool events.
“Usually for these kinds of programs, you get the huge morning and afternoon peaks, and then sometimes quiet during the day,” said Corrao. “And we’re not seeing that at all. It’s just kind of busy all day, which is great. It’s expensive to run, so we want to make sure it’s as used as possible.”
The goal of the projects is to “leverage the transit infrastructure that these transit agencies have already built, and help bring more people to transit,” said Obinna Emenike, general manager of partners at Via, speaking during a panel discussion at the CoMotion LA conference last fall in downtown Los Angeles.
“Both of the services have been a success,” Emenike said of the projects in Los Angeles and Seattle. “I think we’ve hit every single one of the KPIs [key performance indicators] that we laid out, and the service continues to grow.”
Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority (CapMetro) in Austin, Texas, also partnered with Via to launch a new on-demand service now available in six zones, an expansion from one area back when the service was piloted two years ago. The expansion was due, in part, to the elimination of some of the fixed-route bus service following a system redesign, said Tony Lynch, supervisor of the Demand Response Planning department at CapMetro.
“Our Board of Directors requested that where we removed fixed-route, we have an alternative service,” said Lynch. “We determined Pickup was the best option for these locations. Each zone must have access to grocery stores and frequent fixed-route transit at a minimum.”
Ridership has grown since August last year, when it hovered around 80 to 100 riders a day, to 400 to 500 a day — or sometimes slightly more — by February. It has slipped significantly since service was adjusted for the coronavirus response.
The service is designed to both connect riders with regular, fixed-route transit and offer transit within the service zone.
“We determined that the zones must have trip generators like grocery, retail, post office, parks and connections to frequent bus service,” said Lynch. “Initially it looks like the majority of trips are taken to grocery stores and connecting to other transit. Of course, some customers use the service to visit friends and family who live within a particular Pickup zone.”

Not all public-private transit partnerships are formed with traditional transit. The service created in Cupertino is an example seen in a growing collection of small communities — the Silicon Valley city, home to Apple headquarters, has about 60,000 residents — where on-demand transit is the only option.
Cupertino will contribute about $1.2 million for its shuttle service.
“Which is no small amount,” said Corrao, “but it is significantly less than running a full community shuttle.”
In some cases, such as a proposal in Wilson, N.C. (pop. 50,000), communities are contemplating abandoning existing fixed-route transit service.
The city council in Wilson is considering a proposal to replace fixed-route transit service with an on-demand system operated by Via.
“It is very difficult to operate an efficient transit system without the economies of scale found in metropolitan areas, which is one reason most cities of our size do not provide public transportation,” said Grant Goings, city manager for Wilson, in a statement. “For years we have been looking for a technology-based solution that would increase our levels of service to the citizens while containing costs. We believe this public-private partnership provides such an opportunity.”
Other partnerships have formed between transit agencies and transportation network companies (TNCs) like Lyft or Uber. The Transportation Authority for Marin County, Calif., launched a program three years ago to provide up to a $5 per ride credit for users of the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART), a newly launched commuter rail service for the area north of San Francisco. The program was expanded this year to include two new SMART stations in an effort to grow ridership on the train as well as reduce congestion and air pollution.
Another pilot program that involved a partnership with both Lyft and Via to get riders to light rail stops in the Denver metro area in 2016 was ultimately discontinued due to the high cost of providing service that complied with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Officials say measuring success for these programs — and continuing their operation — is based on a number of factors. And the coronavirus crisis represents the newest curve ball thrown at transit.
“We’re still working with our partners to determine what’s going to happen,” said Gifford at King County Metro, in an interview in early April. The future is less sure given “the new wave of uncertainty that’s come upon us pretty rapidly,” she added.
In Cupertino, ridership data from March and April showed that most users were no longer using the service to get to school or connecting to Caltrain stations like they had been.
“Now, all of our trips are, like, to Target and Whole Foods,” said Corrao.
“We almost considered pausing the program,” due to low ridership, he added. “But we decided, if people are using it, even if it’s a lot less, then we want to have the option for them.”
The city and Via have suspended shared rides in order to maintain physical distancing requirements.
In Los Angeles, Schank said Metro plans to explore other on-demand transit opportunities.
“Our partner remains the people who need it most,” he said plainly. “So that is always what we’re going to be looking for. Where are the places where first- and last-mile options are not great? And we’ve got economically disadvantaged communities we can serve.”
What the new era brought on by the coronavirus has demonstrated is the benefits of a system quick to respond to by-the-moment changes, said Sullivan.
“One thing that service has been able to show, in the midst of this crisis, is flexibility that is inherent in the service model,” she remarked.
In Seattle, ridership numbers are but one metric, said Gifford.
“We’re also looking at who is riding. And equity is one of our core components, or core goals, at King County Metro.”
One of the goals of the program was to serve disadvantaged communities as well as to ensure the service was accessible for riders of all abilities.
“We are also looking at sustainability and the safety of the service,” said Gifford, adding, “ultimately, we’re going to have to take into account the financial situation.”
And of course, all transit agencies are exploring any number of partnerships.
“We’re all about innovating and testing new ways to facilitate access to mobility for our customers,” said Gifford. “And we’re really excited to have more tools in our toolbox for us to leverage. We know that a 40-foot bus is not always going to meet the needs of all of our users, so we are all about testing a range of different mobility options for different populations, for different contexts, to see what works best for each community.”

It’s no secret that Los Angeles is notorious for its traffic jams, typically ranking first in studies of the nation’s traffic hot spots. Estimates suggest that Angelinos spend an extra 120 hours a year stuck in them. While a nightmare for drivers, the L.A. transportation system does have its advantages if you’re devising a new system to quickly predict and potentially redirect that traffic.
Researchers from across the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory set out to do just that under the umbrella of a larger project on the design and planning of mobility systems led by collaborators at DOE’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).
Using an artificial intelligence (AI) technique called machine learning, the team leveraged Argonne’s supercomputers to digest traffic patterns from nearly a year’s worth of data taken from 11,160 sensors along the large California highway system. That information was then used to train a model to forecast traffic at lightning fast speeds—certainly faster than L.A. traffic. Within milliseconds, the model can look at the past hour of data and predict the next hour of traffic with great accuracy.
Working with members of Argonne’s Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) division and the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), a DOE Office of Science User Facility, the team achieved exceptional results in traffic forecasting, recently publishing those results in Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board.
“The AI and supercomputing capabilities that have been used in this work allow us to tackle really large problems,” said Prasanna Balaprakash, a computer scientist in MCS with a joint appointment in the ALCF. “The scale of this project is large, and this amount of data requires an equally large computing resource to tackle it.”
Using ALCF’s world-class computing resources, the scientists drastically reduced the number of computer hours needed to train the model. For example, where it might take a top-of-the-line desktop computer a week to train the traffic forecasting model, the same process can be done in three hours on a supercomputer.
Harnessing the power of graph-based deep learning—a complex form of machine learning that can make decisions and improve a model’s predictions almost automatically—their model uses historical data to predict traffic patterns, while forecasting speed and flow at the same time. This is important because traffic flows in one area at any given time depend upon the speed and flow of traffic nearby.
“Traffic forecasting approaches are critical to developing adaptive strategies for transportation,” said Eric Rask, a former principal research engineer with Argonne’s Center for Transportation Research and one of the scientists involved in the study. “Traffic patterns have complex spatial and temporal dependencies that make accurate forecasting on large highway networks a challenging task.”
Not only did the team capture those dynamics, they accomplished it on a network with dramatically more sensors and prediction locations than previous traffic forecasting models, Rask noted. And by breaking the large network into a number of smaller ones, they were able to train each portion of the network independently, greatly increasing the speed and effectiveness of the model.
Previous models could handle data from only 200-300 sensor locations; but with this new graph-partitioning method, the team was able to process data from over 11,000 locations while reducing the model training time by an order of magnitude. This method was not only fast, it could accurately predict the speed of traffic an hour into the future, typically within 6 mph of the observed speed at any location across the network.
“The scale and accuracy of the forecasting techniques have the potential to enable better decision making,” said Tanwi Mallick, a postdoctoral appointee in MCS and first author on the project.
Mallick and her colleagues believe the model can be readily integrated into traffic management centers, providing traffic controllers a better means by which to react to and address traffic jams and reroute traffic accordingly.

  The Uber-like program will have store associates delivering packages on their way home from work. Will it work for Walmart? 
By Laura Heller 
Walmart store associates may be coming soon to shoppers’ doorsteps. 
Walmart announced earlier this month that it was testing a new delivery method — one that has store associates making deliveries on their way home from work. Marc Lore, president and CEO of Walmart U.S. e-commerce, pointed out on the company’s blog that 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart store. Product is already being delivered to stores and associates can sign up each day to take packages to their final destination and earn a little extra money.
“Walmart has strength in numbers with 4,700 stores across the U.S. and more than a million associates,” Lore said. “Now imagine all the routes our associates drive to and from work and the houses they pass along the way.”
While the program is currently being tested at three stores — two in New Jersey and one in Arkansas — the system is an example of how multichannel merchants can further leverage their installed store base to compete with Amazon, its network of distribution centers, and a growing fleet of delivery options.
“This effort provides Walmart with even more control over the last mile, which we believe is critical in retail, and remains an advantage for brick-and-mortar retailers as speed to the customer gains increasing importance,” Moody’s Lead Retail Analyst Charlie O’Shea told Retail Dive in an email.
But while Lore’s technology-based approach and Walmart’s many stores may be up to the challenge, it’s an extremely complex endeavor that doesn’t quite fit with Walmart’s longtime efficiencies in consumer goods distribution, which entails the customer taking care of that last mile. The program is either an ingenious attempt to address last-mile delivery problems — or terribly misguided, depending on who you talk to.
As rival retailers ponder how to compete with Amazon’s robust delivery infrastructure and make the most of their store footprints, the discussion forum RetailWire asked its BrainTrust panel of retail experts the following questions:
Do you see Walmart’s use of employees to make deliveries on their way home from work as a potential last mile game changer for the retailer?What do you see as the benefits and potential pitfalls of this program?
Here are eight of the most provocative and insightful comments from the discussion. Comments have been edited by Retail Dive for length and clarity.
1. Outside the box
Mark Ryski, Founder and CEO, HeadCount Corp.: I’m not sure if it will ultimately be a game-changer, but full points to Walmart for thinking about the delivery challenge in a completely new way. One of the big benefits is in providing employees an opportunity to earn additional income — essentially “Uberizing” employees’ commute home. Making the program voluntary is an important element of the program since not all employees will want to do this. And if this gets customers their deliveries sooner, that’s great too. Of course there are plenty of ways this could go wrong, but I’m sure Walmart will stress test the idea thoroughly before it gets too far. Overall, I think this is a great example of how innovation doesn’t always need to be just about technology.
2. Cheap and desperate
Ken Lonyai, Digital Innovation Strategist, Co-Founder, ScreenPlay InterActive: Walmart is not known for the happiest employees. Even with pay, I don’t think too many will openly embrace this idea. If they do, there are umpteen things that can go wrong with this idea that make it sound, to me, like a cheap and desperate move by management. Back to the drawing board guys.
3. Liabilities
Mel Kleiman, President, Humetrics: I am not a lawyer but all I see is a major liability problem for Walmart if one of those employees has an accident on the way to delivering an order. How are the workers going to be compensated for time and mileage?
4. Getting it right
Steve Montgomery, President, b2b Solutions, LLC: The concept sounds simple but as with many things the devil is in the details. An employee who is driving home from work is off the clock and no longer being paid by Walmart. However, if they are delivering packages for the company they would be eligible for compensation. If the time delivering the packages bumps them up to the number of hours to be considered full-time they would be eligible for the benefits that come with that status. If the delivery time took them over 40 hours, overtime would have to be paid. As an employee on the clock is Walmart still legally responsible for their actions?
Some other details would be: does the driver get paid mileage, who is responsible if they have an accident and what happens if the packages get damaged, stolen or lost in transit?
5. Innovative
Charles Dimov, Director of Marketing, OrderDynamics: Game changer — no. Innovative? Definitely. Kudos to Walmart for looking at ways to improve and strengthen their service offering while improving their margins. Presuming they will pay their employees a benefit for doing this last mile delivery, it is another great way to tap into their own resources to drive the holistic benefits of omnichannel retail.
In fact, at a time when so many retailers have been closing their physical presence, this type of out-of-the box thinking needs to happen more with retailers. This empowers employees to make a difference that can count in supporting the company and their important roles. Well done Walmart — keep surprising us!
6. Flashback
Art Suriano, CEO, The TSi Co.: Think back to the days of when in the ’50s and ’60s. We had the bread man, the milk man, the egg man and much more all making home deliveries. There was more than just a purchase of an item and payment; there was a relationship formed with the customer and the delivery person. I see the same benefit here with many of the store associates delivering items to customers. If they are well trained and engage with the customers they meet, this could be very beneficial for all parties involved. 
7. Returns too?
Ron Margulis, Manager Director, RAM Communications: One wonders if the employees will be picking up returns on their way to work.
8. What took so long?
Christopher P. Ramey, President, Affluent Insights & The Home Trust International: Independent and/or small businesses owners (and employees) have always delivered products “on the way home.” Why not? Employees will like it because they get out of the store earlier. They’ll also, if they carefully manage it, keep count on mileage for tax purposes. Management will enjoy leveraging a key differentiator: feet on the street to serve clients.
The only “ah-ha” to the strategy is why it took so long.

 By Paul Budde 
THERE IS A LOT OF HYPE around 5G but none of it is new. We saw the same propaganda – fuelled by the manufacturers – in the run-up to the launch of the 3G and 4G versions of the mobile technology.
Driverless cars and a range of other internet of things (IoT) applications can indeed potentially open new revenue streams. The reality, however, is that these markets might not eventuate until somewhere between 2025 and 2030. The reason for this is that many of these developments have little to do with technology. They depend far more on radical changes in society and the economy. This means that it is more likely we will see any large-scale implementation of such services over decades rather than years.
Obviously, there will be some low-hanging fruit when the 5G network is rolled out and starts covering larger parts of the country, but also this development will take many years.
Take, for example, autonomous cars and consider this — for that technology to work, a very large part of the road infrastructure will need to be covered by 5G. This would require a 5G antenna every 200 metres along those roads. In Europe, the telecoms operators have argued that if this is to happen car manufacturers will have to assist in such an investment. To date, there has been little or no interest from them in co-funding such infrastructure.
Apart from those logistics, the 5G technology would have to be extended with mm-wave technology and that would require new spectrum that has not yet been allocated. There are also questions regarding health safety that still haven’t been answered.
So, what is in it for the operators in the meantime? Basically, greater network efficiencies and extra capacity, at incremental costs. No new revenues but lower costs. It will also provide more backhaul capacity. This makes the operators less dependent on the fixed copper networks for their backhaul requirements.
In the heavily concentrated telecoms market in the USA, we also might see that carriers such as Verizon and AT&T will force users of the fixed copper network onto their 5G mobile networks, most likely at higher costs to the users and at lower costs to the operators. By doing so, they will hope to avoid rolling out fibre networks deeper into the market. Without any serious competition and regulatory oversight, they might well be able to get away with this. With competition declining in general, it will be tempting for operators in other countries to replicate such strategies.
It is, however, interesting to contemplate 5G as an infrastructure technology being applied by fibre network operators (FTT-5G). Rather than bringing fibre all the way to the home, can it be used to provide customers access for the last few hundred metres to this through 5G? If this is a reality (bringing fibre to every 5G cell/tower), then we could see massive cost savings on the consumer access end of the network.
In countries with poor network quality, we could see the lower end of the broadband market moving to mobile-only solutions. Of course, this only works in areas where 5G will be made available. However, bear in mind that a full rollout could take five-to-ten years. Unfortunately, those in already poor fixed broadband parts of regional and rural areas are not going to get 5G anytime soon. The reality being that initial networks will be predominantly rolled out in metro and urban areas.
Another observation here is that there is a ban in place on Huawei 5G equipment in the USA and Australia. These two countries will be at a disadvantage, as this Chinese company is the global leader in 5G, both in relation to innovation and price/performance. This will give all those 5G operators in countries that don’t have the Huawei ban a great advantage over those in America and Australia. The political ban could hamper innovations specifically in the area of IoT.
This could be seriously detrimental to technical innovation in the USA, as this country no longer has its own national telecoms infrastructure manufacturing industry. It might be less relevant to Australia as this country is not a technology leader, just a follower. The lack of innovation in Australia was recently lamented by David Thodey, Chair of CSIRO and Jobs for NSW and former CEO of Telstra and IBM ANZ.
5G equipment itself is only part of the overall costs of the 5G rollout. The fact that the other manufacturers are roughly one-third more expensive than Huawei will also affect the actual price that consumers will have to pay.
Don’t expect 5G miracles to happen any time soon. Initially, it will be a network efficiency play mainly about network efficiency and very few users will notice much change. As far as exciting new services are concerned nothing significant is going to happen in the next few years. Nevertheless, over the longer term, 5G will be an exciting new technology that will most certainly lead to a large range of new innovations and new developments in the telecoms market.
