 Integrating on-demand microtransit options into existing services allows agencies to better serve communities with affordable, convenient public transit, promoting economic mobility. 
By Kellie Meilleur



Nearly 70 percent of all Americans who depend on the bus for their transportation needs make less than $50,000 per year. This, according to a report by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), validates that lower-income individuals rely more heavily on public transportation than those who are earn higher incomes. 
Across the nation, more and more transit agencies and cities are turning to on-demand microtransit service to expand and improve public transportation options for low-income residents. 
What exactly is microtransit? Simply, microtransit is dynamic routing. It takes mobile smartphone apps and puts them to use to create an efficient mode of transport that adapts with each passenger’s trip needs. At the click of a button, passengers can book a trip that will take them on the quickest route to their desired destination.  
A distinctive aspect of microtransit, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, is that it is “a privately owned and operated shared transportation system that can offer fixed routes and schedules, as well as flexible routes and on-demand scheduling. The vehicles generally include vans and buses.” 
Microtransit can be easily accessible and highly efficient anda ‘no-brainer’ for many lower income individuals who can’t afford to own a car and have therefore been greatly underserved by traditional transit networks.
When COVID-19 first hit, a majority of higher income earners began working from home and using their personal vehicles for necessary travel. On the far end of the spectrum, millions of lower-income Americans didn’t have the same luxury or opportunity. They needed to get to and from their jobs and other destinations, despite sweeping changes in how transportation options had changed and disadvantaged many since the pandemic.  
That’s where microtransit in its many forms came into play, and in a big way. 
Many transit agencies, anxious to serve their most underserved customers and plug the gap between traditional fixed-route transportation and more individual transportation options, are offering riders fast and convenient ways to book their trips.  
Microtransit has proven to be a mobility lifeline. Amid the many shutdowns we have all experienced, on-demand transit has pivoted to serve specific community needs, such as food delivery to our most vulnerable community members and transporting hospital and other frontline workers to their jobs, even in the overnight hours. In fact, APTA’s data shows that dynamic, on-demand public transit has proven to be a mobility lifeline for those in low-income areas during this crisis.
Transit industry expert, thought leader and influencer Paul Comfort recently hosted a podcast segment on his show, Comfort’s Corner, about the role of microtransit for equity and inclusion. As a thought leader in the public transportation space, Comfort sees public transportation’s role as one to improve equity and inclusion for those who need it most.First, it was for the elderly and those with mobility challenges, and now, it’s for those who are underserved.
Comfort believes that microtransit is the hottest trend to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. When the pandemic hit, transportation providers made major changes to their service based on changing ridership demand and to adhere to health and safety requirements. This included altering transit routes and changing the frequency of trips. These changes immediately impacted those who had no other means of getting from point A to point B. The silver lining is that microtransit has been the solution to the transit shortage problem. Comfort explains that “microtransit fills the transit gaps, and it ensures that no one gets left behind.”  
The great news is that the stop-gap solution that microtransit provides is here to stay. Significant data across several U.S. cities has recently been gathered suggesting that microtransit has been a vital public resource for lower-income individuals since the start of the pandemic. This information, along with insights shared by transit thought leaders like Comfort, help the transportation industry to look ahead to the long-term need for microtransit as part of the equity and inclusion solution. 
By joining the microtransit movement and integrating on-demand options into existing public transit infrastructure, transit providers across the country can better serve their communities with affordable, convenient public transportation and promote economic mobility for all.

Bringing
 items to the end consumer is as old as civilization, but many delivery 
firms and retail partners are in search of a profitable model
By Brian Straight

Many
 assume that last-mile delivery arose alongside the rapid growth of 
e-commerce. That narrative is simply false. Household moving companies 
have long considered themselves the final mile of delivery. Before them,
 there was the milkman, common in the early 1900s, who brought fresh 
dairy products to consumer doorsteps.
Lyft, Uber, et al seemed to 
change the game, though, but even their independent contractor-based 
businesses are not unique. During the Roman Empire, items reached eager 
citizens through cursus publicus
 (Latin for “the public way”). The system was a state-run courier and 
transportation system that utilized everyday citizens called mancipes, 
aka contractors, to transport food, animals and equipment.
The 
last mile is not new, but it is behaving very much like a startup 
company, seeing rapid growth in the last few years and now, perhaps, 
transitioning into its next phase — sustainability.
Last mile looks for balance
“The market will find a more natural equilibrium,” Guy Bloch, CEO of delivery technology firm Bringg,
 told Modern Shipper. “Today, what is done with market funding, now it 
will find a more equilibrium [of investment]. To really do it well and 
always find the most efficient driver to satisfy your customer at a 
margin that works for you, you need to digitize.”
The last mile is
 going through change and doing so rapidly. Like a startup company that 
invested heavily in scaling before trying to find its true profitability
 model, the last mile is now looking to find its equilibrium — that 
perfect mix of providers, technology and customer service.
According to ShipBob, 73% of shoppers
 expect affordable, fast deliveries when ordering online. But what is 
affordable to the customer is not always affordable to the shipper. A 
2021 Gartner report found that retailers with 50% or more of their sales
 coming from online channels saw logistics costs 50% above those of 
retailers with primarily in-store sales.
A
 report from Precedence Research said the last-mile delivery 
transportation market was $179.96 billion in 2021 and will grow to 
$423.3 billion by 2030.
Free shipping declines
Clearly,
 there is opportunity ahead. And it’s possible — in fact even likely — 
that what is happening today is just a preview of the changes to come. A
 Gartner analysis of 500 leading retailers found there has been a 12.5% decline
 in the number of retailers offering free shipping and a 30% reduction 
in those offering free shipping on returns between late 2019 and August 
2020. 
“What we used to see was subsidization of last-mile  delivery by gig fleets and now we see that relaxing so the market will  be more competitive,” Bloch said. “Gig is the new way of continuing [to  service the customer] and we see what used to be standard shipping  over the years start to move to local delivery. A year or  two years ago, the gig fleets subsidized a lot of the adoption. … What  we are going to see is it will be less subsidized than before.”
Two  recent reports on the state of the last mile have previewed some of the  changes, and real-world feedback from one of the globe’s largest  retailers highlights the struggles brands are facing in meeting this new  demand.
Omnichannel demands grow
“Logistics
 and delivery providers are trying to meet the growing demand for 
competitive omnichannel delivery services demanded by shippers and end 
customers, including same-day delivery, ship-from-store and returns. 
These require greater speed, and agility, and often a restructuring of 
resources, technologies and operational processes,” the report noted.
In
 a survey of 200 logistics and transportation leaders from North America
 and Europe, the report found that 68% of respondents already offered 
same-day delivery or will do so by the end of this year, and 27% believe
 offering returns (which can be as high as 30% of online orders) and 
pickup services provide a strategic advantage.
Still, connectivity
 is a major roadblock, with 44% citing shipper onboarding and 
integration of carriers as an operational pain point, and 44% also 
saying visibility into outsourced delivery partners is an issue. Another
 41% said carrier and driver management were issues.
The Roman 
mancipes simply commandeered wagons and other needs along the way, but 
today’s last-mile delivery network is a bit more sophisticated.
“[The
 industry] is calling and screaming for technology to kick in,” Bloch 
said. “It’s a big change. It’s a major force that none of us control in 
finding the equilibrium.”
Bloch went on to say that he expects 
companies to start acting more strategically in developing their 
last-mile delivery strategies.
“Based on the needs of the market, retailers are perfecting [their strategies] in different ways,” he said.
American Eagle logistics flies high
Global American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) is one of those companies. In 2021, AEO (NYSE: AEO) acquired both AirTerra and Quiet Logistics,
 the former being a logistics technology company and the latter being a 
third-party logistics provider that services omnichannel needs for more 
than 50 brands.
The acquisitions were merged into Quiet Platforms. In its latest earnings release
 on Friday, the outfitter said that its supply chain acquisitions 
contributed about 3 percentage points to the company’s 2% revenue growth
 in Q1.
In an April webinar for project44, Bill Besselman, senior 
vice president of supply chain execution at AEO, said a rethinking of 
the company’s supply chain is helping it manage the last mile.
“When
 we thought about the last mile, we realized the last mile wasn’t a mile
 at all, it was 1,300 miles,” he said. “Thirteen hundred miles was a 
barrier for two reasons — one is speed, and the other is cost. We needed
 to rethink the supply chain.”
Besselman went on to say that AEO 
realized it needed to relocate merchandise closer to the end consumer to
 shorten inbound times to stores and delivery times to customers, but 
that the diversification of the last-mile carrier market was creating 
new challenges.
“There is an opportunity for us as midsized 
retailers and brands to get after these problems differently than what 
we have done in the past,” he said.
Brittle supply chains
“One
 of the things we learned during the pandemic is that supply chains are 
very brittle and they are not very successful [if something breaks],” 
Besselman added, noting that 58% of AEO transactions now take place 
online. “Carrier selection is incredibly important to us. [Different] 
carriers allow us to offer different services.”
That is a point 
that Bloch repeated, pointing to the relaxing of subsidies to fund the 
last mile leading to more competition in the space as logistics 
providers look for sustainable and profitable paths forward.
“We are going through a major transformation and what we all [thought] in theory [is no more],” he said.
“The
 way I look at it, we are about to finish the first wave of COVID, the 
reactive wave,” Bloch added. “The consumer hasn’t gone back to the 
pre-COVID days, they got rewired. Now we are flipping to the second wave
 and the second wave is how do you build a robust infrastructure [to 
sustain e-commerce and last-mile delivery].”
A significant portion of a sustainable last mile involves ways to better manage returns.
“My
 perspective is if you want to play in the online game, which is 
different than the offline game, part of that is returns,” Bloch said. 
“Returns hurt the margins of the business. What I see more retailers do 
is find creative ways to manage returns.”
And more providers are jumping into the returns game. In March, DoorDash (NYSE: DASH) announced it was testing a returns program that allowed its drivers to pick up returns at a customer’s home and deliver it to the nearest FedEx, UPS or post office. Unicorn upstart Veho is also testing a returns program, as are others.
Returns offer a path to profitability
Bloch said services like returns are part of the evolution of the last-mile delivery space.
“Once
 it’s democratized, once it’s digitized, once it’s connected, you can 
start developing flows that serve your business,” he said.
The 
last-mile delivery wheels are spinning, and it is technology powering 
the revolution. The Bringg survey found that for businesses struggling 
with managing last-mile delivery vehicles and providers, only 22% use 
efficiency solutions such as automated order batching or auto dispatch 
and routing. Just 27% of logistics providers offer self-scheduling.
Driver
 wages are also an issue, with 65% saying they are paying drivers more 
in 2022 than they did in 2021, but 38% say driver satisfaction and 
retention remain issues. For an industry that depends on gig drivers 
able to work for any platform on a given day, wages may play an outsized
 role.
“The more the market becomes competitive, the more we will 
need to increase wages,” Bloch said. “As we continue the next couple of 
years and find the equilibrium, we will see more and more fleets 
increase wages. Remember, these drivers are 1099 [workers] so they can 
work for you or another company, and many work for multiple platforms. 
What’s important is to bring competition into the market.”
Ultimately, the progression of the last mile is being driven by one factor that Besselman explained in his presentation.
“We  are excited about the customer experience opportunity because supply  chain has emerged from the back to a customer-centric function,” he  said.

 On-demand transit projects that started before COVID-19 have led to robust ridership and speak to innovation that the public will need in a post-COVID world, according to experts during an event last week. 
By Skip Descant


On-demand transit projects that started before COVID-19 have led to robust ridership and speak to innovation that the public will need in a post-COVID world, according to experts during an event last week.

“From the start of the pandemic, the public transportation industry pivoted to meet a new world of never-before-seen challenges,” said Paul Skoutelas, president and CEO of the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) during a July 28 press briefing. “Innovation became survival.”
APTA organized the briefing to underscore transit innovation during the pandemic and to present a new report titled “Mobility Innovation: The Case for Federal Investment and Support.”
The case studies in the report explore how various transit systems have structured, launched and pivoted on-demand projects. In most cases, the on-demand projects aim to bring transit opportunities to areas where few options exist. These areas are often suburban locations with low-density housing. But in some instances, bigger cities seek to improve their available transportation, as with a project in St. Petersburg, Fla., where the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA) partnered with transportation network companies (TNCs) and taxis to provide late-night transportation for service workers.
In many cases, the arrangements depend on partnerships with private mobility providers. When the pandemic reshuffled all forms of normal American life, transit started serving communities in often unorthodox ways. In Los Angeles, an on-demand program launched as a first-mile, last-mile solution through a partnership with Via. The program’s initial idea was to connect riders with transit stations. During the pandemic, the program, in addition to providing rides, morphed into a food delivery service for residents in need.
“When you have a partnership based on innovation, you can adjust that partnership to fit the needs of the moment,” said Joshua Schank, chief innovation officer for L.A. Metro, at the briefing. “And then it’s not a one-time thing. There are crises all the time. Different things come in and affect what you plan on doing. Being able to adjust is a lot easier when you’re working in an innovation culture and with an innovative team in the first place.”
The program with Via is now fully integrated within the L.A. Metro system as part of the Metro Micro program, an on-demand service Metro provides with its own operators.
“That means we now have a much larger pilot program for on-demand services,” said Schank.
The food delivery service has continued.
“People still need to get to essential food. And this could potentially be a mobility option that saves us trips by reducing the number of times people are going to and from places,” he added.
Before the pandemic, a similar on-demand program kicked off in Flint, Mich., and provided 13,000 rides a month. The program is now expected to provide some 20,000 to 25,000 rides a month, said Ed Benning, general manager and CEO of Mass Transportation Authority (MTA) Flint.
“So the need is very strong,” said Benning.
Another on-demand program in the Kansas City, Kan., area uses a seven-vehicle county-owned fleet. But the project also includes a partnership with a local taxi service, which can flex into the system and pick up some of the demand to cut down on wait times.
“In my mind that’s kind of the secret sauce that makes the microtransit program in Johnson County work,” said Josh Powers, business liaison for Johnson County, Kan.
Microtransit ridership is at 150 percent of pre-COVID levels, said Powers. The service provides more than 8,000 rides a month. Month by month, this number continues to increase.
Skoutelas remarked that transit is frequently seen as an “industry that’s slow to change.” However, this viewpoint overlooks the reality that a lot of change is happening in the transit world.
“[W]e need to bring attention to that,” he said. “And we want to share it as widely as we can.”

An autonomous vehicle, also known as a driverless vehicle refers to a self-driving vehicle with an ability to sense. These vehicles use a fully automated driving system that is capable of responding to external conditions that a human driver can manage. Compared to manually-driven cars, autonomous vehicles have other advantages apart from being environmentally friendly. They reduce the risk of vehicle crashes as its software is designed to make fewer mistakes, reduce road congestion that comes with irresponsible driving, and allow people with disabilities to drive to places. It also reduces driver fatigue and makes overnight journeys easy.
With many tech giants such as Apple, Toyota, Google, and Tesla exploring this new technology, these are the trends that make anticipating the future exciting.
The First Level 5 Autonomous Car: The development of an autonomous car is divided into five stages and with the currency developments, manufacturers are hopeful for a level 5 car.

A Completely Unassisted Drive: Going on a road trip in a totally technology-run vehicle will soon be possible, thanks to automation.
Autonomous Trucking will become a Reality: Autonomous driving technology is set to transform the logistics industry as well with self-driving trucks.
Autonomous Ride-Sharing: The future doesn’t just involve owning a self-driving car, but also using autonomous car fleets for ride-sharing, reducing the dependency on fuel, and being good for the planet.
Diverse autonomous features: It’s not just the navigation that autonomous technology will boost, other automatic features like in-car virtual assistants and AR features will be an add-on.

More than 50 organizations agree to make shared mobility the first, best choice over private car use.
Nearly
 50 public, private and nonprofit organizations announced a major 
initiative to develop and advance the Shared Mobility Action Agenda so 
that by 2030, equitable, low-carbon shared mobility will be more 
convenient, more practical, more available, easier to use and more 
accessible and affordable than driving a car. 
“The gas price 
spike has – again – made many of us painfully aware of our overreliance 
on cars. While electrification is necessary, it’s not enough to solve 
our systemic mobility problems,” said Benjamin de la Peña, CEO of the 
Shared-Use Mobility Center. “The Agenda and Action Network intend to 
make shared mobility the first and best option over car ownership within
 the decade. We need to do this to fight climate change, make mobility 
more equitable, and to help households save money. This isn’t just 
another sign-on document. We’ve developed a to-do list to actually get 
it done.” 
This is a pivotal moment for the future of 
transportation. Low-income households spend almost 40 percent of their 
income on transportation. Shared-Use Mobility Center (SUMC) says the 
latest research shows that the nation is running out of time to take 
bold action on the climate crisis. The number of people killed by 
drivers nationwide while walking increased almost 50 percent over the 
last decade, and more of the victims were older adults and people of 
color, says SUMC. 
“Shared mobility strategies can deliver on the 
promise of safer roads, more equitable transportation, and the 
sustainable movement of people and goods – if done right. That’s why 
we’re here,” said Marla Westervelt, vice president of policy at 
Coalition for Reimagined Mobility. “Coming together with an influential 
network of public, private and community advocates, we can collaborate 
and act to shape the transportation of tomorrow and address the current 
global energy security and climate crises.” 
More than 50 public, 
private and non-profit organizations have already committed to advancing
 the agenda, which supports all shared transportation options, from 
public transportation to ride-hail, from car-sharing to on-demand 
responsive microtransit, from shared bikes and scooters to paratransit. 
In advance of the release of version 1.0 of the agenda later this 
summer, the immediate goal is to continue to grow the number of 
participating organizations and gain even more momentum. 
“As
 the global leader in TransitTech, we believe in a world where everyone 
has access to efficient, affordable mobility. The cost of car ownership 
is higher than many families can afford, but far too often is the only 
way to access jobs, education and healthcare. Technology to make transit
 flexible and shared can help all types of communities -from rural towns
 to big cities increase economic opportunity for their residents while 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” said Hind Ourahou, Mobility Policy 
principal at Via. 
The International Energy Association finds that
 having more shared rides and using more public transportation and 
micromobility can reduce global oil consumption by as much as 800,000 
barrels per day, which is nearly 300 million barrels per year, saving 
money and reducing harmful air pollutants. 
“The devil is always 
in the details,” said Kevin Chambers, founder and principal of Full Path
 Transit Technology. “There are so many ways that shared mobility can be
 done wrong. Getting so many organizations and individuals with 
different perspectives together to collaborate on the best paths forward
 will help ensure we make measurable advances on shared mobility. A 
priority for me has been making sure that the agenda includes the needs 
of rural and community-based mobility services.” 
Another  benefit of moving to shared mobility is communities can stop ceding  valuable property to parking lots and highways and adding to existing  maintenance deficits on miles and miles of land currently dedicated to  moving and accommodating cars. The agenda aims to ensure we maximize the  benefits of making shared mobility more convenient than driving a car.

Across Europe, as cities get to grips with road congestion, air pollution and meeting climate targets, the manual and electric cargo bike is rapidly delivering. Nimble, clean and efficient in urban settings, the cargo bike is quickly becoming the default transport choice for logistics companies, food delivery services and even plumbers.
‘Cargo bikes’ is a catch-all phrase for bicycles that are adapted to carry heavier or bulkier loads, or even passengers and children. For cities, the cargo bike presents a win-win at an important turning point as e-commerce companies and food delivery services continue their dizzying rise. The humble cargo bike presents businesses with a way to increase urban deliveries, improve the speed and reliability of those deliveries, while removing diesel-fuelled delivery vans from urban roads.
A recent study from climate charity and Rapid Transition Alliance member, Possible, found that electric cargo bikes deliver 60% faster than vans in urban centres, totting up higher average speeds and dropping off ten parcels an hour, compared to a van’s six. The same report found that cargo bikes cut emissions by 90% compared with diesel vans and by a third when compared with electric vans.
Cargo bikes have also revolutionised the urban school run, with some holding up to eight children becoming an increasingly  common sight in Denmark, the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, London. The result is less congested roads, more breathable air, fewer road traffic accidents, a radical drop in carbon emissions and a flourishing ecosystem of businesses that can go direct to their customers without harming the environment.
And, the cargo bike market is booming. In Germany, nearly 100,000 e-cargo bikes are sold every year, with its neighbour France ratcheting up around 50,000 sales a year. The UK is a little behind, totting up only 2,000 e-cargo bike sales for commercial use last year. But, this is only set to be temporary, with sales expected to jump by 60% this year and a market size set to increase by 15-fold within the next five years. This rate of growth is set to be mirrored across Europe too, with sales expected to increase by 50% year on year. By 2030, estimates suggest annual European sales of one million cargo bikes for commercial uses and a further one million sales for family cargo bikes.
Wider relevance
The coming age of the cargo bike provides a fascinating insight into rapid transition – and is one that can be replicated in other sectors if we can get all the ingredients right. A combination of private enterprise, government support, design and manufacturing breakthroughs, standardisation and cross-border collaboration have created the conditions where both the demand for cargo bikes, and the supply coming to market, are on an inexorable rise. Alongside these factors has been the enabling power of digital technology, where app-based platforms and digital bike-sharing schemes are increasing the accessibility to cargo bikes for city dwellers, boosting demand and visibility.
While enabled by high-tech manufacturing and improvements in battery technology, the cargo bike craze sweeping across Europe can also be understood as an effective, relatively low-tech climate solution, reorienting transport away from the fossil fuelled-vehicles towards low-impact, low-cost and long-term solutions which have multiple additional benefits. At a time when technologies – both those available and those yet to be invented – often receive disproportionate attention in climate policy debates, the rise of cargo bikes can remind us of how some of the smartest, most easily deployed tools for transition are those that we already have: they are tried and tested.
Scaling up cargo bikes in urban centres can also help lay the foundations for other low-carbon and clean air initiatives, as well as countering the worrying trend of increased car use induced by pandemic fears of using public transport. By providing a solution for industry and businesses to access their customer base and move through urban spaces without the need for cars and vans, cargo bikes can become a enabler for Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs), reducing the allocation of road space for cars which can allow pop-up gardens and Playful Streets to emerge throughout cities, where communities can play without fearing traffic. In a post-pandemic world, where the necessity of e-commerce and food delivery services are perhaps here to stay, finding ways of getting goods from A to B in a sustainable fashion is vital.
There is also a broader economic relevance, where the rising demand for cargo bikes is boosting employment in industrial heartlands. The iconic UK-based bike manufacturer, Raleigh, has only been selling cargo bikes for a few years, but they have already seen their sales increase by 75% last year at their Nottingham manufacturing facility. Raleigh recently partnered with another UK institution – the National Trust – to deploy cargo bikes at their larger sites to help with maintenance and moving supplies around. Raleigh have also partnered with the family dairy company, Jones Bros, providing them with cargo bikes for their London deliveries, replacing the diesel van they used to use for their 10-mile delivery route. With cargo bikes, we are seeing a rich array of collaborations between manufacturers and businesses, who are running pilots to garner an understanding how both their business offerings and bottom lines can be improved by the introduction of cargo bikes.
Context and background
Cargo bikes present an opportunity and solution for both local governments and businesses. Cities around the world are grappling with the issue of poisonous air, where an increase in motor traffic and congestion in urban centres is creating air which is a danger to human health – especially the health of children. Globally, air pollution kills an estimated seven million people a year. In the UK, noxious air is responsible for approximately 40,000 deaths per year. Getting cars off the roads and out of densely populated urban areas is therefore a priority for cities – and reducing the number of larger, diesel-fuelled delivery vans is the best place to start. According to data from the Department for Transport, van traffic in London has grown by 71% over the last two decades, with 47% of the 3.8 million vans registered since 1996 attributed to businesses. In London, it’s estimated that up to 14% of small van journeys in the most congested parts of the city could be made with cargo bikes. In Dublin, postal giant UPS has been trialling a cargo bike hub approach, where two e-trikes have replaced four delivery vans, removing around 500 van-delivered packages from their supply chain and cutting their Dublin-based emissions by 40%.
At the same time, the demand for e-commerce goods, food delivery services and other platform-based, convenience-fuelled ventures are clogging up urban centres with traffic, noise and making the air unbreathable. For e-commerce especially, the roaring demand for same day and next day delivery is causing logistics giants a major headache, causing them to pour in billions of investment into so-called last-mile delivery services. And while venture capitalist and techo-futurists would have you believe that autonomous postal robots are just around the corner, it is the humble cargo bike that’s allowing e-commerce to unlock the last mile puzzle. Some estimates of the financial benefits to businesses range from 70-90% cost savings compared to reliance on delivery vans. Plus, it’s not just the likes of Amazon and UPS getting on their bikes, national postal services are filling up the cargo bike manufacturers’ order books too. Ireland’s national postal service, An Post, recently ordered over 100 e-trikes from the German manufacturer Radkutsche.
The cargo bike craze is a great example of how the co-benefits of rapid transition can quickly align.
Enabling factors
Support from Government and business
The cargo bike craze has been fostered, in part, by a strong policy toolkit across Europe, ranging from local government grants and national subsidies to private business offerings. In the UK, the Department for Transport (DfT) launched their eCargo Bike Grant Fund for businesses and organisations in 2019 and has already awarded over £2 million in grants. In fact, the grant scheme has unlocked such a vast amount of demand for cargo bikes that in 2020, 58 councils across the UK submitted bids totalling £4.2 million – creating a positive problem for the UK to fill these grants to get the wheels in motion.
The business improvement district, Team London Bridge, is currently running a business engagement strategy that has been hugely successful. As part of the programme, Team London Bridge contacts businesses and organisations active with the London Bridge area and helps them bring cargo bikes into their everyday operations in order to capture the numerous benefits. In the Netherlands, a country famed for its cycling culture, the tech-firm Cargoroo has launched an app-based public cargo bike share scheme so everyone can benefit from the cargo bike.
Standardisation for safety
Despite cycling being around for hundreds of years, the cargo bike is something that is relatively modern. And as the sales of cargo bikes boom across Europe, manufacturers and industrial groups are busy creating a European cargo bike standard, which was launched last year. While there are already national standards in France and Germany, the regional growth in the cargo bike market is causing manufacturers to push for greater standardisation across the board. At the front of everyone’s minds is safety – but there are divergent opinions on issues such as bike width, payload and length. Once an agreement is reached, manufacturers will have the certainty they need to push ahead with boosting supply.
The commercial opportunity 
There are plenty of financial gains from deploying cargo bikes throughout a businesses’ supply chain. From reducing the overheads of entering low emissions zones, or the mounting parking fines that many companies face, to having the speed and agility to glide through traffic or even reach areas that motorised vehicles can’t, cargo bikes look like a no-brainer for many firms operating in this space. And it’s not just logistics firms and e-commerce giants who are hopping on the cargo bike craze, many businesses that have to transfer goods as part of their service provision are exploring the potential of cargo bikes: be they plumbers, ice cream vendors or window cleaners.
Cross-city collaboration & advocacy
Alongside cross-border standardisation, comes a deeper form of collaboration. Organisations like the EU-funded CityChangerCaroBike have been expanding to partner cities all over Europe, publishing guidance and advice on scaling up cargo bikes and cycle infrastructure, as well as sharing stories of cargo-biking ‘Local Heroes’. Helping to present cities and national governments in the heart of power is the European Cycle Logistics Federation, which recently launched a strategic partnership with Cycling Industries Europe to create a more unified, stronger advocacy platform for cycling logistics businesses in Europe.
Scope and evidence

In Germany, nearly 100,000 cargo bikes are sold every year, with its neighbour France ratcheting up around 50,000 sales a year. The UK is a little behind, totting up only 2,000 cargo bike sales for commercial use last year.
The UK is forecast to increase by 60% this year and the market size is set to inflate by 15-fold within the next five years.
By 2030, estimates suggest annual European sales of one million cargo bikes for commercial uses and a further one million sales for family cargo bikes.
The UK-based bike manufacturer, Raleigh, has only been selling cargo bikes for a few years but they have already seen their sales increase by 75% last year at their Nottingham manufacturing facility.
Sales across Europe are growing at around 50% year on year.
A recent study from Possible found that electric cargo bikes deliver 60% faster than vans in urban centres, totting up higher average speeds and dropping off ten parcels an hour, compared to a van’s six.
The Possible report found that cargo bikes cut emissions by 90% compared with diesel vans and by a third when compared with electric vans.
The cargo bike boom is, in part, being driven by shifts in consumer habits that have shifted due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, with the number of UK consumers doing a weekly grocery shop online doubling since the first lockdown.
By 2030, estimates suggest annual European sales of one million cargo bikes for commercial uses and a further one million sales for family cargo bikes.

Lessons for rapid transition

It is easy to overlook old, unglamorous technologies that can play a big, new role in rapid transition: a perfect storm of road congestion, traffic threats, air pollution and changes in how people buy things has elevated the cargo bike from a niche transport option to a mainstream delivery choice. Cargo bikes offer a win-win solution for cities, residents, safer streets, the environment and businesses alike.
Greening growing industries early is vital to meeting climate targets: With spending habits shifting during the Covid-19 pandemic, providing low-impact and low-emissions solutions for new, expanding markets is essential.
The public sector can be a market maker by enabling transitions: Government and business can work hand-in-hand at a local level to scale up low-impact climate solutions through grant schemes in order to capture the social and commercial benefits. And, mutual learning and collaboration across cities makes roll-out easier.

Friendly regulatory environment bolsters efforts by 70 companies, including Baidu, Alibaba 
By CRAIG S. SMITH 
Chinese tech giant Baidu opened a 2.5-acre test track and operations base for autonomous vehicles last week, its third such site in the country and its latest move to dominate the “robotaxi” industry.
China’s self-driving vehicle market is moving faster than that of the United States thanks to government regulatory support. In the past year, Baidu and AV competitor AutoX, backed by e-commerce giant Alibaba, have announced a series of steps in the race toward what promises to be a massive market.
Swiss bank UBS estimates that by 2030, the global robotaxi market will be worth at least $2 trillion annually, with robotaxi fleet purchases accounting for 12% of all new cars sold.
In April last year, Baidu began offering free robotaxi trips in Changsha within a pre-defined area, followed by Cangzhou and Beijing. Then, in December, AutoX launched a trial of driverless robotaxis in the southern city of Shenzhen and opened that service to the public in January this year. In May, Baidu started commercial robotaxi service within a 1.2 square-mile zone in western Beijing and last month opened a pilot program to the public covering a 60-square-mile district in the southern city of Guangzhou.
The Shanghai operations center will serve as a base for Baidu’s Apollo brand robotaxis, robobuses and other types of autonomous vehicles in the region. The base will collect data and calibrate connected vehicles and act as a remote control center.
“Our base will serve as an intelligent connectivity ecosystem and expand to over 200 operating vehicles to become the largest autonomous driving fleet in East China,” said a Baidu spokesperson.
AutoX opened a robotaxi operations center in Shanghai last year, and has been offering limited robotaxi service to the public in Shanghai for more than a year. The company’s robotaxi service in Shenzhen, meanwhile, operates without a safety driver or operator in the car. “This is still the only fully driverless RoboTaxi operation in China until today,” said Jewel Z. Li, AutoX’s chief operating officer.
This is still the only fully driverless RoboTaxi operation in China until today.
Since Beijing approved self-driving car tests on designated public roads more than three years ago, dozens of cities have awarded pilot program permits to more than 70 companies.
Chinese regulators began allowing limited robotaxi trials June 2019 and this January, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology released a draft policy permitting AV testing on highways with a goal of opening the robotaxi market by 2025.
Baidu has announced plans to deploy 3,000 robotaxis in 30 Chinese cities by the end of 2023. AutoX and WeRide, which is backed by the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, have similarly ambitious goals.
Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-hailing company that has recently faced Chinese regulatory troubles, also operates a fleet of autonomous vehicles.
China is pursuing other self-driving vehicle applications, including autonomous heavy trucks. Baidu is working on a robotic excavator system with the University of Maryland, integrating perception, planning, and control capabilities to enable material loading with no human intervention. The excavation system has been deployed in real-world scenarios, operating continuously for over 24 hours at a time.

 While Back to the Future’s vision of a world with hoverboards and flying cars has yet to come true, transport is changing, and Intelligent Transport Systems are the driving force behind these developments. A new research partnership between the University of the Sunshine Coast (USC) and the Queensland Government will help prepare the state for futuristic transport that uses emerging technologies to better connect people and goods in more sustainable, efficient and convenient ways. 
By Patricia Mae Tagabe

USC Senior Lecturer in Environmental Engineering, Dr Helen Fairweather, said the three-year Transport Academic Partnership, including the Department of Transport and Main Roads’ funding support, was not only exciting for the university’s students and academics, but would also have a profound impact on the wider community and environment.
“Transport is changing rapidly, and we need more research that targets the interface between civil infrastructure and the Internet of Things (IoT),” Dr Fairweather said.
“The key questions are: How do we move people and goods without relying on systems for fuel-emitting cars, and how can technology help us achieve that?
“It’s not just about electric cars and light rail. It’s about how telecommunications and advanced analytics can change how our transport network operates and how more sustainable service can be provided.”
Dr Fairweather said that the specific research projects will be jointly developed with the Department of Transport and Main Roads once a foundation USC Chair of Sustainable Transport Engineering has been appointed at its Moreton Bay campus.
However, initial areas of focus would include the use of big data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart transport.
The Moreton Bay campus will become a field site for testing cutting-edge transport innovations, such as:
♦ New IoT sensor technologies for Intelligent Transport Systems
♦ Advanced video imagery for providing information about vehicle movements and assessing areas of traffic congestion
♦ Access to vehicle-based data to analyse driver and passenger behaviour
♦ Advanced AI to understand differences amongst distinct road user groups in typical traffic situations Dr Fairweather said that Intelligent Transport Systems have delivered important but incremental changes to Australia’s transport systems, and the momentum to advance Australia’s transport technology industries is only growing.
“We are already seeing major changes in terms of the way traffic moves in the cities, e.g. using sensors, CCTV footage and AI to better control traffic lights and variable speed signs to improve traffic flow.
This is providing a 20-30 per cent uplift in capacity for the same infrastructure, supporting more sustainable outcomes,” Dr Fairweather said.
“Electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles will be the single biggest transformation over the coming decade as the technology is proven now, and scale and affordability will come as the volume of sales increase.
“Full situational awareness of the transport network will become more customer focused, enabling customers to make more informed choices around whether to travel, what mode of transport to use, when to travel and what on-trip changes are necessary to optimise their journey.
“There are some innovations in terms of maintenance using video captured by vehicles and AI to improve the response to road maintenance needs.
Flooding alerts in regional areas are becoming more sophisticated which is critical for road users, particularly in preventing motorists from entering flooded roads.”
Predictions for future transport technology innovations
According to Dr Fairweather, futuristic transport technologies are not far on the horizon as we start to see vehicles with connected and autonomous technologies emerging over the next couple of decades.
“Connectivity of vehicles to roadside infrastructure and the ability for vehicles to exchange information and data (talk to each other) is already emerging in Europe, USA and Asia.
These technologies will be critical in improving safety and will be important in the roadmap to full automation,” Dr Fairweather said.
“Depending on how this is rolled out between industry suppliers, government regulators and road authorities, this is likely to blur the current distinction between private vehicle ownership and public transport.
“The Mobility as a Service (MAAS) model, where people subscribe to a suite of transport options and pay a monthly fee as opposed to having to own anything, could therefore become a viable service offering.
This subscription package would include access to everything – public transport, e-transport (e.g.. electric scooters), cars, buses, trains etc.
“I do see a time when we will be able to use personal mobility options for first and last mile transport between major bus and rail networks, though active transport (e.g. cycling and walking) provides a better option in terms of public health outcomes.”
Dr Fairweather said one potential technology of the future could consist of multi-purpose on-demand freight/passenger options with ‘capsules’ linked to a trackless tram-type system.
Each business might be able to call for a ‘freight capsule’ to go past their door, or use drones to transport lighter freight to the nearest capsule.
Perhaps the capsule can be configured quickly to change from a transport to a freight option to optimise its use. “Overall, autonomous public transport options will be cheaper to run and will become more accessible to regional communities, lessening their reliance on private vehicles, while big data analytics and AI will provide for more optimum traffic networks in the future,” Dr Fairweather said.
“In terms of sustainability, I think there will be a greater focus on the fuels and construction materials we’re using, Building Information Modelling (BIM) to conceive, design, build and manage transport infrastructure, transition to more active transport and better understanding of the socio-economic aspects of equity when it comes to access to public transport options.”
Collaboration key to improving Australia’stransport networks
Transport and Main Roads Minister, Mark Bailey, said the Queensland Government welcomed the opportunity to work with USC and look ahead at new, innovative ideas that would enable all Australians to move more safely, efficiently, and sustainably through the nation’s transport networks.
“This partnership will enable USC to research and provide insights into the type of technologies we will use to move from A to B in the next few decades,” Mr Bailey said.
“Queensland is well placed to be at the forefront of transport innovation. I look forward to the team’s work exploring how future technology can boost our capability to deliver a single, integrated transport network accessible to everyone.”
Dr Fairweather agreed that Queensland is well placed to be at the forefront of transport innovation compared to other states because the Department of Transport and Main Roads understands the importance of partnering with academia to accelerate the development and deployment of technologies that will shape the future of transport.
“The department has positioned itself to undertake and make use of the latest cutting-edge research in the transport field through their investment in a Transport Academic Partnerships across Brisbane Partner Universities, with the intent to extend that to other regional universities,” Dr Fairweather said.
“They are very mindful that the skills required of their workforce is rapidly changing and the university partnerships will be critical to providing the courses for this upskilling.
“They also make an active investment in applied research programs so they can continue to improve, adapt and adopt new ways of doing things.”
As part of a Transport Academic Partnership, Department of Transport and Main Roads will provide advice on their research needs to ensure the research projects align with their strategic plan and the Queensland Government priorities of supporting economic activity and job creation, improving community safety and protecting the environment.
“Through this research partnership, civil infrastructure and IoT will become better integrated by developing and deploying the appropriate and fit-for-use technology and communication protocols to protect individual privacy and maximise cyber security, while providing the analytics to make a major shift in the development and operation of our transport infrastructure,” Dr Fairweather said.

The adoption of new-age technologies and systems that are more resilient to uncertainties can make a difference to automotive companies and industry as a whole.
By  Rupak Rathore 
The automobile sector has been adversely impacted by the sudden disruption caused by the pandemic and associated lockdown last year. It recorded a drop in sales across segments and manufacturing as well as supply chains broke down. However, the industry started showing early signs of recovery with an increase in month over month sales in the latter half of 2020.
While the second wave once again affected the automotive sector adversely, it has reaffirmed the need for the sector to focus on aggressive adoption of new-age technologies and create systems more resilient to uncertainties. The following are ways by which some of the 21st century’s emerging digital technologies can make a difference to automotive companies.
Robotic Process Automation (RPA):
Process automation using digital workers brings increased accuracy. Be it the regulatory compliance, interpretability of paper into the digitized medium, machine dismantling and assembling, or inventory management, RPA has come a long way to ensure near quasi perfect accuracy. These software robots are programmed with suitable algorithms to perform a particular task. Once the robots are well trained, these tasks are automated. These digital workers are getting increasingly sophisticated with a combination of Machine Learning and Image Processing algorithms.
Big Data:
Big Data in the automobile industry can help with customer retention through improved after-sales services. While the profit margins for the dealer vary with vehicle models, it is the after-sales services and periodic maintenance from which they earn a sizeable profit. The need of the hour is personalized services to forge great relationships with customers. Big Data helps to analyse the buyer’s likings and preferences for recommending a customized offering for a particular customer. Big Data can also predict probable wear and tear, after which a damaged part (of the vehicle) can cause an interruption in daily use or complete breakdown. It also alerts the driver by segmenting and analysing his driving patterns and habits that can cause an accident. Big Data can also be used for improving vehicle design, as it can give insights into how the vehicle/component performs in market conditions.
Cloud Computing:
Cloud computing can assist automotive companies by reducing the onsite IT hardware costs of an organisation, especially in terms of power consumption and hardware repair, depreciation and labour. Cloud computing can improve the efficiency of GPS and entertainment systems installed in the car. Cars can become smart and perceptive vehicles equipped to tackle varied road and traffic situations. However, such controls and continuous information feed requires perpetual and on-demand predisposition of systems that can only happen with the help of the cloud. Furthermore, data forms the core of numerous functions in the automobile industry, and it is directly proportional to the manufacturing of a vehicle model. The data from various departments need to be collaborated to produce the perfect model.
Predictive and Advanced Data Analytics:
Predictive and advanced data analytics can help in product quality management, product recall and improved customer satisfaction. Predictive analytics can help the quality management teams to process a large set of information (historical) that can reveal the underlying cause. It allows for the early detection of issues and minimises the probability of their occurrence in the future. Data can also facilitate in improving the safety of the vehicle – both during design and while being driven. Furthermore, it assures a better and more efficient recall process.
Artificial Intelligence:
AI is impacting the automobile industry in a big way. It can alert the drivers of a hazardous situation or component failure well before the scenario turns fatal. AI can also assist in the quality inspection that is a time-consuming process.
Integration of Telematics and Health:
As vehicles become more integrated with smartphones and wearables, avenues for improving emergency response – using a combination of telematics, vehicle sensors and wearables – emerge, which can save precious lives. Overall road safety can be improved by using Car2X frameworks for inter-vehicle communication.
Virtual Reality:
Virtual Reality is of great help to companies, dealers and customers alike. It helps automobile engineers to work together remotely (especially in the designing process). The design process on the physical mock-up requires massive resources and is time-consuming too. Furthermore, it reduces the need to create a prototype after every examination stage. The technology also helps the customers to get a feel of their new automobile without its physical body. Through virtual reality, they can get an immersive digital buying experience. A leading data and vehicle visualisation platform reported that as many as 76 lakh Indians chose to experience the features of their next car in 3D on the internet in 2020. VR has proven to be a boon for dealers during the prevalence of COVID-19, they have been able to continue with their business despite the logistic challenges and scarcity of resources. It is difficult for dealers to have a physical model of every specification as most of the manufacturers regularly launch restyled and remodelled versions. Customers always want to buy the most recent model. The use of VR can prove to be a better, immersive, and persuasive way to speed up their decision making. This is an ideal, win-win situation for both the customers and dealers.
Augmented Reality:
Augmented Reality provides a realistic feel for testing the critical functions and capabilities of a vehicle. The conventional method of testing requires extensive physical trials, which is expensive and cumbersome. With AR, engineers can build a prototype, have an easier time with critical logistics and technical checkpoints and can implement modifications in lesser time. Speedier production, more innovation and reduced cost would be possible with the integration of this technology.
While it is projected that the global automotive industry will grow to just under nine trillion U.S. dollars by 2030, an Invest India report suggests that the automobile industry may reach the 300 million dollar mark by 2026. However for the sector to script the kind of growth post-pandemic recovery, digital integration is a must.

In order to restore vitality to urban areas, authorities will need to focus on reducing carbon emissions.Transforming the transportation sector will be particularly important, write two experts from the International Finance Corporation.The World Bank has released steps for sustainable financing strategies, which include investment reviews and cash injections into public transit.These are stepping stones to a greener, resilient and inclusive urban recovery from COVID-19.
Rapid movement of people and goods has always defined thriving cities. But the COVID-19 pandemic slowed much of that movement, and the way forward is uncertain. One thing is clear, efforts to restore vitality to urban areas need to be tempered with a profound willingness to rebuild in a less carbon-intensive manner.As municipal leaders tackle the challenges of leading their cities out of crisis mode, the transportation sector will play a key role in a greener, resilient and inclusive recovery. Smart transportation planning can create jobs and lay the groundwork for sustainable urban growth.An IFC analysis found that cities that prioritize green transportation stand to gain from an investment opportunity of as much as $2.7 trillion. It is estimated that the green transportation sector will create some 53 million direct jobs across emerging market countries by 2030. As urbanization accelerates around the world, it is more important than ever that transit systems reduce their carbon-dependency . Well-planned urban transit is a critical component of the world-wide effort to stem climate change.
The COVID-19 crisis presented significant challenges to municipal transit operators. As ridership rates fell between 50 percent and 90 percent, mass transit operators were forced to bear substantial costs for salaries and system maintenance. There is little doubt that a strong demand for mass transit will return. Mass transit is the most affordable option for the vast majority of the world’s urban residents, and it is essential that all transit services are safe, reliable and eco-friendly. Given the essential role public transport plays in emerging market economies, governmental support for both public and private operators is crucial to sustain operations in the short term and improve service levels in the long term.
The World Bank has published steps for sustainable financing strategies, including investment reviews and cash injections. The challenge for rapidly growing cities in lower-income countries is particularly severe, as scaling public transit requires keeping prices low. Subsidies are usually required to improve services and invest in technology, and finding the resources to subsidies can be difficult.
One step which urban leaders can take now is to improve access to electric vehicles (EVs). For example, IFC supported Ukraine’s Galnaftogaz (GNG), the country’s leading retail distributor of transportation fuels, to help promote electric passenger vehicles uptake by investing in fast-charging stations. The project will enable the company to avoid annual greenhouse gas emissions of around 4,990 tons of carbon dioxide. Increasing the proportion of EVs on the road makes urban air cleaner for everyone. (Transport pollution is a major contributor to respiratory illness in cities around the world).
Municipalities can work with the private sector to invest in EV charging stations and other EV infrastructure. With appropriate zoning modifications, EV infrastructure can be built near bus and rail hubs, where it can serve mass transit and commercial delivery needs.
New bus rapid transit systems, also called BRTs, are another affordable and flexible way to improve urban transit while also stimulating the local economy. Carefully planned stations, digital ticketing and platform-level boarding make for easy and efficient loading and unloading of people and goods.
It is crucial to ensure that public transit remains a reliable and practical option for everyone, including those who use mobility devices and push strollers. BRTs typically replace old buses with new fleets that may feature intelligent transportation systems, which allows system operators to improve rider satisfaction and reduce traffic congestion. Dedicated smartphone apps allow riders to plan their journeys with precision. System operators can use this data to optimize bus schedules and operations for efficiency.
In 2021, IFC helped the city of Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine to develop and introduce a smart city platform, as well as modernize and upgrade its public transport system. IFC’s EUR35 million investment will help the municipality rehabilitate up to 2 kilometers of roads on one of the city’s center streets, purchase modern battery-electric trolleybuses and electric buses, and upgrade the electric transport infrastructure.
The project will help reduce traffic congestion and pollution in urban areas, optimize traffic management, and provide better digital services to ensure the quality and sustainability of communal services.
Although mass transit usage declined during the pandemic, increased reliance on e-commerce resulted in a massive surge of urban delivery traffic. Last-mile delivery companies scrambled to meet an increase in demand without sacrificing their own efficiency. In the process, many of these companies invested in smart tracking systems and upgraded their intelligent routing and fleet management software.
The surge in demand for clean, cost-effective last-mile delivery solutions has created an unprecedented opportunity for cities to forge alliances with the private sector. Cities can lead the way by designing clean transit solutions which work for businesses and local residents . In emerging markets, two and three-wheeled EV logistics, which are already becoming cost competitive with fossil fuel options, can be encouraged.
What’s the World Economic Forum doing about the future of cities?
Journeys may change, but the importance of rapid movement within cities will remain. Advances in data management software and intelligent traffic systems allow municipalities to control both traffic and pollution more effectively than ever before.
IFC can help plan and finance transit projects as cities plan their emergence from unprecedented crisis. We have the tools to ensure that recovery plans continue the global effort to reduce climate change.
The silver lining of the COVID-19 crisis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rethink the world’s cities. New technologies enable cities to plan and rebuild greener and smarter than ever before. Deploying transport solutions driven by smart technologies and innovative tools will be key to build healthy, thriving post-pandemic cities where people and goods move with ease.

 AI has a pivotal role to play in revolutionizing the logistics industry.
By Madhurjya Chowdhury

Everything grew increasingly digital as a result of globalization; consumers began to buy more online and expect their products or services to be delivered faster and for less money. In today’s fast-paced world, logistics and supply chains must adapt to quickly changing consumer demands. As per ML news, supply chains waste hours each day on paperwork, resulting in a yearly loss of more than $170,000. Using AI for some of the jobs is one approach to improve the issue. Transferring certain manual activities to machines can help alleviate the problem of paper-based paperwork while also increasing productivity. In this article, you will explore how AI is contributing to the logistics industry.
AI Impact on Logistics
Artificial intelligence has radically altered the logistics and supply chain industries. Here are five ways that AI-driven technology may help businesses enhance and innovate their logistics and supply chain operations.
1. Robotics
Robotics refers to the use of intelligent machines in the supply chain management process. As per Statista research, revenues of logistics service robotics would reach more than $6 billion in 2021. Robots can generally do routine operations such as delivery, transportation, storing, picking, packaging, and routing. The primary distinction between regular industrial robots and AI-assisted robots is that the latter can execute more complicated jobs without the need for human intervention. Smart robots may also evolve by learning new tasks and executing increasingly complicated behaviors. It means that this gear can partially, and in some circumstances completely, replace humans in the distribution process, making it more predictable, simple to regulate, and successful. Drones, for example, may transport a certain amount of load and can fly or move on land or water. RFID (radio-frequency identification) solutions can sort, identify, and deliver items through the warehouse autonomously. As a result, robotics in logistics can boost production while also making it easier for humans to manage the various phases of delivery.
2. Autonomous Vehicles
Autonomous vehicles have the potential to dramatically improve delivery efficiency. This technology has the potential to improve dependability, cost efficiency, and predictability. Even though we have yet to acquire completely autonomous delivery vehicles, it is just a matter of time. As technology advances, it is conceivable to anticipate that in the not-too-distant future, consumers will get their shipments without the need for human intervention. According to the Mckinsey research, autonomous vehicles, especially drones, will deliver over 80% of all packages. By overcoming transportation obstacles and inconveniences, this technology will improve the efficiency of the distribution process.
3. Computer Vision
Every vision system is made up of two major components: the camera and the “brain” computer that controls everything. Based on a sophisticated algorithm, it can detect objects, goods, particular activities, colors, and perform actions. This technology may be used to identify damage and increase productivity in the production process. Amazon, for example, employs a computer vision-based AI system to offload a trailer of merchandise in 30 minutes rather than the hours it would take without it.
Furthermore, computer vision-enabled systems can automatically detect damage, determining the cause of the damage, its severity, and taking steps to prevent future cargo mishaps. The loading and unloading of products is another application of computer vision. This technology not only recognizes and locates items and packages in the store, but it also does so autonomously. With this in mind, machine learning systems are extensively utilized to reduce customer churn, improve supply chain quality, and improve the delivery process’s security.
4. Predictive Analysis
Any logistics firm must be able to function efficiently, deliver on time, and save transportation expenses. To accomplish this, an in-depth study based on historical data is required to detect risk trends, implement corrective steps, and generate projections. You can only dramatically enhance logistics operations, modify shipment patterns, offer on delivery, and forecast consumer behavior by utilizing predictive analysis. MHI Annual Industry Survey for 2020 stated that the percentage of logistics companies using predictive analysis took a flight from 17% in 2017 to 30% in 2019. It can not only improve supply chain visibility, optimize routes, and make tracking and planning shipments easier, but it can also identify unexpected circumstances and hazards. If properly implemented, it will considerably decrease operating expenses and assist businesses in making more informed decisions.
5. Big Data
Logistics, like every other business, generate a considerable volume of data. It would have been more difficult to handle all of this material without a well-maintained data management system. Companies can save money and avoid late shipments and deliveries by collecting data from multiple sources such as drivers’ applications, devices, and systems, and assessing how various elements impact the delivery process. You may obtain insight into historical delivery statistics, driver ratings, and make changes using big data analytics. More than 91% of Fortune 1000 firms, according to the study, are investing in big data. Furthermore, AI-driven data analytics enables businesses to account for variables such as fleet maintenance schedules, vehicle sensors, inclement weather, and fuel costs. It not only provides drivers with destination ideas and helps them travel more effectively, but it also allows businesses to reduce logistical expenses on a route-by-route basis.
Conclusion
By bringing new methods of dealing with data and improvements across the whole supply chain, AI is changing logistics procedures. Predictive analysis, robots, computer vision, deep learning, and autonomous vehicles are examples of technology that can greatly improve logistics and supply chain performance. They have the ability to alter the way items are managed in warehouses, as well as optimize last-mile delivery and logistics networks. With this in mind, logistics and supply chain firms could consider these technologies as a means of enhancing efficiency and lowering costs.

Charging infrastructure can take up to 2 years to install
By Brian Straight  
Supply  chain issues may be pushing back deliveries of electric vehicles, but  that doesn’t mean last-mile delivery fleets looking to adopt can sit  back and wait.
“Fleets may think they have plenty of time … but 
sometimes it will take one to two years for the infrastructure upgrades 
from the utility,” explained Greg Hintler, U.S. managing director for The Mobility House,
 an EV charging infrastructure company. “If you want to have electric 
vehicles in two years, you should have already started or need to be 
getting started now.”
Hintler said he has heard from several 
companies that were promised EV delivery vans this year, but suppliers 
are pushing back those delivery timelines as much as two years.
“What
 we’ve heard from fleets, what we’ve heard from OEMs is there are 
massive supply chain challenges and what that translates to is very few 
vehicles being delivered at the moment,” he said. “A lot of fleets are 
hearing deliveries are being pushed to the end of the year, and the 
reality is it will be 2023.”
The Mobility House focuses on 
building out charging infrastructure. Among its clients are the Austrian
 Postal Service and the Irish Postal Service. Hintler said its customer 
base now crosses 800 fleets in the U.S. and Europe.
“Because we 
are playing both in the United States and Europe, we can … get a preview
 of what’s to come,” he said while speaking to Modern Shipper from 
Germany. “Here in Europe, they are so far ahead compared to what we are 
seeing in the U.S. However, we have commitments now from the major 
players. We know it is going to come in the U.S. and come quickly. There
 is a ton of demand. Demand isn’t the issue, it’s on the supply chain.”
Delays
 are being caused by many of the same issues affecting traditional 
automotive lines — semiconductors — as well as port congestion. In 
addition, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has strained steel supplies 
globally, with about one-third of European steel coming from plants in 
Ukraine.
“On top of that, the enormous uptake in demand, whether 
it is because of government regulation or corporate [goals] … has become
 a global challenge and all the suppliers are trying to allocate the 
little product they can get pretty evenly,” he said.
Power needs are not a major concern
One
 of the big questions around the deployment of electric vehicles is the 
strain they could place on the existing electric grid. Hintler said 
companies like The Mobility House are working with all stakeholders to 
ensure power needs are met.
“There have been many studies that 
show the generation — the amount of electricity needed — is not the 
issue, it’s the demand,” he said. “What’s important is that the 
infrastructure is built intelligently … to dampen that effect from 
electric vehicles on the grid.”
Hintler pointed to smart charging systems and managing charging time as potential solutions.
“How
 can we charge during times when there is a lot of renewable [energy] 
generation and how can we reduce the charging at times when there are 
extra stresses on the grid?” he asked. “If you control [the generation],
 those electric vehicles will be part of the solution and part of the 
future of the electric grid.”
The last-mile race
There
 are a number of vehicle makers looking to gain leverage in the 
last-mile delivery space. GM-backed BrightDrop, Amazon-funded Rivian, 
Ford and a host of other smaller firms are all battling for pieces of 
the global electric delivery van market.
With expected growth of 17% annually
 until 2030, the EV market is poised for a massive breakthrough in the 
years to come. Hintler said last-mile delivery firms are waiting, but 
some challenges remain.
“Pretty much everyone knows that electric 
is going to be the future, and most players, especially in the last-mile
 delivery and the fleet space, know that whoever figures out how to 
deploy electric vehicles at scale first will have a massive competitive 
advantage,” he said. “So there is a true race on the ground that 

 what is taking place in the media.
“What is not being 
discussed but we hear about is the challenges,” Hintler added, pointing 
to the complexity of current systems and the complexity of working with 
utilities among them. “The industry is still nascent and learning a 
lot.”
Among the complexities is the fact that not only is one 
industry being disrupted, but EVs are trying to disrupt two global 
industries at once.
“This is going to be the biggest teamwork and 
team task challenge of our generation,” Hintler said. “This is a massive
 transition, not within one industry but two industries. We not only are
 transitioning the automotive industry, we are transitioning the 
electric industry.”
OEMs challenged
Rivian
 has faced recent skepticism on its ability to ultimately deliver on the
 100,000 EV order from Amazon. The company has faced a series of 
problems, including the ability to get semiconductors. According to a 
recent Forbes article, the company cut its 2022 production target in half to 25,000 vehicles and expects an operating loss.
BrightDrop,
 which has orders for tens of thousands of its electric vans from 
companies such as FedEx, Verizon and Walmart, may be better situated to 
thrive as semiconductors become available thanks to GM’s backing. The 
same goes for Ford, although Hintler said he asked a customer about an 
expected delivery of hundreds of Ford E-Transit vans and the customer 
had only received three so far.
“They were hearing the end of the year,” he said.
The big advice Hintler wanted to impart on fleets looking to adopt was to seek out technologies that are neutral.
“In  a nascent market where you don’t know which players are going to be  around for long or which companies are going to succeed, you want to be  sure you use interoperability solutions, both on the hardware side and  the [technology] side,” he said, noting that more suppliers are  delivering common component options. “There is definitely a drive toward  interoperability as a whole, but still some players are propagating  proprietary systems.”

The e-hailing industry is expected to develop at a CAGR between 15 to 28 per cent, resulting in an increased market size of $285bn by 2030
By NICHOLAS WATSONMAY
If there’s one thing everyone agrees on in the aftermath of the pandemic, it’s that mobility as we know it has irrevocably changed. The transportation industry had already been disrupted by technology before 2020, with ride-hailing apps allowing commuters to have more control over their movements.
However, the pandemic transformed that experience into one of necessity and convenience. Add in the fact that, close to 20 per cent of the global workforce was told to work from home for the foreseeable future in the early months of the pandemic – the overall impact on the transportation sector cannot be understated.
According to a report published by Arthur D. Little in 2020, the lockdown reduced overall mobility demand in the US by up to 90 per cent, with 40-70 per cent reductions persisting during the recovery period. As people attempt to preserve social distance during journeys, this has been accompanied by increased personal mobility (cycling, walking, vehicles).
Before the pandemic, urban mobility demand was expected to expand exponentially, with urbanisation continuing and global demand for passenger mobility in urbanised regions expected to double by 2050 compared to 2010. Research indicates the pandemic had little effect on this growth tendency since the city population continued to expand faster than the overall growth of the global population.
That’s where mobility on demand (MoD) and mobility as a service comes into the spotlight. MoD is a new way of travelling that combines several easily accessible means of transportation to make an individual’s journeys more efficient. MoD is entirely based on technology, enabling people to be better informed of available options and make them more productive with their time.
Private firms, public entities, startups, and mobile apps such as ride-hailing apps and car-share providers, which cut out the middlemen and use independent contractors, provide solutions that facilitate MoD today. MoD dispels the myth that the only efficient way to travel anywhere – whether locally or internationally – is to own a vehicle or pay large sums to rent. The ownership trend is quickly giving way to usership or partnership. With a growing number of environmentally concerned young people entering the workforce and a high reliance on digital assets, MoD provides them the satisfaction of reducing their carbon footprint.
The sharing economy is all about fractionalisation and digitalisation of assets or services. Every sector is undergoinga digital transformation and re-thinking business and revenue models to engage with more customers regularly. With cars, particularly in the context of car sharing, an ‘illiquid asset’, that is, one that is ordinarily only available to one person is fractionalised through digitalisation into a car that is measured and priced by minute or meter and may be driven by anyone with a license.
Additionally, with ride-hailing industries, the expense or requirement of a license is removed because the customer receives the added benefit of a driver for the customer, allowing for even more micro-mobility access. According to another report by Arthur D. Little, the e-hailing industry is expected to develop at a CAGR between 15 to 28 per cent, resulting in an increased market size of $285bn by 2030. Primary drivers of this growth will be the lower rate of car ownership among millennials and the expected progressive integration of ride-hailing into other solutions, which include car sharing and bike sharing.
In a McKinsey survey of the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and China, it was discovered that key factors related to health and hygiene changed how private and business trips were now chosen. The cost of a trip was no longer as important as staying safe from health hazards. While the world shifts from CAPEX to OPEX and from ownership to usership, the ‘Netflix’ generation in the GCC is more interested in consumption than long-term acquisition. As automobiles become fully autonomous, car sharing, and ride-hailing will merge. Car sharing providers are already developing products to prepare for this, giving them more opportunities to scale horizontally and vertically while also providing an already experienced customer with more options. This will significantly influence the GCC, where young people who want to live aspirational lives are already establishing themselves.
Before the sharing economy, people were unable to engage due to the lack of infrastructure, and the high cost of current modes of transportation. A trip from Deira to Expo 2020 used to cost a minimum of Dhs120, but now only costs Dhs40, thanks to car sharing. And yet, there is still a long way to go.
In the UAE, the car-sharing to passenger car market has a penetration rate of 0.05 per cent. This is a twelve-fold decrease from Tallinn’s (in Estonia) 0.64 per cent and Moscow’s 0.87 per cent. Nonetheless, the UAE is seen as a more digitally savvy populace with higher internet penetration than most countries. The UAE has approximately 1,000 car-sharing cars today, while Moscow has 36,000. According to research conducted by car-sharing companies, the short-term potential is roughly 8,000 vehicles, with a long-term prospect of over 30,000 vehicles over the next five years.
The potential of the mobility market is enormous. The key to growth is an ecosystem approach and technology enablement. Only a business model based on partnerships and scalability can achieve sustainable development. People were previously unable to make trips that could not be completed by walking or cycling due to a lack of a practical mobility alternative. According to European statistics, one car-sharing vehicle replaces 17 cars that would otherwise take up parking spots, waste fuel, and emit carbon.
Finally, technology can help stream-line an experience, changing the dynamics of the business model and revenue/cost streams in the process. The question to consider for newcomers to the market is whether they can generate a million dollars from a million customers or ten customers? Which route is the best option if they can do this with ease and with an excellent interface? One option has a lower risk of losing a customer, but the other has a higher revenue loss. The challenge then is to build a service or platform that can appeal to customers across the market while providing five-star services for everyone.

 The shared e-scooter could become as common on city streets as a bus, or even cars, according to those in the industry. 
By Skip Descant 
The shared e-scooter could become as common on city streets as a bus, or even cars, according to those in the industry.
“What
 was new, and kind of different over the last five years or so, scooters
 have become much more mainstream,” said Ashwini Chhabra, chief public 
policy officer at TIER Mobility, the world’s largest shared 
micromobility operator. The company recently acquired Spin. 
“They’ve  become more like how cities approached bike-share. And I think that  transition will continue to where I think these services will be  embraced much in the way that the city bus is considered to be as  American as the library and the post office,” Chhabra added, speaking on  a panel discussion last month at the CoMotion MIAMI conference. “It may  have started out as a private service, but it provides a public service  for a lot of our riders.” 
As anyone who follows urban mobility 
will tell you, e-scooters arrived on the scene about five years ago. 
They have weathered the rapid head-turning — and often criticism — from 
everyone from city officials to residents, who have both embraced and 
balked at these new mobility gadgets. Since then, regulations have been 
put in place, data sharing has been established, and most importantly, 
partnerships have taken root among scooter operators and other mobility 
providers like ride-hailing and transit. 
It is this evolution 
that most excites industry watchers like Chhabra, who pointed to the 
merging of micromobility with transit in a number of European cities as 
the kind of trend we could — and should — see in the U.S. 
“And 
so, there is this realization at some point, that you are actually 
growing the size of the pie by facilitating these introductions,” said 
Chhabra. 
To
 form those partnerships means “getting the digital right,” said 
Chhabra. But also, thinking through issues like the locations of 
mobility hubs, the placement of transit stops and the development of 
micromobility infrastructure like protected bike lanes. 
“The  places where we’ve seen the most successful programs are those where  MaaS [mobility as a service] and multimodality doesn’t exist  independently, but is part of a broader initiative to repurpose streets,  repurpose parking, away from car utilization alone,” said Chhabra. 
Merging  micromobility and transit can help regions meet some of the larger  transportation goals, particularly when thinking about sustainability or  equity, said Carlos Cruz-Casas, chief innovation officer of the  Miami-Dade County Department of Transportation and Public Works, adding  that incentivizing bikes and e-bikes could help riders travel farther  than they would on a scooter, and help to bring about other health  outcomes. 
“The more modes the better,” said Cruz-Casas, in some of his comments on the panel. 
He also noted transit agencies are taking on more modes under their operations 
“Bike-share
 started out as a private service. It’s quasi-public in many places now.
 And I can see a day when it’s much more akin to a bus service, because 
cities realize, this is actually a necessary service people are looking 
to us to provide,” he added. 
Other cities like Denver have taken a
 slightly different approach to encourage the use of micromobility. The 
city and county government recently launched a program to provide cash 
rebates for residents buying an e-bike or e-cargo bike. After only three
 weeks the city limited the program when it reached capacity. 
“The
 program has reached the maximum number of rebates that funding with 
allow,” Winna MacLaren, manager of communications and engagement in the 
Office of Climate Action, Sustainability and Resiliency in the city and 
county of Denver told Government Technology. The office will monitor how
 many of the vouchers are redeemed, and will “resume the program once we
 know how much funding remains after the initial rebate redemption 
period ends. 
“We
 do not anticipate all of the rebates that were issued in the first 
three weeks of the program will be redeemed. We also do have funding for
 a full second and third year of the program,” MacLaren added. 
The  vouchers provided $400 for an e-bike, or $900 toward the purchase of an  electric cargo bike. The rebates were higher for residents qualifying  as low income. Consequently, some 40 percent of the applicants were  “income-qualified,” said MacLaren.

The  car-sharing venture formed by BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz AG will be owned  by Stellantis. The move comes along as the automakers struggle to make  the business profitable. All the automakers involved in the deal did not  disclose any price details. Currently, the business has around 3.4  million customers across 16 European cities.
With this move, Stellantis aims to have new streams of revenue as it shifts to electric vehicles. Also, for BMW
 and Mercedes, this move is another step in reshaping mobility 
offerings. Back in 2018, the automakers combined and started the 
services to compete with providers like Uber to save costs. Now, the 
challenges to making the services profitable without the requisite scale
 continue. So they decided to sell the business, according to Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, Stellantis has increased its presence effectively since 
its formation. It has been working on getting younger buyers to try its 
brand and keeping up with changing mobility needs. The share Now 
service, currently available in European countries, was added to 
long-term rental options. Various models like Minis and Mercedes-Benz A-Class were made available for rentals through apps. However, there have been struggles to make it profitable.
Estimates
While the companies didn’t disclose the price, Juergen Pieper, an 
analyst at Bankhaus Metzler, said it would likely be below 500 million 
euros ($525 million), and perhaps around 250 million euros. Pieper 
estimates Share Now has lost around 200 million euros annually, the 
analyst said via email. “Maybe Stellantis with its low financial 
investment and a leaner cost structure can make more out of it,” Pieper 
said. Volkswagen AG, Stellantis’ biggest European rival, is closing in 
on the acquisition of Europcar as part of a broader push to create a 
sprawling mobility services platform. A consortium led by the German 
industrial giant expects the deal to be completed before the end of the 
second quarter.
Free2Move has around 2 million customers for its app-based parking,  leasing, and rental services. Share Now provides so-called free-floating  car-sharing services in 16 European cities and has around 3.4 million  customers.  Over the next decade, Stellantis intends to expand  Free2move’s presence worldwide, growing it to 15 million active users  and achieving net revenues of 2.8 billion euros. The acquisition comes a  little over a year after the mega-merger between Fiat Chrysler and PSA  Group to form a sprawling manufacturer across 14 brands with nameplates  like Jeep, Ram, and Fiat to add scale to the shift toward electric  vehicles and autonomous driving.

By Shubhankar GautamTime loss due to traffic jams, rising levels of environmental pollution, an increasing number of fatalities, some of the many woes of urban commuting. Enter smart mobility, a solution based on the use of different modes of transportation instead of one’s personal vehicle. This concept, which runs on the use of carpooling, ridesharing, and bike commuting, has taken cities by storm. Not only that, this market is expected to grow further still though things have been going a little downhill since the advent of the pandemic.
Impact of COVID-19 on the Smart Mobility Market: An Analysis
2020 has been a grim year for all industrial sectors, especially the smart mobility market. The primary reason for the downfall of the smart mobility market can be attributed to a decline in demand for carpooling and ridesharing services across the world, owing to safety concerns.
While it is true that the market is expected to experience even slower growth during 2021, industry experts expect to see the curve rising from the year 2022 onwards. This forecast is based on the belief that adequate safety measures will be introduced for carpooling and ridesharing, such as the placement of plastic barriers between the car’s driver and its passengers.
Factors Affecting the Growth of Smart Mobility
The application of electricity to transportation and the use of carpooling are not novel concepts. In fact, the first Electric Vehicle (EV) was introduced in the US as early as 1889, and by the early 1900s, nearly one-third of the vehicles on the American streets were electricity-powered. It was not until the 1930s that cheap Texas oil made EVs a thing of the past. However, here we stand at the cusp of another golden age wherein EVs and smart mobility are bound to become an essential part of the future.
Having said that, it is natural for one to ask about the significant factors influencing the smart mobility market. The factors may either be drivers or barriers that need to be dealt with the innovation and a common purpose to turn the idea of smart mobility into a living reality.
#1 The Way People Viewed Vehicles are Changing
It was only a few decades back that owning a private car was every family’s dream. Mass production of automobiles and budget-friendly fuel prices brought this ideal within the reach of the average citizen, and as a result, vehicle-centric urban design and personal, door-to-door transportation became the norm.
Today, the scenario is much different. The present millennial-led era prefers not to own a car; instead, this young generation of commuters is shifting in favor of ridesharing services such as Uber or Lyft – they prefer to subscribe to a car-sharing service rather than bear the cost of a personal car, which includes fuel and maintenance costs. Is it any surprise that such new vehicle usage patterns will encourage the growth of the smart mobility market?
#2 Technology is Advancing at a Lightning-Fast Pace
From autonomous vehicles that are smart enough to run on their own to smart parking systems that make the tedious task of parking a piece of cake, technology is the key driver of the smart mobility market. The hyper-connectivity offered by the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G will make it easier for cities to manage traffic, cut down environmental pollution, and make better use of infrastructure. Commuters can have real-time information for smoother and safer transit.
Then, with the use of self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles and drone deliveries, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) predicts that the world may see a whopping 90% reduction in traffic deaths, a 40% reduction in travel time, and a 500% increase in lane capacity. Does it get any smarter than this!
#3 Low Rate of Internet Penetration in Developing Regions
Here’s a barrier to entry for smart mobility systems in full force. Now, the use of ridesharing services requires the involvement of three parties, namely the rider, the driver, and the service provider. The entire process of matching riders with drivers, fare estimation and ride payment are to be carried out via smartphone apps, which in turn require good internet connectivity. 
Unfortunately, some regions, such as Burundi, Chad, and Somalia, among others, have extremely low internet penetration that hinders the development of smart mobility systems in such countries. Once the proper infrastructure for connectivity has been established, the dream of smart mobility can proceed onwards.
#4 An Entirely New Infrastructure and Value Chain is Needed
As much as IoT requires proper infrastructure for connectivity, so does the use of Electric Vehicles require ubiquitous charging infrastructure. The current scenario is pretty awkward wherein potential EV drivers do not see an infrastructure that allows them to buy an EV and drive with confidence, and on the other hand, potential infrastructure providers do not see mass demand insight. Until the time charging stations become as common as gas stations are today, this one barrier-to-entry will make the adoption of EVs a far-fetched dream.
#5 Another Major Driver is Government Policies
Central, state, and city governments can join hands to speed up the adoption of smart mobility systems. Although several US state governments have already directed their focus towards measures such as tax credits and rebates to make smart mobility more affordable for early adopters and are also imposing strict vehicle emission standards for automobile manufacturers, the need of the hour is to offer exclusive EV parking in congested areas, and establishment of ZEZs or Zero Emission Zones wherein traffic will be restricted to bikes, pedestrians, delivery vehicles, and electric vehicles – measures already in place by the city governments of London, Brussels, Paris, and Madrid. Such government policies are sure to accelerate the growth of the smart mobility market.
Top Companies Expected to Dominate the Smart Mobility Market
To create technologically evolved smart mobility solutions, companies need to come up with products that are developed from a long-term market perspective as opposed to short-term creations. This is because as the smart mobility market is set in stone and matures, consumers will naturally demand integrated solutions – a mix of travel services with ancillary services.
As of now, the following companies are expected to take the lead in the future smart mobility market –
CiscoMaaS Global OySiemensTomTom InternationalInnoviz Technologies Inc.Toyota Motor CorporationFord Motor Company, among others.
Despite its present sluggish growth, smart mobility will be a factor in customer preference, changing the way people travel. It’s only a matter of time before this service model comes to the mainstream, and come it will, reaching its projected growth of $70.46 billion by the year 2027.

Ever since the SF Park smart parking system of San Francisco was introduced in 2011, constant improvements have been made and milestones achieved. For instance, the SF Park system automatically adjusts the parking meter rates based on the traffic flow. Since the system was implemented to distribute parking evenly, the hourly rates rise or fall to fill up or empty parking spaces, keeping in mind the traffic conditions on the streets. But, how bad was the traffic issue for San Francisco’s motorists that the city needed such a radical change and how has such change progressed? Let us find out how San Francisco reduced traffic with Smart Parking.
San Francisco: Top Contestant for Traffic Congestions
Though San Francisco did not score the worst in terms of traffic congestion, the city was notorious as one of the top contestants for traffic issues. And the leading cause for such woes was cruising – motorists circling the streets in search of a vacant parking spot. Some drivers spent an excessive amount of time cruising behind the wheel. All their hope rested on chance – the area where they’re headed and whether or not it is the rush hour.
For instance – Areas such as the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge were choke points and as such, remained overcrowded for most part of the day. However, the worse congestion time was the morning hours, precisely around 8:00 AM. On average, Thursdays scored worse than any other day of the week.
Moreover, the gridlock, mainly during peak hours, branched from the root of the issue – finding an available parking spot. The busy downtown and Chinatown were inconveniently crowded to the extent that drivers were compelled to opt for metered or garage parking as finding a street parking spot was like spotting a unicorn. So, how San Francisco reduced traffic with Smart Parking?
Smart Parking: Making Life Easier for Drivers
Now, finding a vacant parking spot in San Francisco may be a real adventure, but that’s not the kind of adventure most of us like to embark on. With the emergence, trial-and-error efforts, and official usage of smart parking technology, the city’s drivers are experiencing a much-needed respite from their daily traffic struggles.
By displaying available parking spots via smart applications and guiding a driver to the exact location of the desired spot, the smart parking system – SF Park – has not only dealt with the city’s motorists’ worst nightmare but has also streamlined the traffic flow. Vehicle miles have definitely decreased as drivers can spot an available parking spot with ease. Also, local sales tax revenue has increased, indicating that people spent lesser time cruising around and more on their businesses.
Having said that, it is also true that the exact impact of the city’s SF Park system cannot be quantified as of now. This does not mean bad news. It merely means that there is room for improvement – the system’s efficiency and performance is as realistic as it can get. By and by, as advancements in smart parking technology take place (and they are taking place), the system will naturally become smarter and more efficient.
Does the Future Look Even Brighter?
As of now, the one area that especially needs improvement is the availability of a guaranteed parking space every single time. So, what can drivers do until the issue is dealt with? The best approach would be to reserve a monthly parking SF. These credentials allow drivers to enter and exit the facility freely without worrying about the availability of a parking space. This feature is especially useful for those working downtown or visiting downtown on a regular basis.
Moving on to the future; San Francisco’s SF Park is bound to get better as constant improvements are being made to IoT or the Internet of Things – the technology behind Smart Parking. Once the problem of guaranteed availability has been solved, motorists will already know the total number of available parking spots even before they enter the lot. This will be displayed via smart apps. At that ideal time, neither will there be any traffic congestions, nor loss of fuel and money and no unwanted carbon emissions into the environment.
Place the word “smart” in front of any noun, and you can instantly have something that somehow sounds improved. However, smart parking’s current achievements do not cancel the fact that there is a learning curve and a long way to go before the vision of a cruise-free San Francisco can be realized. However, when that happens, all worries and fears with regards to missing commitments or arriving late for a corporate meeting will become a distant memory.

Implement a driver coaching systemThe data gathered from telematics systems illustrates certain modifications that could improve driver behavior. Implementing these modifications will result in a reduction of losses and increased safety on the roads.
A driver coaching program is both a written and verbal safety policy that clearly states driver expectations and performance. Encourage consistent communication with employees and establish a system for employees to provide feedback, address concerns or get their questions answered in a swift and easy manner.
Master the system you’re usingThe best way to get the most out of your telematics system is to take the time to learn it.
You may uncover beneficial use-cases for your particular industry that you may not have without knowing the full capabilities. Lean on your telematics provider’s training resources.
They should have an extensive learning/help center and provide role-based training sessions and courses so that your drivers and admins only need to learn what matters to their day-to-day use of the platform.
These courses can be offered live online or recorded for on-demand use. Take the time to learn your telematics program and about the various metrics you can measure and leverage.
Clearly define and communicate the key metrics that you want to trackPay attention to details but avoid obsessing over each tiny data point.
Telematics can provide fleet managers with a great deal of data, so it’s imperative to have goals and an overall operational plan. This could include benchmarks in driver productivity and efficiency, safety, fleet maintenance and any other business-related goals.
By spotlighting data that makes sense for your relevant objectives, it will allow you to adjust and make decisions that move the needle in a meaningful way for your set criteria.
Further to this point, be intentional with your internal communication plan and be transparent in sharing with employees which key performance indicators will be measured when they are hired. Have managers and team leads set clear expectations upfront regarding productivity and safety.
Fleet managers can garner driver buy-in for safety coaching programs and performance feedback reviews by consistently communicating with employees and establishing an efficient and easy system for employees to provide feedback, address concerns and have questions answered.
Another communication approach would be to start small and only focus on the most impactful metrics at first. Initially tracking only important data points— such as idling rates, delivery times and basic driving behaviors — can prevent drivers from feeling overwhelmed and heavily monitored when adopting a new telematics system, and fleet managers can always expand upon the initial list of tracked metrics as time goes on.
DON’T
Rely on telematics as the only way to evaluate employees and identify bad driversYes, it is important to carefully analyze the collected data, but do not use this as the sole form of driver evaluation. This could lead to distrust between managers and employees.
There may have been extenuating circumstances, such as traffic delays or road accidents, that caused a reduction in driver efficiency, so make sure to review the entire situation before labeling someone as a bad driver.
As discussed in the “dos,” a holistic approach to employee evaluation is rooted in open communication. By having conversations with customers, coworkers and – most importantly – the driver in question, you will gain a more accurate representation of an employee’s performance.
Be hard on employees when adopting your telematics softwareIt is natural for employees to be resistant or feel overwhelmed when a company implements new technologies.
Do not expect employees to embrace the system immediately. Give them time to feel it out, which will in time improve their overall performance. You also do not want to hide any information from employees. Instead, implement a user-friendly system and capitalize on transparency with employees. Hiding important information or eluding arduous questions will not lead to desired driver results.
Wait for the end of month/week reporting to take corrective actionsTraditional driver safety coaching programs are based on reports that are captured and produced on a weekly/monthly basis.
This useful information can be used in a reactive manner, but newer systems can offer feedback in real-time that is customized to your requirements. By setting up custom alerts in your telematics system, you can be notified in real-time when issues arise and take action before the problem persists long enough to be increasingly harmful to your bottom line.
Telematics has a lot to offer fleet managers and following best practices will help get the most out of the systems.
From driver coaching and safety programs to productivity tracking to business benchmarks, telematics can provide insights into almost every area of fleet management. Smart data management and application will help fleet managers maximize the functionality of their systems.
By following the dos and avoiding the don’ts, telematics will drive fleet managers to success.

The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) has seen a significant spike in transit ridership in recent months, and even more so in recent weeks as gas prices continue to ride. 
“MTS was budgeting for an 11 percent increase in ridership over last fiscal year. Our new estimates show ridership will jump 45 percent over the previous year,” said Sharon Cooney, MTS CEO. “We still have room to grow to get back to pre-pandemic levels, but these are great indicators. This sustained growth coupled with recent ridership spikes prove that people are motivated to save money, and still know that transit is a safe and affordable way to get around.” 
MTS has developed a dedicated webpage with a commute calculator for those interested in learning about the cost of driving alone vs. taking transit. The calculator factors in information such as commuting miles, estimated miles per gallon, parking costs, number of days commuting and price per gallon of fuel. The agency has also launched digital advertisements to educate commuters about the costs of driving vs. taking transit.  
Preliminary ridership estimates from last week show: 
Ridership was up to nearly 200,000 trips per weekday (197,000) for the week of March 7-11, which is approximately 70 percent of the pre-COVID-19 baseline.  This is the highest ridership has been since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trolley ridership has grown to more than 80 percent of pre-pandemic level. On Wednesday, March 9, ridership jumped 102 percent systemwide vs. the same day in 2021 There was a 111 percent ridership increase on trolleys. There was a 94 percent ridership increase on buses. 
Additionally, year-over-year comparison by month shows that ridership has consistently been significantly higher compared to last year. Even during the height of the Omicron surge in January, MTS transit ridership showed consistent improvement over 2021. In February, MTS hit its highest monthly increase in ridership over the same month last year. 
Another positive development for transit is that the UC San Diego Blue Line is performing well since the 11-mile extension to UTC opened in November 2021. The Blue Line is now averaging nearly 60,000 trips per weekday since the start of February. This is approximately a 33 percent ridership increase since the extension opened on Nov. 21.

It’s estimated that about 50 percent of car trips in urban areas are three miles or less in length, making them a possible candidate for replacement with other modes. 
By Skip Descant
It stands to reason that moving more car trips in urban areas to micromobility modes will reduce congestion. New research quantifies this reduction, offering another tool for policymakers and infrastructure planners.
A study from Carnegie Mellon University zeroes in on how micromobility — namely e-bikes — can affect congestion in Seattle, finding that if even 10 percent of short car trips during peak afternoon travel were replaced with micromobility, more than 4,800 car trips would not happen, decreasing vehicle miles traveled by more than 7,300 miles a day, a 2.76 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
“The big takeaways are that micromobility could decrease congestion, especially on highly congested corridors. But you’re going to need wide-scale bike lane deployment,” said Corey Harper, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and one of the authors of the study.
It’s estimated that about 50 percent of car trips in urban areas are three miles or less in length, making them a possible candidate for replacement with other modes.
Americans are not huge cyclists. Only about 1 percent of trips in the United States are taken by biking, according to the 2017 National Household Travel Survey. But one of the many side effects of the COVID-19 pandemic was an increase in cycling in a number of metro areas. And micromobility advocates have been bullish about the growth potential for this transportation sector.
Speaking at the Micromobility World Conference last month, Travis VanderZanden, founder and CEO of Bird, said his company’s aim has always been to serve short trips.
“So far, it seems like we’ve been able to have a pretty good impact on some of these short-range trips. But there’s still a lot of work to be done,” said VanderZanden.
VanderZanden also stressed the need for more micromobility infrastructure to better serve these new forms of transportation.
“We need to continue to solve this chicken and egg problem for cities by showing them, hey, people are willing to get out of cars now. Let’s make sure the infrastructure follows suit. And that’s bike lanes. But it’s also more dedicated parking for micromobility as well,” said VanderZanden.
“Right now,” said Harper, “if you replaced a lot of short car trips with bikes, then these bike trips are going to interfere with private vehicles, because there’s not a lot of bike lanes.”
In Seattle, it’s estimated that 18 percent of short car trips could be replaced with micromobility, and during peak travel times, some 70 percent of trips in the Puget Sound region are made by private vehicles, according to the study.
The research could be used by metropolitan planning agencies, cycling advocates, transportation planners and others, said Harper.
“This quantifies the impacts more bike lanes could have in terms of energy use and getting more people out of cars and onto bikes,” he added.
It will take more than pedal power to solve the world’s climate crisis, say researchers, who note replacing a lot of short urban trips with micromobility would likely do more to improve congestion than to reduce energy usage. The reason is simple: Longer trips, made by cars and other vehicles, still account for the bulk of emissions associated with the transportation sector.
“So we’re going to do a whole lot more than just replace short trips with micromobility. We’re going to have to electrify vehicles, buses, trucks. We have to target longer trips with commuter trains, commuter buses, in order for cities to meet those climate change targets that the White House set out,” said Harper. “We’re going to have to do a lot more than just say, ‘Alright, everybody get on a bike.'”

The connected e-bike sharing solution adopted by the cities of Copenaghen, Rotterdam and  Stockholm, along with some of the major cities of the UK, exhibits in Paris the latest  solutions for urban mobility.  

VAIMOO, the Made in Italy connected e-bike sharing designed by Angel Company, which  develops high-tecnological solutions for railways, digital mechatronics and aerospace, returns  to Autonomy Paris, the major international exhibit dedicated to sustainable mobility which  takes place in Paris on March 16-17, 2022.  
During these two days, VAIMOO (Booth F-11) is going to present its e-bike sharing solutions  both docked (station-based) and hybrid (virtual stations). The solutions consist of electric  bikes and a management software with the latest updates in order to efficiently respond to  the growing necessities of urban mobility.  
Autonomy Paris is also going to be an opportunity to dialogue with the major players of the  industry, which will discuss about the current evolutions along with present and future  mobility trends.  
On March 16, VAIMOO will be one of the on-stage protagonists of the panel “e-Bike Sharing:  a resource for Public Transports” during which European transport operators such as  Deutsche Bahn and Jelbi will share their experiences with e-bike sharing services integrated  with public transport, in order to find common guidelines and best practice to face this  challenge.  On March 17, Matteo Pertosa – CEO & Founder of VAIMOO – will close the second and last  day with the speech ‘e-Bikes: a solution for Urban Transport & Logistics’ in occasion of which  will share his vision about the spreading of e-bikes, talking about how delivery companies and  sharing platforms can benefit from this evolution, keeping an eye on the future.

 Mobility as a Service (MaaS) remains a trending term for media  platforms and app developers to use. However, David Hensher, Chinh Ho  and John Nelson suggest the term should be used more appropriately to  describe a fully integrated and sustainable system, rather than just an  enhanced travel planning app.                                                                                                              
Almost without exception, many media platforms post a growing amount of news items under the heading of Mobility as a Service or MaaS.  LinkedIn, for example, is replete with such material (including webinars) promoted in the name of MaaS. But how much of this news is really about MaaS? We had previously tried to clarify what MaaS is and  what MaaS is not with a benchmark definition, but it still seems as if the app developers (or more accurately the travel planner folks) and  many transport operators, continue to promote their new tools as MaaS. 
A  most recent one (there are too many to mention) is Scottish MaaS trial goes live (launched on 21 June). It is not MaaS. It is a multi-modal journey planner. The promo video  states that it is “travel made simple” and a ‘travel companion’. While  this is a nice idea and potentially represents a step-forward in terms  of meeting traveller needs with an integrated ticketing and payment  function, overly promoting such an app as MaaS suggests that many MaaS  promoters on social media don’t get, or refuse to get, what constitutes  MaaS and the four levels of MaaS integration.
To clarify what MaaS is, and is not, ITLS researchers, together with 
MaaS pioneers and advocators, have put forward a benchmark definition as
 follows[1]:
‘MaaS is a framework for delivering a portfolio of multi-modal 
mobility services that places the user at the centre of the offer. MaaS 
frameworks are ideally designed to achieve sustainable policy goals and 
objectives. MaaS is an integrated transport service brokered by an 
integrator through a digital platform. A digital platform provides 
information, booking, ticketing, payment (as PAYG and/or subscription 
plans), and feedback that improves the travel experience. The MaaS 
framework can operate at any spatial scale(i.e., urban or 
regional or global) and cover any combination of multi-modal and 
non-transport-related multi-service offerings, including the private car
 and parking, whether subsidised or not by the public sector. MaaS is 
not simply a digital version of a travel planner, nor a flexible 
transport service (such as Mobility on Demand), nor a single shared 
transport offering (such as car sharing). ‘Emerging MaaS’ best describes
 MaaS offered on a niche foundation. This relates to situations where 
MaaS is offered on a limited spatial scale, to a limited segment of 
society or focused on limited modes of transport. The MaaS framework 
becomes mainstream when the usage by travellers dominates a spatial 
scale and the framework encompasses a majority of the modes of 
transport. All the other variants that do not meet our definition might 
be referred to as ‘Aspiring MaaS’ given the normal usage of ‘aspiring’ 
having ‘hope’ or ‘ambitions’. (Hensher et al. 2021)
Let us try and simplify this position in a way that may be more 
persuasive in ensuring that MaaS is properly ascribed to, since if we 
continue to promote any mobility idea as MaaS, particularly the growth 
industry of travel planning apps, then the real fear is that we enter 
into a downward spiral of time wasted on debate and effort that amounts 
to nothing more than confusion, frustration and lack of progress on what
 can really make a difference to delivering sustainable (and 
commercially attractive) solutions and improved traveller satisfaction.
Critically, MaaS needs to show value in both sustainability and profitability  to have buy-in from both government/society and business. Without these  two critical value propositions, and buy-in from critical stakeholders  in the MaaS eco-system, MaaS will likely develop as a niche service, and  techno/app developers can (and will) lead the debates which may not  deliver real long term value for society. How exactly we achieve buy-in  from both business and government is yet unknown, but the evidence we  have amassed so far suggests that it is difficult and requires a lot of  collaboration and trust between stakeholders, which is far from assured. 
 Unless MaaS brokers/aggregators can negotiate with transportation  network companies (TNCs), and government, to use a cross-subsidy  strategy to fund MaaS services that deliver both socially acceptable  sustainability and commercial goals, MaaS is unlikely to ever be  profitable or societally sustainable. In most markets in general, any  unprofitable products and services would likely receive no significant  investment from businesses to obtain scalability unless there is a high  level of confidence in turning the corner in the (foreseeable) future.  MaaS is no different. Without the possibility of scalability, MaaS  becomes ‘another’ initiative in the government’s list of initiatives to  prioritise. The path to scalability currently seems to suffer from a  dominant focus on the next enhanced digital platform and very little  else.
So what is the value proposition likely to be that we should support?  If it is agreed that MaaS is unlikely to be commercial and thus is only  of value if it delivers on sustainability goals, then it is doubtful it  will go beyond what we can achieve already through the existing ways of  delivering transport.
 This is the big question. How can MaaS really  make a difference? It may be that an App developer offering better and  timely information remains relevant and convenient for some, but we ask  the promoters to stop calling this MaaS since it only improves travel  information, although this improvement is still valuable (and the  addition of other contextual / points of interest information is also  useful). But does it change travel behaviour enough to claim an impact  on sustainable goals? Collective evidence, we have to date, suggests  that a MaaS app will not change travel behaviour to deliver  sustainability outcomes, but a fully integrated MaaS system can in time  (Ho et al. 2021). Without the need to show complicated modelling  evidence, this early finding is easy to comprehend.
It remains a challenge to get key players in the intelligent mobility  space to recognise that offering a mixture of modes with the exact same levels of services such as travel times, reliability, and frequency  (which are the real drivers of traveller behavior) already offered outside of a MaaS eco-system, with PAYG financial discounts associated with some journey planning Apps, can hardly be claimed as added-value for travellers. This is why we would prefer if the great majority of App developers and transport suppliers and their advisers start talking about ‘Enhanced Travel Information Service’ or ETIS and not MaaS!

Living with the pressure of delivering reliable, on-demand transportation to riders in a 700-square-mile service area with just two vehicles may seem like a tall order, but for the past year it’s simply been business as usual for the operations team at Battle Creek Transit.
In March of 2021, Battle Creek Transit received funding through a Michigan Department of Transportation grant to launch the Calhoun County Coordinated Mobility Pilot – or as it came to be known to residents in the community: BCGo.
Today, BCGo provides door-to-door microtransit service across all of Calhoun County, including in the cities of Battle Creek, Marshall and Albion. As they approach the service’s one-year anniversary, it’s fair to say that not only has BCGo demonstrated the feasibility of an on-demand microtransit service in the county, but it’s also made an important impact on the community members that regularly use the service.
‘The demand far exceeded anyone’s expectations’
Residents of Calhoun County who don’t own or have regular access to a vehicle have faced a rough road in the past couple of years when it comes to finding reliable mobility options that meet their daily needs. Straightforward tasks such as commuting to a job interview, meeting up with friends or simply trying to get to the grocery store suddenly become much more stressful when faced with limited transportation options.
“We have always known that there was demand for this kind of service, especially in the rural areas of the county, but BCGo has allowed us to prove that the demand far exceeded what anyone’s expectations were and has provided us the opportunity to engage with the community like never before,” said Mallory Avis, public transit director, city of Battle Creek.
In March of 2020, one year prior to BCGo’s launch, a Calhoun County Transit Survey uncovered that these types of challenges were an everyday reality for many citizens of Calhoun County. The study painted a picture of a community in critical need of alternative mobility options. It found that Calhoun County was home to more senior citizens and people living with disabilities than the national average. At the same time, a higher-than-average percentage of the county’s population was living under 150 percent of the poverty line and a lower-than-average percentage of households had regular access to more than one car.
To make matters worse, in September of 2019 a reliable private cab company that had operated for decades in Battle Creek, the largest city in the county, had to close its doors for good.
All told, the Calhoun County Transit Survey estimated that the county faced an annual shortfall of more than 20,000 available trips relative to demand. One year later, the BCGo service hit the road for the first time to help residents of Calhoun County safely and reliably navigate through their community.
Building the platform
To help power the new microtransit service, the team at Battle Creek Transit turned to shared mobility provider Liftango to build the Demand-Responsive Transit platform that would allow users to book trips straight from their phones using the BCGo App (iOS and Android.)
This technology platform dynamically routes BCGo’s two vehicles throughout the service area based on real-time passenger demand so that they can maximize ridership and minimize wasted miles. Passengers that want to book their trip in advance get a truly guaranteed, pre-booked ride thanks to Liftango’s advanced matching algorithm.
“The experts will tell you that a county-wide microtransit service supported by a small fleet of vehicles will fail. The combination of Battle Creek Transit’s understanding of their community and Liftango’s unique matching approach has enabled a service that is efficient and hugely valued by the community. BCGo stands out as a true illustration of the power of demand responsive transport; something counties across the U.S. could look to replicate,” said Liftango Vice President Americas Jacob Greig.
BCGo customers can book rides up to 14 days in advance and as close to 30 minutes prior to the desired departure time. To deliver guaranteed, pre-booked rides, the BCGo app provides riders with different matching options that account for other requests already placed in the system, vehicle availability, the user’s schedule and a host of other variables. This allows commuters to access truly on-demand transport around their schedule without worrying that the ride they were depending on may not be matched in the system.
Riders without access to a smartphone or mobile device can call Battle Creek Transit Dispatch where the operations center enters their desired pick-up and drop-off times and uses the same booking system to find them the best available ride.
Measuring the impact
Since the launch of the BCGo pilot on March 8, 2021, the response and demand in the community has been overwhelming. In fact, the service’s only limitation appears to be that they simply do not have enough vehicles or staff members to keep up with the county’s demand for their service.
In the second month of operation, the service’s two vehicles were already completing dozens of trips every day. From its launch in March of 2021 through the end of the year, the service booked nearly 7,000 trips and averaged a daily ridership of close to 30 passengers.
Retention rates have also been remarkably high for the entire duration of the pilot phase. For example, from June of 2021, BCGo’s third full month of operation, through the end of December, reporting data shows that an average of 68 percent of riders each month were returning users. Many riders have come to depend on BCGo as a primary mode of transportation and this level of loyalty can be attributed in part to the fact that the service is reliable, punctual and affordable. The service is early or on time with 82 percent of pickups and 85 percent of drop-offs and ride fares are calculated dynamically based on trip mileage.
The service is also accessible to riders with special mobility assistance needs, including passengers in wheelchairs, those with portable oxygen tanks or other medical devices. The BCGo mobile application allows mobility-assisted riders to alert their driver ahead of time and automatically accounts for space requirements when completing passenger bookings. BCGo vehicles completed, on average, more than 25 mobility-assisted trips each month from March of 2021 through the end of December.
‘Expanding access to education, employment, healthcare and social activities’
Regular BCGo riders have been enthusiastic about sharing their support of the program and the impact it’s had on their lives. Community members regularly use BCGo to see friends and family members that they had been separated from for months, or even years, due to lack of reliable transportation options.
Here is what two users had to say about their experience with the BCGo service:
“I want to tell you how impressed I am with BCGo, I give your service five stars. All your drivers and dispatchers are so friendly and personable. I’m thrilled with this new service. Keep up the good work.”
“Used this service for my mother for the first time today. I have nothing but positive things to say. Prompt service plus very nice and polite employees. Affordable service. This service helped get my mom out and about after a year and a half. So thankful.”
BCGo has proved to be a successful example of how technology can completely change the way public transportation operates. The Coordinated Mobility Pilot has allowed Battle Creek Transit to demonstrate the feasibility of on-demand transportation in rural and suburban areas with a lower population density than most other service zones.
“BCGo has allowed us to better meet the needs of Calhoun County, expanding access to education, employment, healthcare, and social activities. Getting to know our customers and their stories plays a key role in the success of our pilot and the transportation services we aim to provide in the future,” said Battle Creek Transit Mobility Manager Kristy Grestini.
BCGo has changed the perception of and increased the adoption of public transportation for Calhoun County. The combination of vehicle design, technology and customer service has elevated the expectations of public transit and has allowed Battle Creek Transit and other area providers to use this energy and the data collected to advance conversations regarding transit funding and service expansions.

New Zealand’s micromobility sector
 is about blow up, with revenue expected to grow from $9.5 million in 
2020 to $2.4 billion by 2030. Paired with growth in EV adoption, a 
general desire to reduce carbon emissions, and navigating a post-Covid 
world, micromobility is increasingly looking like the future of 
transport.

 ‘Micromobility’ refers to small, lightweight vehicles that typically 
operate below the 25-30kmh mark, either as rentals or privately owned. 
Think Lime scooters or Onzo bikes, as well as the various e-bikes and 
e-scooters you can buy off the shelf.
  They are often used as ‘first mile/lastmile’ solutions in tandem with  public transport (for example to or from the home or office from the  train or bus station) or even a private car (to and from a car park).Current Time 0:00/Duration 0:30 WARWICK SMITH/STUFFPalmerston  North welcomes the arrival of e-scooters with mayor Grant Smith test  riding scooters of each of the three companies represented.
 Stuff spoke to Katherine Sandford, CEO of UBCO,
 about the micromobility industry in New Zealand, who said that 
micromobility has been largely driven by electric transportation, in 
particular the rise of the e-scooter.
 According to PS Market Research,
 the e-scooter has taken off due to the “additional comfort they offer 
over pedal-assisted bikes.” They also allow people to move faster and 
more conveniently, trading e-bikes and cars for public transport and 
e-scooters.
 Additionally, micromobility is a low-cost option, which appeals to a lot of New Zealanders.

 “With micromobility, users need not take the hassle of buying a vehicle
 and bearing vehicle maintenance, insurance, charging/refuelling, 
parking, and other expenses. The option of a low-cost commute thus 
motivates consumers to replace their walking phase with a suitable 
two-wheeler for first- and last-mile connectivity.”
 Sandford added that micromobility could also increase patronage in public transport by up to nine per cent by 2030, citing an NZTA study from 2021.

 “Cars and particularly electric cars will continue to be a valuable 
part of the total transport system, especially while public transport 
options are limited. What you use depends on the situation – whether 
you’re carrying a load of stuff, going between meetings or taking the 
kids to school. So we’ll need to make sure there are a range of 
sustainable options, as well as a high consideration of convenience.

 “People generally want to do the right thing, but if it requires too 
much effort or change in routine, then they’re far less likely to adopt a
 new approach.”

 Rising numbers startups in the sector show the current demand and 
potential for growth, mainly aiming to satisfy ‘last-mile’ connectivity.
 These include Lime, Neuron Mobility, Onzo and Beam Mobility.
  These are generally ‘dockless’ systems, which don’t require recharging  at a dedicated station when not in use, and can be both bikes and  scooters. They can be left anywhere and are usually unlocked via a  mobile application. While convenient, it means that dockless bikes  easily clutter up the streets, or even be dumped in a harbour… 
  If you’re considering investing or even starting your own micromobility  company, Sandford recommends being “obsessed” with solving your end-user’s problem.

 “New Zealanders have a real knack for getting to the heart of tricky 
problems by understanding what makes people tick and ticked off. Fail 
fast – test, rework and test again until you find users who will 
consistently pay for your product – then you know you have product 
market-fit and are ready to scale.”
 Dockless systems are generally preferred because they are cheaper to deploy, operate, and maintain.
 Ubco is operating in both private and commercial fields,
 selling bikes direct to customers online as well as trialling a 
business model where it supplies a vehicle, manages all servicing and 
maintenance, and ensures up-time to an agreed service level, in return 
for a monthly fee.
  “Ultimately this type of model will be rolled out to consumers, but in  the meantime, we’re making it easy for them to order online, unpack and  configure the product at home, and then simply register the vehicle for  on-road usage through VTNZ.”

This is the era of drones, and these unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, increasingly are becoming an integral part of everyday life.
As drones evolve, industries and governments alike are finding new ways to make use of this emerging technology. TechNewsWorld spoke with several experts to find out how drones are being put into service, and what’s on the horizon for their future use.
One theme in all of their perspectives is that ultimately, drones aren’t simply flying machines; they’re also data gatherers and processors.
“At the end of the day, our drone industry’s product is data, not aircraft,” Reese Mozer, co-founder and CEO of American Robotics, explained to TechNewsWorld. “With true automation comes the ability to collect a new category of data not previously possible, and as a result a new category of valuable analytics and insights.”
Drones range in size from that of a large aircraft to those that fit in the palm of your hand. The services they can perform are of equal variety.
“Drones are aerial robots,” Richard Schwartz, president and CEO of Pensa Systems, told TechNewsWorld. “They are lightweight, agile, a hundred times cheaper than bulky ground-based robots, and able to ‘hop over’ — no pun intended — obstacles and changes in physical locations.
“Because of this, they have the potential to be a scalable industry and multisector solution, using autonomous perception — that is, where the computer is seeing and translates what it sees into actionable impact — to further automate tasks that are either tedious or difficult for people.”
Building Drones
One innovation in the drone world has been the development of new methods of building drones themselves, including in-home workshops or other small workstations in Aquiline Drones’ Agile Manufacturing Pod (AMP) model.
“AMP is a portable, high-tech workstation that can be installed in homes, businesses, battlefields, and other settings to address the growing demand for drone services in the country,” Barry Alexander, founder and CEO of Aquiline Drones, explained to TechNewsWorld.
“It is essentially a proprietary modular manufacturing process that transforms any 12-foot by 12-foot area into a mini manufactory center in less than one day.”
This mobile manufacturing system is changing not just the way drones are made, but the way people work, as well.
“All AMP operators receive detailed instructions and guidance through the AD Cloud, an AI system that streamlines inventory, quality control and shipping,” said Alexander. “Operators can then produce as many drones as they desire, knowing that it takes approximately eight hours to produce one drone.
“Once constructed, Aquiline Drones will then purchase AMP-produced drones directly from the operator, paying between $200 to $800 above the cost of production, depending on the particular drone model.”
Emergency Response
A variety of industries and businesses are finding ways to use the unique powers of drones, especially given their capacities to gather and process data. One of the major benefits of drones in a variety of business situations is that they are, simply, safer than using people.
“On the safety front, drones reduce the requirement to utilize helicopters and human beings from climbing on vertical structures to conduct inspections,” Dave Culler, senior vice president of strategic partnerships for PrecisionHawk, told TechNewsWorld.
“Also, once a critical issue is identified from a drone, the repair is very focused, minimizing the time requirement of someone being on the structure. The quality will only improve, and AI models will ensure the critical issues are discovered in minimal time.
“Drones are very environmentally-friendly, especially compared to a helicopter flying and carrying thousands of pounds of jet fuel,” explained Culler.
Because of their unique capabilities, drones have become a vital part of the work of first responders, providing information about disasters, crimes, and other events before any person is on the scene.
“Drones provide effective disaster and medical response, including the delivery of emergency supplies and equipment to victims in areas that are not safe to travel to by others,” said Alexander.
“They can be deployed ahead of police to provide first-person viewpoints of crimes in action, including live footage of the scene and images of criminals. In a ‘smart city’ initiative, AI-driven sensors designed to pick up abnormal sounds associated with crimes and danger can be positioned in key locations across a region to give police advance warnings thus, keeping them safer on the job.
“When seconds count in an emergency event, drones can be organized ahead of first responders, fire departments and EMTs to access the situation, provide a critical analysis of the scene, and deliver lifesaving supplies to victims that are not readily accessible by a human person in time.”

Deliveries, too, are being transformed by drone technology — a trend that’s likely to increase.
“Drones can perfectly complement other means of transportation, especially in rural or hard-to-reach areas,” Thomas Dreiling, a spokesperson for Wingcopter, explained to TechNewsWorld.
“In many cases, they can deliver goods on-demand, much faster, more efficiently and, in the case of electrically-powered drones such as the Wingcopter, more environmentally-friendly than trucks, vans, or helicopters.”
Autonomously Into the Future
Drone technology is evolving quickly. As they become more sophisticated, drones are expected to become a more prominent part of everyday life in the not-so-distant future.
“Drones will play an ever-growing role in our lives, be it for deliveries, for mapping/surveying or inspection purposes, or for precision agriculture,” explained Dreiling.
“Use cases with a clearly positive societal impact such as drone-based medical delivery networks that improve access to healthcare in rural, underserved communities will increase the public’s acceptance and lead the way for other applications.”
As they become more autonomous, drones will become more integrated into all facets of human life and activities.
“We’re only a few years off from having most drones flying autonomously, long distances and inspecting, delivering pizzas and providing medical supplies in minimal time,” predicted Culler.
“The U.S. military today can fly and monitor drones across the globe. The same will be true for commercial drone applications. Inspections can and will happen from distance locations.
“Drones will also autonomously integrate with other robotic capabilities, ensuring air and ground capture complete the full end-to-end inspection solution. Automation, machine learning, and AI will advance the quality of inspections and data, ensuring insight to action is at the speed of light.”

In smart city projects,
 IoT is a key enabler, and a number of other technologies and 
applications must be used to make smart city projects a reality. Smart 
cities are becoming increasingly popular. However, there is much more to
 smart cities development than just putting together a website and 
hoping it will take off. The ability to respond in an instant is an 
important factor that has led to a shift in city formation. To develop 
smart city technology, cities must have access to information on 
sustainability, resilience, and artificial intelligence to successfully 
analyze data and improve city life.
Besides, sustainable smart 
cities also help improve infrastructure. These systems can monitor air 
quality and waste management, which is already proven in the examples of
 such cities as Singapore, Zurich, and Oslo.To
 develop smart city technology, cities must have access to information 
on sustainability, resilience, and artificial intelligence to 
successfully analyze data and improve city life.Click To Tweet
What is a Smart City?
A smart city is a technologically advanced urban area.
 Generally, it is a digitalized version of a physical city. It is one of
 the newest forms of technology as it uses different kinds of electronic
 methods to collect data. It integrates all the different layers of a 
city’s infrastructure.
This includes sensors to detect people 
walking by the street, sensors to detect when it is dark outside our 
other sensors that might be necessary for effective technological 
performance around the city. For example, a light-detecting sensor 
enables a city to turn on the streetlights automatically when necessary.
 This technology is used by governments to make decisions regarding 
transportation and climate.
The concept of a smart city involves 
bringing together a number of fields of knowledge. It includes public 
administration and e-government. The latest developments in this field 
have made it possible for cities to create and deploy their own 
intelligent systems. Developing a sustainable smart city is an important
 part of a city’s development, so the concept of a sustainable smart 
city must be embraced.
IoT Solutions Role in Smart Cities Development
Internet
 of Things (IoT) solutions have played a key role in the development of 
sustainable smart cities. They help in reducing power consumption and 
costs, as well as play a significant role in preventing crime. They can 
be deployed in public places to provide real-time monitoring, analytics,
 and decision-making tools. This can also be used to track and predict 
crime scenes.
The IoT network allows cities to track and improve 
the safety of public transportation. The use of IoT sensors in public 
transport systems can provide a wealth of data about the journey of a 
passenger. With this information, smart public transportation operators 
can improve the traveling experience.
There are many advantages of
 using IoT in a smart infrastructure. For example, it can provide 
enhanced security and convenience. It can also be used to improve 
efficiency in data collection and management. The IoT in a city is the 
way to increase the quality of the urban lifestyle.
How do IoT Technologies Build Smart Cities?
IoT
 smart city solutions can be widely used in city infrastructure. For 
instance, smart fire sensors can alert citizens of fire and coordinate 
rescue robots, which will significantly improve the safety of city 
residents. Other IoT applications are also eco-friendly and 
power-efficient.
They can also monitor speed limits and other 
factors that affect the quality of life. And because IoT solutions use 
advanced sensors, they can also help develop sustainable commerce 
models. This makes it easier for cities to build smarter infrastructure 
and services.
Best Smart Cities Using IoT Devices
Currently,
 there are more and more sustainable smart cities emerging in the world.
 They focus on the optimization of air quality monitoring, renewable 
energy, green energy systems, optimization of traffic flow, waste 
management companies, and other sustainable smart solutions in urban 
areas. Cities can realize a lot of innovative infrastructure ideas using
 IoT, that is why IoT technologies are of great importance.
Singapore
In
 recent years, Singapore has sought to become one of the world’s first 
official sustainable smart cities to harness the power of the Internet 
of Things. With one of the oldest populations in Asia, Singapore is 
addressing senior living conditions in order to reduce the risk of 
accidents.
Increasing the number of autonomous cars on the road 
has reduced accidents and loneliness among senior citizens. The 
government has also installed surveillance cameras and widened sidewalks
 in certain areas. With these innovations, the government is taking the 
lead in making Singapore a smart city.
Singapore has many aspects 
that help make it a smarter place. Its people are more connected than 
ever, and the government is using digital technologies to promote a 
smart life. Using digital technology to improve public safety is a key 
element of this approach. A smart city enables citizens to access 
information from anywhere. Such highly advanced communication 
technologies facilitate the city’s digital infrastructure development 
and put Singapore in one line with the best IoT smart cities.
Singapore
 has a rapidly growing technology ecosystem. The land transport 
authority has recently expanded its autonomous vehicle pilot zones and 
is working to integrate active mobility with public transportation. By 
integrating a smart city with the existing transport system, people can 
live in an environment that is able to handle any situation that may 
arise. City officials want to make the city a “citizen-centric” one.
Additionally,
 Singapore’s government is highly concerned with the environmental 
situation and has already taken a lot of initiatives that push Singapore
 to the list of the world’s smartest cities. For example, Singapore has 
implemented a smart waste bin system. It is aimed at improving air 
quality and fitting the United Nations regulations on environmental 
policy.
What is more, Singapore has big plans for the future 
integration of smart city technologies. Some of the more innovative 
services are already in place. For example, the Singapore Police Force 
has a web-based electronic police center that helps citizens file police
 reports. The system also allows citizens to access information and 
other information they might need online.
Another initiative is 
the Singapore Power mobile app. It allows citizens to see their monthly 
bills and submit meter readings, and it also helps them audit their 
homes’ usage. With the help of IoT, Singapore can become a global 
leader, and with this understanding, the government allocates a lot of 
resources on realizing smart city projects.
Zurich
Zurich,
 being listed as the second smartest city is attempting to become the 
best in the world with a number of initiatives. The innovations team is 
working with the municipal government, SBB, and various electrical 
utilities in the Canton of Zurich. They are collaborating with a wide 
range of companies to make it easier for citizens to participate. With a
 lean approach, they are able to make the entire process transparent, 
which makes it a lot easier to implement.
Zurich takes a lot of 
initiatives focused on decreasing power consumption and optimizing 
digital security. Other initiatives include reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions, circular waste management, and implementing technology-based 
plans to keep the city safe and crime-free. All of these initiatives are
 possible due to the effective use of smart sensors.
Zurich 
supports innovative, responsible, and sustainable development. It seeks 
to improve public transport, increase energy efficiency, and reduce 
pollution. It also offers climate-neutral mobility. Zurich’s initiative 
is aimed at increasing the quality of life in the city.
Additionally,
 Zurich is pursuing innovative projects to overcome its challenges. The 
concept of smart cities is already a big challenge. Not only is it 
difficult to implement but it also requires a thorough understanding of 
people and society. This is why Zurich becomes a role model in the 
concept of Swiss smart cities.
Zurich has invested in fiber-optic 
networks and top-level infrastructure. In addition to this, Zurich’s 
smart streetlights can be a great example to other cities around the 
world. Such a creation of connected devices and networks will make 
Zurich more an attractive place to live in.
Sure thing, Zurich is 
not a pioneer in the smart city movement but it shows a really 
impressive development lastly. Its initiatives include the creation of 
“smart communities” that are part of larger metropolitan areas. Zurich’s
 smart communities will be able to provide the services that people 
need.
It will also allow the city to expand its public mobility in
 a resource-saving way. Zurich is planning to develop a mobility 
platform to serve its citizens and to help them navigate the city. With 
smart communities, Zurich will have safer streets and an easier way for a
 city to manage direct traffic.
Zurich’s transportation, energy, 
and water suppliers are working together to create a sustainable city. 
The city’s municipal government has taken a lead in this movement, with 
the integration of smart traffic lights, smart metering, smart grids, 
and other related projects. They are working with innovative companies 
to develop integrated solutions that not only increase efficiency and 
reduce costs but also promote a better quality of life for residents.

The
 Norwegian capital stands among the best smart cities in the world. It 
realizes a lot of smart city solutions, including solutions for urban 
traffic congestion, smart parking projects, lowering energy usage, and 
other urban planning initiatives. For example, the E-Street project in 
Oslo, Norway, is aimed at making the city’s streets more efficient and 
reducing energy consumption.
Some of these projects focus on 
building new, energy-efficient buildings, retrofitting existing 
buildings, and testing electric buses (school buses, public buses, 
etc.). In fact, the project helps the city to save over 70 percent of 
energy. The project will also introduce new technologies like solar 
panels and will include energy-efficient lamps and smart lighting.
The
 innovative technology that is being used in Oslo’s city plans is not 
limited to energy savings. The connected sensors in these streetlights 
also monitor the humidity and rain levels, enabling the city to optimize
 its waste collection operations. The city’s streets will be connected 
to digital bus stops, which will let citizens know when their bus will 
arrive. The system will also include a parking guide for smart cars.
Another
 initiative, called the Climate Dashboard, aims to help the city make an
 environmentally friendly effort. The climate dashboard will allow 
citizens to follow up on environmental initiatives’ progress. With the 
help of the Climate Dashboard, the city is taking the necessary steps to
 ensure its eco-friendly future.
Another initiative focuses on 
sustainable transportation. The region has a lot of public-private 
collaborations, and Oslo has several such partnerships. The city has a 
lot of potential for improvement. Its innovative programs include smart 
parking, automated streetlights, and bicycle rental points. Furthermore,
 it is planning to introduce a “Smart Oslo Pitch” competition that will 
encourage entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas and help improve the 
quality of life for its citizens.
The city is already working on a
 number of initiatives to make the city more inclusive. The city has 
already implemented six projects and has even made a map of its 
neighborhood. The project’s first phase focuses on making the city 
greener and more sustainable. Its six smart projects, meanwhile, aim to 
increase accessibility for residents and improve accessibility for 
businesses and the local population. These ideas will help make the city
 more accessible to all people.
What Makes Smart Cities Successful?
Organization and Planning
For
 a smart city initiative to be successful it needs to be 
well-thought-out and organized on different levels. The city of the 
future should address the issues of its residents. There are various 
issues to solve: crime, congestion, emergency fire response, waste 
management, active mobility options, police security, absence of 
essential utilities, public transportation, and low-quality housing and 
public administrations.
Given the severe rivalry for talent across
 urban areas, dissatisfied residents are probably going leave for a more
 winning environment. To succeed, city leaders should focus on the 
prosperity, sustainability, and other essential necessities of their 
inhabitants.
Community Involvement
First
 of all, identifying the community responsible for smart city 
development is a vital component of a smart city creation process. This 
will allow smart cities to secure the power of new information and 
technologies. It is important to identify the community’s attributes to 
create a smart city. What is more, it is incredibly important to study 
the social environment for effective smart systems management and 
integration.
Financial Plan
Investment
 management is another essential component of smart infrastructure 
success. The challenges are numerous, and overcoming these obstacles 
will require a systematic approach. In some cases, budget constraints 
may prevent cities from developing smart city initiatives. The city 
needs to invest in a variety of smart technologies, including AI, smart 
city applications, IoT, and smart tools as well as other smart city 
devices.
Established Regulations
In
 order to make a smart city, city officials must implement clear 
policies that improve the quality of life for their residents. To do 
this, smart cities should implement equitable policies that benefit all 
people. Small cities, particularly those in developing countries, must 
also have a public policy that protects the environment since more than 
half of them are facing problems with them.
By implementing 
innovative city services that allow effective data analysis, governments
 will be able to better serve their citizens and use collected data for 
the improvement of entire city life. By developing a sustainable 
strategy, smart cities will create new revenue streams and cut costs.
Conclusion
A
 recent report by the United Nations showed that five out of 10 people 
living in the world will sooner or later live in urban areas. Using 
these technologies, cities can improve energy consumption, energy 
distribution, and overall sustainability. Moreover, cloud-based IoT 
applications can help manage data in real-time and make quicker 
decisions. IoT can help cities automate many processes and provide 
better public safety.
A city can use IoT to monitor the  temperature of its citizens, which is crucial for a healthy and  sustainable environment. These services are the most beneficial solution  to the city environment and the residents. That is why the decision to  integrate IoT technologies into the city infrastructure is the decision  that has to be made for a better quality of life and comfort. Now it’s  time to take a step to the future of smart life.

As logistics and freight organizations become more digitized, enterprises will be able to collect increasing amounts of data surrounding their customers, supply chain, deliveries, fleet, drivers, and more. Leading logistics organizations are already harnessing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in transportation. While a lot of enterprises currently collect this data, which will only continue to increase in the future, this data is still massively underutilized. 
Route Planning with Predictive Analytics
Using the power of AI, enterprises can unlock advanced route planning that optimizes several real-world factors in a way that’s difficult or impossible for traditional route planning to do.
 AI-powered systems will enable better customer experiences, improved fleet management, and better overall business margins in the transportation sector.
Traditional route planning factors in transportation can typically only incorporate a few factors, which are still very naive rule-based factors. However, traditional ways can’t just be replaced overnight. The entire procedure of adapting to a new technology requires time and skills to be acquired.
To enable efficient route planning with AI, enterprises need to account for a wide variety of factors. Factors include the type that is to be delivered, customer preferences, traffic patterns, local road regulations, and changing routing behaviors in addition to subjective factors such as local knowledge of delivery personnel and other preferences.With predictive analytics, an AI-powered system can optimize real-world factors for route planning that results in a lower cost of deliveries, faster delivery times, reduced shipping costs, and better asset utilization. Predictive analytics use data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data. 
Benefits of Utilizing AI For Logistics and Transportation
In the future, AI-based systems will help unlock the true potential power of enterprise data. This will enable better customer experiences, improved fleet management, faster deliveries, lower safety incidents, and better overall business margins. AI enables a win-win scenario for all stakeholders in the logistics transportation ecosystem but requires some effort and investment to build and maintain. 
Recommendations For AI
As important as AI is, an underrated component of AI is data and data engineering. Data engineering is the aspect of data science that focuses on practical applications of data collection and analysis. Before jumping onto the AI hype train, ask yourself, are you collecting critical data about your business operations? Is the data effectively stored, organized, and easily accessible? 
At the end of the day, while AI is currently a trending tech buzzword, it’s only useful to solve an actual business problem. Assess what problems you want AI-based systems to solve, adopt them into your business goals, and use the proper metrics to measure efficiencies.

Creating eco-friendly last-mile delivery strategies is an important business and societal challenge. Here are some options supply chain leaders can explore.
By George Lawton
The recent UN climate report sounded an urgent alarm on global warming. With that, an important source of carbon emissions may receive more scrutiny — the last mile.
The transportation sector is one of the main causes of global carbon emission, and last-mile deliveries are solidly in that category. Greening the last mile is a critical endeavor for today’s supply chain leaders. Most importantly, creating concrete sustainability goals that include a more eco-friendly last mile is an important step in the fight against climate change. But companies with business models that prioritize sustainability can also win with customers. More sustainable last-mile delivery models can also potentially add to the bottom line through greater efficiencies and enhance a company’s brand image.
“Enough customers care about the climate now, so it begins to become a potent aspect of a brand’s identity,” said Peter Dering, CEO at Peak Designs, a camera bag company headquartered in San Francisco that has an environmental focus as its core mission, and co-founder of Climate Neutral.
Here are 10 potential ways companies can opt for more sustainable delivery methods and support a more eco-friendly last mile.
Measure your last-mile carbon footprint
Taking an inventory of your current carbon footprint can help you understand what sustainability goals your company should focus on.
Peak inventoried its footprint and found that sourcing virgin aluminum was its biggest contributor to carbon emissions. However, sourcing recycled aluminum is challenging, particularly for a small companies that use a fraction of what large companies do. So, its leaders decided to invest in stockpiling recycled aluminum far above their requirements. Although stockpiling creates costs to manage, it is cheaper than the corresponding carbon offsets, or the investments that help cancel out carbon emission generation, such as planting trees.
Focus on sustainability metrics
Discovering the pragmatic steps you can take to reduce your carbon footprint is a key aspect of a sustainability initiative. Aspects to focus on include sustainability metrics and carbon offsets, and that may require working with an organization that specializes in these areas.
Climate Neutral, a nonprofit green trade consortium, is one such organization. Its mission is for companies to become carbon-neutral as quickly as possible.Enough customers care about the climate now, so it begins to become a potent aspect of a brand’s identity.Peter DeringCEO, Peak Designs
Climate Neutral offers a carbon emission calculator to identify impact. Companies get certified by Climate Neutral through a process that involves measuring footprint and offsetting emissions.
Companies can work toward addressing past and present emissions through carbon removal efforts and avoidance credits, said Austin Whitman, CEO of Climate Neutral. This helps highlight the return on investment of aggressive investments in reduced air shipping, clean electric vehicles for ground transport and other sustainability efforts, he said.
Connect offsets to delivery
Investing in carbon offsets — such as planting trees or using solar or wind energy — can be an important move to making the last mile more eco-friendly.
Ware2Go, a UPS warehouse fulfillment company based in Atlanta, is investigating this route.
It has recently partnered with Pachama, a San Francisco-based startup that builds a technology-verified marketplace for forest carbon offsets. Pachama monitors reforestation projects using satellite imaging and AI to ensure those projects’ ability to offset emissions.
Ware2Go is working with Pachama in efforts to fund reforestation, protect old-growth forests and improve forest management, according to the company.
“All of our merchants are automatically enrolled at no cost to them, so every business that is fulfilling with Ware2Go is participating in the program,” said Patrick Cadic, chief revenue officer at Ware2Go at the time of writing.
This investment will also help Ware2Go justify investment in other sustainable delivery options and innovative solutions, he said.
Market the green delivery option
The exponential rise of online shopping has added to traffic congestion in urban centers and to carbon dioxide emissions, to name just two issues researchers have found. Choosing a fast delivery time exacerbates these problems. Fast deliveries — in particular, next-day delivery or same-day delivery options — are particularly bad for the planet, which customers may not realize.
For example, a group of researchers at MIT found that fast shipping not only increases costs by up to 68%, it also increases total carbon emissions by up to 15%.
Communicating that information and giving consumers a slower-speed choice may help decrease harmful carbon emissions.
Researchers on the “green button project” at MIT are investigating this issue in depth. Their work suggests that companies can influence shopping habits by empowering consumers with green choices.
The researchers found that environmental explanations of slower delivery worked better than merely offering financial incentives. For example, 30% of customers who didn’t opt for slower delivery merely for economic incentives said they would be willing to wait longer for home deliveries when given environmental incentives.
The most effective way to motivate customers to wait was explaining their fast delivery choices in terms of trees.
When the MIT researchers gave consumers the choice between saving a hundred trees or opting for faster shipping, 40% said they’d wait. Researchers found that using trees to explain environmental impact has the potential for companies to cut their last mile delivery carbon footprint by 25%. They also believe it has the potential to increase customer satisfaction since the concept translates environmental issues into terms that are easy to understand and gives consumers a simple way to make a pro-environmental choice.
Use zero-emission delivery fleets
Last-mile delivery has traditionally relied on fossil fuel-powered delivery vehicles — a notorious source of carbon dioxide emissions — and supply chain leaders are beginning to look for alternatives to these.
Although delivery vehicles compose only a small portion of the traffic in urban centers, they generate more than half of overall emissions for certain contaminants, according to University of California Institute of Transportation Studies researchers. The use of zero emission and near-zero emission vehicles in the last mile is one way to help fight that. One concern about electric vehicles has been their limited range and performance compared to gas vehicles. But since 95% of parcel deliveries require ranges under 100 miles, commercially available zero-emission vehicles could easily fulfill these ranges.
Some cities are already exploring bicycle, drone and robot deliveries. Electric vehicles fall in this category as well.
Move to micro-fulfillment
Experts believe that enterprises can improve their sustainability by staging goods closer to consumers and solving some of the urban delivery issues.
Micro-fulfillment centers in the form of local smaller warehouse facilities, automated lockers, and click-and-collect points could help reduce harmful emissions and traffic congestion, according to an Accenture study on creating a sustainable last mile. A micro-fulfillment strategy in cities could reduce vehicle-related emissions by 16%-26% by 2025.
Revisit supply chain management strategies
Another complementary strategy lies in finding ways to optimize overall supply chain management methods around logistics, including better aligning the last mile with the rest of the distribution network.
One major consumer packaged goods company redesigned its supply chain to reduce the overall miles traveled by 11%, said Michael Zimmerman, partner in the strategic operations practice of global management consulting firm Kearney, headquartered in Chicago. The change produced a 10% improvement on $250 million in supply chain costs and reduced the company’s carbon footprint by 6,700 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.
Pack deliveries more efficiently
Since inefficient packing — often as a result of the push for fast deliveries — requires more vehicles to go out on the road, looking for packing efficiencies is a critical aspect of last-mile sustainability.
Consumer packaged goods companies are also finding ways to optimize the packaging dimension that reduces the pallets used, Zimmerman said. This can allow them to fit more products on each truck, lowering the total number of trucks on the road.
Teams can further improve sustainability by considering how the final container is packaged for transit, said Tara Milburn, founder and CEO of Ethical Swag, a Certified B Corp located in Novia Scotia, that distributes promotional products. This includes making sure the box is no larger than needed and that you’ve opted for sustainable packaging.
“This can be a complex process for many companies because shipment packages come in all shapes and sizes,” Millburn said. “It takes careful thought and consideration to make sure each client’s package is thoughtfully assembled.”
Explore sustainable packaging options
The amount of cardboard and plastic trash that home deliveries generate is staggering.
For example, in 2019 alone Amazon created 465 million pounds of plastic packaging waste, according a report from Oceana, a nonprofit organization.
The report focused on Amazon since it’s the giant of e-commerce, but other companies contribute to the issue, albeit on a smaller scale, and can learn from some of the takeaways.
For example, 86% of customers worried about plastic pollution, and 87% wanted Amazon and other retail giants to take major steps to reduce plastic packaging, including offering plastic-free packaging at checkout. Clearly, creating a more sustainable last-mile delivery requires funneling investments toward new packaging approaches. Prioritizing sustainable packaging options is key.
Realize greening the last mile is complicated
By 2030, demand for last-mile deliveries is expected to grow by 78% and emissions from those are expected to grow by more than 30% in 100 cities across the globe, according to a 2020 study by the World Economic Forum.
However, by forming public-private partnerships to create infrastructure improvements, looking for opportunities to improve sustainability as quickly as possible and exploring a variety of strategies, those numbers can change and companies can help bring emissions and costs down significantly.

How and why semi-autonomous e-scooters are defining the future path of mobility?
Over the years, the automobile industry has seen a significant rise. With advances in artificial intelligence and autonomous technology, automakers are rapidly turning to driverless vehicles racing to develop autonomous cars. Not only autonomous vehicles but automobiles are also making efforts towards sustainable transportation. The development of e-scooters is a decisive stride towards long-term sustainability. Electric scooters define as the future of urban mobility. They are eco-friendly, noise-free, and pollution-free. As these scooters are already starting to gain traction, many e-scooter makers are now building semi-autonomous e-scooters that can drive autonomously with the least human intervention.
Understanding Semi-Autonomous Vehicles
Semi-autonomous vehicles are those vehicles that require the least human intervention. They typically use advanced driver assistant technologies to minimize the effort required to manoeuvre the vehicle.
Concerns around enhanced safety and security are relentlessly powering the customers’ demand for semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicle technologies. The adoption of these technologies may differ in different regions. The economically advanced countries, or developing countries, have already adopted semi-autonomous and autonomous technologies. For example, Blind Spot Detection (BSD), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Adaptive Front Lights (AFL), Intelligent Park Assist (IPA) and Lane Keep Assist (LKA).
Semi-Autonomous E-scooters
Electric scooters, dockless, shared bikes and other vehicle types are significantly reducing the physical footprint needed to move people from one place to another, over relatively short distances. These vehicle services are known as micro-mobility, and these services have resonated with consumers, as evinced by their rapid adoption over just the last several months.
As electric scooters are becoming ubiquitous in the modern transportation ecosystem, giving them some sort of autonomy makes a considerable change in the e-scooter landscape.
In August 2019, Beijing-based e-scooter maker Segway Ninebot unveiled a new e-scooter that can drive autonomously to its charging stations. The e-scooter, dubbed as KickScooter T60, has reportedly been said to be controlled remotely from the cloud. In a chat with Reuters, Ninebot chairman and CEO Gao Lufeng explained that “AI-driven e-scooters could lower operators’ costs of maintenance and improve the economics of scooter sharing.”
In 2018, more than 85,000 dockless electric scooters hit streets in the United States. These e- scooters were rented for 38.5 million trips, making them the most prevalent form of shared micro-mobility, according to the National Association of City Transportation. This increasing growth and popularity of these scooters indicate the future of electric scooters is here to stay.
Flo Mobility, a Bengaluru-based two-wheeler autonomous vehicle developer, is harnessing the power of autonomous technology. The company is building semi-autonomous e-scooters, utilizing computer vision capabilities, artificial intelligence for obstacle identification, robotics and the Internet of Things sub-systems.
Giving Autonomy to E-Scooters
Key players in the electric scooter scenario understand the value of autonomous technologies that are worth pursuing. Tortoise, an autonomous delivery company, builds technology that coalesces driverless and remote-controlled features. These features can be integrated into any vehicle type – e-scooter, and shared, dockless vehicles. The purpose behind this is to allow rentable scooters and bikes that are currently being scattered around cities to self-deploy where needed to more readily match supply to demand, simplifying retrieval, charging, and replacement. Autonomous vehicles that move without direct human intervention will significantly ease the major logistical burden of companies. They will also reduce clutter on streets and sidewalks for cities.
Some of the top e-scooter companies and startups in the world are Lime, Bird, Tier, Bounce, Voi Technology, Ather Energy, Wheels, Wind Mobility, Dott, Scoot, Hero Electric, Etergo, and others.

Alphabet’s Google cut fuel use and traffic delays by 10 per cent to 20 per cent at four locations in Israel by using artificial intelligence to optimise signal lights and it next plans to test the software in Rio de Janeiro, the company said on Wednesday (Oct 6).
The early-phase research project is among new software initiatives inside Google to combat climate change. Some employees as well as advocacy groups have called on the company, the world’s third-most valuable, to more urgently use its influence to combat the crisis.
While Google has not addressed critics’ calls to stop selling technology to oil companies or funding lawmakers who deny global warming, it has prioritised sustainability features.
Google plans in the coming weeks to allow its Nest thermostat users to buy renewable energy credits for US$10 a month to offset emissions from heating and cooling. Credits will come from projects in Texas including Bethel Wind Farm and Roseland Solar. A majority of the funds will go toward credit purchases and utility-bill payment costs, Google said, without elaborating on the remainder.
For no charge across the United States, Nest users soon can automatically shift heating and cooling to times when energy is cleaner.
New informational panels alongside search results show emissions or other environmental ratings of flights globally and cars and home appliances in the United States. To stem misinformation, English, Spanish and French queries mentioning “climate change” starting this month will feature explanations from the United Nations.
Based on early results in Israel’s Haifa and Beer-Sheva, Rio de Janeiro’s municipal traffic authority expressed high hopes for the AI to better time traffic signal changes. It told Reuters the system should be introduced within months with locations announced soon.
Aleksandar Stevanovic, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, said simulations show AI could smooth traffic flow. But he questioned whether a tech company without traffic engineering expertise ultimately could bring such software to reality.
“Every year there is someone new claiming we can do wonders,” he said.

Multiple companies are working on new aerial modes of transportation, be they taxis that fly, drones that drive, or cars that drive and fly. What most of these vehicles have in common is that they’re intended for just a few people to ride in at once, like airborne Ubers. But a New York-based startup is thinking bigger, quite literally: Kelekona is developing an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle that will be able to transport 40 people at once.
The aircraft’s design is sleek and futuristic, with a flat shape not unlike a UFO. But for all the apparent flare of the design, Kelekona’s founder, Braeden Kelekona, actually has practicality on the brain; he told Digital Trends, “We have a really small airspace in New York. It never made sense to us to create a small aircraft that was only able to carry up to six people. You have to have the kind of mass transit we rely on here in the city. It makes sense to try to move as many people as possible in one aircraft, so that we’re not hogging airspace.”
He’s got a point. There’s a lot more space in the sky than on the ground, obviously, but flight paths need to be carefully planned and contained within specific areas, particularly in and near big cities. If flying taxis became affordable enough for people to use them the way we use Uber and Lyft today, there would quickly be all sorts of issues with traffic and congestion, both in the sky and with takeoff and landing space on the ground. So why not take a scaled approach from the beginning?
Speaking of affordability, Kelekona says that’s a priority, too. It may play out differently, especially in the technology’s early stages, but the intention is for tickets on the drone bus to cost the same as a train ticket for an equivalent distance. The first route, from Manhattan to the Hamptons, will reportedly have a 30-minute flight time and an $85 ticket price.
Other intended routes include Los Angeles to San Francisco, New York City to Washington DC, and London to Paris—all in an hour, which is comparable to the time it takes for a regular flight right now. One of the differences, ideally, will be that the eVTOLs will be able to land and take off closer to city centers, given that they won’t require long runways.
For this same reason, the company also envisions a streamlined approach to connecting warehouses; its aircraft will be able to carry 12 to 24 shipping containers, or a 10,000-pound cargo payload.
Moving that much weight, plus the weight of the aircraft itself, will demand a lot of battery power. The aircraft’s body will be made of 3D printed composite and aluminum and equipped with eight thrust vectoring fans with propellors whose pitch can change for the different stages of flight: vertical takeoff, forward flight, and landing. All of this will be built around a giant modular battery pack.
“Instead of building an interesting airframe and then trying to figure out how to put the battery into that aircraft, we started with the battery first and put things on top of it,” Kelekona said. The battery pack will have 3.6 megawatt hours of capacity, and will be built for easy swapping out with new iterations as battery technology continues to improve. The aircraft’s energy requirements will likely be the biggest challenge Kelekona faces in its design, production, and launch; at present, the aircraft is still in the computer simulation phase.
A British company called GKN Aerospace is developing a similar concept. Announced in February, Skybus would fit 30 to 50 passengers, and is intended for “mass transit over extremely congested routes.” Despite being made for vertical takeoff and landing, though, the aircraft design has large wings on either side; this would make it more challenging to find adaptable space in urban areas.

Self-driving vehicles won’t be widely viable commercially until their AI guidance systems are better than human drivers and can adjust to unpredictable road circumstances.
By Esther Ajao

When electric car giant Tesla recently introduced a beta of it latest full self-driving software then withdrew it, the abrupt reversal encapsulated the stop-start state of autonomous vehicle technology.
In a tweet on Oct. 23 about the withdrawal of the system, Tesla CEO and founder Elon Musk said it’s impossible at this point to test all configurations of a fully self-driving vehicle.
That dilemma is at the heart of the fitful progress on autonomous vehicle technology by major automakers such as Ford, General Motors and Hyundai, and tech giants including Apple, Google’s Waymo subsidiary and Amazon’s Zoox robotaxi subsidiary.
The industry must also overcome daunting challenges in ensuring safety.
While Tesla cars now have only limited autonomous capabilities, the company has made significant advancements, including putting cars on the road with limited self-driving features.
But some experts say Tesla’s chief limitations stem from a sensor suite that is not quite diverse enough. And different iterations of that problem also afflict other developers of autonomous vehicle technology.
Tesla relies on mainly cameras and software to perform all aspects of sensing the environment surrounding the car, leaving its level of autonomy at what is known in the industry as level 2, meaning the driver’s hands must always be on the wheel. Others in the industry that are developing level 3 or 4 technology (vehicles that don’t require limited help from the driver or don’t require a safety driver) are using a combination of cameras, software, lidar, radar and updateable HD maps.
“The advantage to adding these additional sensor modalities is that it provides redundancy across environmental conditions … and road types, and provide[s] an alternative method to distinguish certain roadway elements and actors,” said Matt Arcaro, an analyst at IDC.
Advances in autonomous vehicle technology
A prominent vendor in this area is Waymo. The Google subsidiary runs a self-driving taxi service in a section of Phoenix.
The vendor is also working on using the technology in other areas such as trucking, logistics and personal vehicles. Recently Waymo and GM’s Cruise division were the first autonomous vehicle technology vendors to obtain autonomous vehicle permits in California that would allow them to transport passengers.
Other promising projects involve traditional and new automotive manufacturers working on autonomous technology for robotaxis and personal vehicles.
For example, in 2019 Volkswagen said it would join Ford in investing in AI vendor Argo AI to introduce autonomous vehicle technology in the U.S. and Europe. The companies committed to spending more than $4 billion through 2023 to develop their self-driving service.
Another involves Intel subsidiary Mobileye and SIXT, a provider of mobility services in Germany; the vendors plan to offer robotaxis in Munich next year.
Amazon’s Zoox is designing autonomous vehicles from the ground up. The Zoox strategy is distinguished by its unique model, which is not designed like a car and doesn’t have a front or a back end or even a steering wheel.
The safety issue with autonomous vehicles
Despite the advances in the technology and interest in it from the public and enterprises, the autonomous vehicle industry is still up against many challenges, chief among them safety.
Although the industry is making progress in trying to make sure the technology is safe, regulation that could enforce safety requirements is largely absent, and it is mostly unclear still how local authorities will administer laws and regulations governing the use of autonomous vehicles.
Some states have enacted legislation for autonomous vehicles. Nevada requires manufacturers to meet detailed testing and safety rules; maintain a $5 million insurance policy to test vehicles on public roads; and, as of now, place a safety driver on board.
“If it’s vague out there that you’re relying on each individual provider to come up with their own definition of safety, that’s not the right way to do it,” Arcaro said.
And if autonomous vehicles are not as safe or even safer than human drivers, then there’s no point to them, said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Guidehouse.
Abuelsamid noted that while human drivers are criticized for being responsible for most crashes, people are good at driving and most of the time they drive, they don’t crash.
“We have not yet proven that autonomous vehicles can do the same, especially in the more challenging conditions,” he said. “We will undoubtedly have more crashes and more fatalities with autonomous vehicles because it’s impossible to make a system that complex perfect. But if we make it better than humans, then we’ll make progress.”
The uses of autonomous vehicle technology
Another challenge with the technology is figuring out where it’s useful.
Vendors such as Waymo, Uber and Motional — a joint venture between Hyundai and autonomous vehicle technology vendor Aptiv — are using the technology to develop robotaxis.
However, the goal and challenge for businesses is to find wide applications for the technology that can help them make money.
One industry that’s crying out for autonomous vehicles is trucking, which is suffering from a widespread shortage of drivers. An autonomous vehicle out on the highway is much simpler than guiding a vehicle autonomously in the city.
Waymo’s Via system uses cameras, software, lidar and radar configured to the specific requirements of truck driving. Startup vendor Aurora has put autonomous trucks on the road with backup human drivers. However, Aurora hopes to remove the drivers by 2023 when It fully launches its trucking business.
While there appears to be a real need for autonomous vehicles in the trucking business, Arcaro said other sectors are interested too, but self-driving is not like “turning on a light switch.”
“A lot of enterprises are a little skeptical because of initial timelines, but they’re also open to the technology,” Arcaro said.
Challenges for automated driving systems
Part of the reason that enterprises are still skeptical is because while some models are being tested, autonomous vehicle technology is still firmly in the testing phase.
Driving is an extremely difficult task for AI technology to understand, according to Abuelsamid.[Driving] takes a lot of nuance and nuance is something that computers and software are actually not good at.Sam AbuelsamidAnalyst, Guidehouse
“It takes a lot of nuance, and nuance is something that computers and software are actually not good at,” he said.
One reason is because AI is not as adaptable as the human brain and can fail in unpredictable ways.
The task of an automated driving system is broken down into four major steps:
The first step is sensing and perception, using a software system on top of a sensor array including cameras, radar, lidar and ultrasonic sensors. The sensors look at the world around the vehicle to detect what’s around it — in much the same way humans use their five senses to understand objects and distinguish them from each other.
The next step is to make sense of what all the different objects around the vehicle are. After that, the technology must be able to predict what the objects — including pedestrians, bicyclists, other vehicles and roadway items — might do within three to five seconds.
After the prediction, the next step is to plan a path for a vehicle to drive through that environment.
The final step is control. This is where the system sends signals to the steering and brakes and accelerator to make the car or truck go where it needs to.
“Perception is really hard for software,” Abuelsamid said. “AI systems can actually be fooled by subtle changes.”
One of the thorniest problems for autonomous vehicle technology is the prediction phase. While it might be easy for the autonomous vehicle to understand what other vehicles could do, pedestrians are relatively unpredictable and can easily change their minds at any moment.
“So, it has taken longer to create autonomous vehicles that can operate reliably in the kinds of environments with which humans have few problems,” Abuelsamid said.
For engineers, it’s about being able to manage and deploy a system that can support not only 99% of what is predictable, but also the small fraction that is unpredictable, Arcaro said.
“That last one percent is very difficult,” he continued. “That’s what’s keeping cars off the road today.”
The possible workaround
Some vendors are already finding ways around these problems and taking multiple pathways, Abuelsamid said.
They are deploying multiple algorithms instead of just one for perception. Rather than having software rely on cameras, lidar or radar, developers are using them all together. In some cases, vendors use both a deterministic approach and a probabilistic approach in their development of autonomous vehicles.
The deterministic approach is traditional and rules-based, Abuelsamid said. This is when an input signal to the algorithm will always yield the same result and the algorithm’s path is fully traceable.
“This is a well understood and reliable but sometimes limited approach,” Abuelsamid said
The probabilistic or AI approach uses complex models with many parameters that are often determined by the algorithm itself with a training process in which known, labeled data is fed to the algorithm.
The subsets within this category includes machine learning or neural networks. The algorithms will usually produce a probable answer about the likelihood that an object is a pedestrian or a vehicle According to Abuelsamid, the systems tend to be brittle and can sometimes give the wrong response in unexpected ways.
Making algorithms reliable
Most developers are now combining both approaches and breaking their software down into smaller chunks so that even if a specific algorithm can’t be traced, the problem can be isolated.
“By using all of those together, you can mix and match them in different ways so that you can verify what you think the system can verify … and have a more accurate result,” Abuelsamid continued. “Having that redundancy built in really turned out to be really important to have a safe and reliable system.”
Another way vendors are trying to attack this problem is by focusing on one industry. While some vendors zero in on the robotaxi industry, others are looking at the delivery industry.
As some focus on trucking on highways because it’s simpler than driving in the city and doesn’t contain many intersections, others are reining in the scope of their version of autonomous vehicle technology by geography, location or weather conditions.
“What we’re seeing now are companies that are limiting the problem set in some way, and having a limited design domain,” Abuelsamid said.
One autonomous vehicle vendor that has been somewhat successful in constraining the problem set is Motional. Motional transports passengers in Las Vegas through a partnership with Lyft. The company said it has conducted more than 100,000 public rides with two safety drivers in the front seat.
Earlier this year, Motional began testing driverless vehicles in Las Vegas after a two-year safety evaluation period and testing self-driving taxis with a safety driver. The company says it will launch a driverless service in 2023 through its partnership with Lyft, without a safety driver.
The Motional method
Meanwhile, Motional is still working to ensure its technology can handle unpredictable situations without a safety driver.
The vendor is using a machine learning-first approach and a continuous learning framework, said Sammy Omari, vice president of engineering and head of autonomy.
The continuous learning framework automatically detects unusual situations or objects, produces training data automatically in the Motional system and enables engineers and data scientists to retrain quickly and redeploy if the performance evaluation is good enough in simulation.
“This automatic loop allows us to get better, build a better autonomy and handle these kinds of rare situations better with every single mile we drive,” Omari said.
Motional also uses the continuous learning framework to mine for unexpected situations and determine if its prediction system is responding correctly.
If the prediction system does not respond correctly, Omari said, that data is put into the training data that is used to train the model or system. In some cases, the data may also be placed into the model validation set and used to re-create simulation scenarios.
One challenge Motional faces with the continuous learning approach is that it’s working with a large volume of data, as well as hundreds of cars that are out on the road every day.
Processing all that data, pushing it into the cloud and mining for relevant scenarios to create the training and retraining data is also challenging. Another hurdle to overcome is to keep the costs of doing all that for each vehicle under control.
“If you want to pull the safety driver out, you need to have the confidence that you have the right behavior of hundreds or thousands and millions of files,” Omari said.

-There are an estimated 975,000 telematics insurance policies active in the UK, according to the latest figures from TheBritish Insurance Brokers’ Association (2018) out of approximately 33 million registered cars.
-Telematics car insurance is a way to track and score someone’s driving and thus decide how much to charge you for car insurance.
-This is particularly important for young drivers who would otherwise face high or unaffordable car insurance premiums.
-Young drivers, careful drivers and low mileage drivers can save up to 60% at renewal by installing a telematics product in their car, which reports the quality of their driving back to the insurance provider via GPS.  In fact, it is predicted 88% of new cars will carry integrated telematics within five years.
– insurethebox proactively communicates with its policyholders who display risky driving behaviours, providing them with the information they need to improve their driving. Amongst its communications is their award-winning Speed Reduction Programme,  which has seen upwards of 86,000 drivers reduce their speed by 22%, leading to a 6% reduction in accident frequency amongst its customers – helping to prevent an estimated 1,191 accidents and a further 50 serious injuries in the past 5 years
-Warren Hetz, UK CEO of Aioi Nissay Dowa Europe, parent company of insurethebox comments: “Our telematics products have long-provided an opportunity for drivers to improve their driving behaviour and earn rewards by providing a level of insight unavailable with traditional insurance. As a business, we observe the benefits of safer driving by our customers on a daily basis, and through this partnership with one of the UK’s pioneers in the insurance comparison space, we endeavour to expand our reach and provide these benefits to more drivers, of all ages.”

Across Australia and around the globe, Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) are already making road travel safer, more efficient and more sustainable. Such systems are only becoming more and more relevant as population grows and the number of vehicles on the roads increases, with various ITS technologies offering solutions to decrease congestion, increase efficiency and mobility, and even save lives.
Fundamentally, ITS involves integrating information and communication technologies into transport systems to optimize operations. ITS encompass a broad range of systems and technologies, with varying levels of complexity and automation.
While smart systems can be applied to any form of transport, the term ITS is most frequently used in reference to road transport. The ‘currency’ of any ITS is its data, which is used to improve the transport system’s operations, often in real time.
As such, ITS employs a variety of wired or wireless technologies to collect, transmit, communicate and interpret data, with many also including automated control functions.
ITS infrastructure may involve technologies integrated into road networks (e.g. roadside sensors), within the vehicles themselves, or both. Essentially, ITS enhances connections between road users, vehicles, road infrastructure and transport system operators.
ITS solutions are generally applied to do one or more of the following:
Improve the mobility of people or goodsIncrease safetyReduce traffic congestion and increase transport efficiencyInform road users of conditionsRespond effectively to incidents and emergenciesIncrease the resiliency of the transport system in case of changed conditions or unforeseen disruptionsReduce air pollution or improve energy efficiencyAutomate billing processesAchieve policy objectives (such as demand management or transport priority)
Its infrastructure in action
ITS fulfill various vital functions on our roads, reaping significant benefits for road users and operators, as well as for our broader society and economy.
Traffic management
ITS traffic management is concerned with the overall management of traffic on a road. The ITS detects traffic situations and deploys traffic control strategies. Technology is applied to traffic signalling systems, traffic safety, and route and congestion management.
For example, the busiest roads around Melbourne, including the M80 Ring Road, Tullamarine, West Gate and Monash freeways, Eastlink and Citylink, use coordinated dynamic ramp metering to measure and regulate the number of vehicles entering and exiting in real time.
This enables each road to handle the maximum number of vehicles while maintaining traffic flow, reducing travel times and preventing safety issues associated with congestion.
Controlling traffic signals to only allow a certain number of vehicles to merge onto a road at a time helps break up groups of vehicles that might otherwise be competing for space, reducing the likelihood of collisions. Ramp metering signals that become operational during peak times have also been deployed as part of Sydney’s $600 million M4 Smart Motorway project.
Similarly, ITS such as the Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS) employ in-pavement detectors and other sensors at busy intersections to monitor demand for right-of-way and shifts in direction of demand.
Traffic signals then adapt accordingly, resulting in a smoother flow of traffic and minimising wait times. The SCATS Priority Engine also allows essential vehicles (such as emergency services) to be prioritised through traffic lights.
In Queensland, Hold the Red, an innovative intersection crash avoidance system trialled at four intersections in Brisbane and the Gold Coast, demonstrates the potential of ITS to prevent traffic incidents and enhance safety. The system uses radar to predict when a vehicle approaching the intersection is going to run a red light.
When this occurs, the system extends the all-red phases of lights at the intersection by two seconds, preventing other vehicles or pedestrians from entering the intersection where they could collide with the offending vehicle.
Traveller information
A common function of ITS technology is to better inform road users about road, environment and traffic conditions. These services enable road users to plan the most efficient route, avoid delays and quickly become aware of any changed conditions, potential hazards or emergency situations.
For instance, signs may display current travel times or advise of incidents or lane closures, or real-time information about conditions might be conveyed via highway advisory radio or reflected in GPS data.
Real-time traffic information signs and variable message signs are employed on a variety of roads around Australia, while certain busy car parks use parking guidance systems to advise of parking availability.
For example, the Parramatta Parking Finder helps support people with accessibility issues by providing information about accessible parking spaces around the Parramatta CBD including photos of the space and a rating out of five for the size of the space, hoist suitability and kerb ramp access.
Some of the potential benefits of ITS integrated with connected and semi-autonomous vehicles have been demonstrated by a trial undertaken by the Victorian Department of Transport on Eastlink, which involved the operational deployment of semi-AVs and cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS).
The project developed a DSRC messaging platform that delivered real-time road warnings in a high-speed environment, with high reliability and precision (to location and lane), without interfering with the existing tolling system.
Emergency management and response
The real-time monitoring capabilities of ITS can greatly reduce emergency response times, saving lives, preventing secondary incidents and reducing disruptions.
For instance, if a collision occurs, the relevant authorities are alerted, and the nearest emergency vehicle is located and dispatched to the scene.
Other drivers on the road can be alerted through dynamic signage and signals may change to prevent too many vehicles entering the area of the accident until it is safe to do so.
In South Australia, on the section of the North-South Corridor between Torrens Road and River Torrens, a Thermal Video Incident Detection System detects slowing, stopped or wrong direction vehicles within 5-15 seconds, fast-tracking incident response actions.
These include notifying drivers of lane closures and congestion using variable message signs and monitoring the situation with CCTV pan-tilt-zoom cameras.
Meanwhile, the Queensland Police Service employs drones and motorcycles to expedite serious crash scene clearance times, allowing traffic managers to estimate the duration and severity of congestion impacts and use existing ITS technologies to help manage congestion and prevent secondary incidents.
Using drone technology to map crash scenes, the Forensic Crash Unit has reduced scene mapping time by 50 per cent, reducing road closure times and traffic congestion, while also improving the quality of evidence captured at scenes.
In Brisbane, a structural health monitoring system has been developed to detect damage to the iconic old Sir Leo Hielscher Bridge (the Gateway Bridge) in real time, before it can affect public safety. These are just some of the ways in which ITS are currently transforming Australian road travel, with much more to come.
As the field of ITS continues to develop rapidly, the deployment of smart systems on our roads can help address significant social, economic and environmental issues.
With the costs of congestion predicted to rise to as much as $40 billion by 2030, and over a thousand lives still lost on our roads each year, we cannot afford to miss this opportunity to reap significant benefits at a relatively low cost, leveraging data to revolutionise road transport.

 A pause in one of the largest transit systems in the U.S. inspired an award-winning pilot project to improve public transportation. 
 By Steve Mazur

Throughout America’s history, cities that have invested in a reliable and robust network of roads, bridges and public transportation have been key to the growth of the nation’s economy.
Take Chicago, for example. The city ranks third in economic output in the country. Chicago is home to one of the best and largest public transit systems, second only to New York City’s.
Before the coronavirus pandemic, the Chicago Transit Authority reported bus and rail ridership totaled 455.7 million rides in 2019 (237.3 million bus rides and 218.4 million rail rides). In 2020, ridership plummeted amid the pandemic, particularly during March, April and May.
By the end of 2020, the CTA reported bus and rail ridership had risen to 197.5 million (121.5 million bus rides and 76.0 million rail rides). While this reflects a 57.6 percent average drop in ridership from 2019, it is a steady climb from its lowest point during lockdowns, when most city buses and trains were empty.
Restoring ridership to pre-pandemic levels has presented a major challenge for cities across the country, and Chicago is no exception. According to the CTA, 1.6 million bus and train rides are taken on an average weekday across the regional CTA transit system that serves the greater metropolitan region, inclusive of the city and 35 suburbs. Certain routes operate around-the-clock.
Because it is viewed as the circulatory system driving the economic vitality of Chicago, the CTA recognized the urgent need for a way to collect and analyze vehicle capacity in order to optimize routes, increase rider comfort and improve the passenger experience —all cornerstones to bringing riders back.
Chicago Gets Real-Time Data to Improve Transit Service 
As is the case for many transit agencies, much of the CTA’s data on transit vehicle capacity was incomplete, not available in real time or based on historic averages that may or may not reflect current realities, especially in the face of changing public health guidelines.
Without accurate real-time occupancy data and demand forecasts, the CTA had no insight into when and where to adjust service to ensure efficiency and reliability, appropriate social distancing, and shorter wait times.
To leverage its existing data and collect new data through advanced technology, the CTA turned to City Tech Collaborative, a Chicago-based urban solutions accelerator, which spearheaded a passenger-counting pilot project to understand vehicle occupancy in real time. The pilot was deployed on 10 buses from March to August along the CTA’s 79th Street bus route, one of the agency’s busiest, measuring the efficacy of various passenger-counting technologies.
The pilot served several purposes:
Capturing demand and using data from existing bus video assetsUsing data management tools to support CTA operationsApplying analytics and predictive models for proactive demand management
Building on the CTA’s existing measures and passenger-counting technology to keep bus and train service timely, efficient and safe, City Tech and an ecosystem of partners implemented video analytics, onboard cameras and routers to provide real-time insights into occupancy across multiple vehicles.
The pilot project recently received the IoT Deployment of the Year Award from IoT World Today, demonstrating the value of IoT technology in helping the CTA proactively meet route ridership demand; reduce passenger crowding and wait times; and provide a safe, socially distanced rider experience.
How to Streamline Technology Within Transit Agencies
A forthcoming report from the CTA will show how this model holds great potential for solving current challenges within core functions of society, as well as for building a solid foundation for future operations that prioritize the greater good.
Over the years, transit agencies have gradually added different applications and systems to their fleets of vehicles, such as:
Fare collection and payment terminal backhaulComputer-aided dispatch and automatic vehicle location (CAD/AVL)High-speed passenger internet accessPassenger countersClosed-circuit security camerasRemote engine diagnostics and fuel consumptionVehicle telematics, including information on speed and idle timeDigital maps, signage and advertising
However, implementing these applications and systems in a cost-effective way has been challenging. The municipal authority may have started with GPS navigation and vehicle tracking CAD/AVL systems, then later added onboard and in-terminal payment systems that needed backhaul to the central office. Then came passenger Wi-Fi, digital signage, security cameras and more.
The result for many transit agencies was a multitude of systems that do not integrate with one another and do not use the same internet connectivity methods and cellular carriers.
For municipalities already burdened with managing large fleets while maintaining an IT infrastructure on a tight budget, the challenges can stack up. With even more hardware, software and connectivity to maintain and manage, the risk of system failure only increases. The better answer is to consolidate all vehicle connectivity through a single, robust connection platform.
As unpredictability becomes the new norm, the future of transit belongs to agencies, operators and authorities that can leverage smart, secure and cost-efficient connectivity to improve the rider experience, lower costs, and improve safety and performance. In doing so, they invest in the continued economic growth of their cities as well as the American economy.

While Phoenix travel guides may not mention this, taking a ride in Waymo’s self-driving car should be at the forefront of that list. Travel the city via a fully autonomous vehicle you can book simply with an app on your phone.
Waymo, Google’s platform for driverless vehicles, provides fully autonomous cars seven days a week all around Phoenix. Dubbed ‘the World’s Most Experienced Driver’ by Alphabet AI, Waymo has driven over 20 billion miles so far, with the sole mission to make travelling easier and safer. In 2020, Alphabet expanded the tech to commercial trucks. 
Waymo calls itself a self-driving technology company rather than a self-driving car company. Their fleet of thousands of self-driving cars is powered with sensors like lidar, enabling driver-free operations and 360-degree perception technology to identify obstacles. 
Waymo, back in October 2020, announced its plan of launching fully driverless vehicles to the public. It is wholly focused on full autonomy. “We’re building systems that operate without any reliance on human drivers. Either the system can complete the entire trip, or it cannot,” the team at Waymo explained. 
In this article, we break down how Waymo leverages AI/ML to create their dominating technology. 
Territory Marking & Prediction
Before operating in a new area, the Waymo Driver maps the territory with a high detailing rate. This includes noting the stop signs or the curbs, and the platform adopts these into custom maps equipped with real-time sensor data. This information is later mixed with real-time details to gauge how the road users might behave and drive accordingly. 
Advanced Sensors
Waymo has claimed to have built the most advanced sensors and perception systems with quality data. The system dataset contains more than 20 million autonomously driven miles and five generations of development. 
Its fifth-generation Driver comprises complementary sensors that include radar, lidar, and cameras that allow it to see 360 degrees around the vehicle. This considers the time of the day, bad weather conditions like rain or fog, and the variety of road users such as those double-parked vehicles whose riders can hop out at any second or the scooters cutting across traffic through a red light.
Waymo Blog Post A dense and highly detailed 3D view of its surroundings as generated by the system’s lidar
These sensors allow the vehicle to navigate the city streets accurately and track objects around, especially while taking turns or changing lanes. “Because of the long-range and high density provided by our sensors, the Waymo Driver can detect with high accuracy, and intelligently reason about small objects and movement at distances – such as spotting a truck door slowly opening in the flow of traffic as a person gets ready to hop out and deliver some packages,” according to Waymo’s blog post.
Waymo’s compute platform allows the Driver to process vast amounts of data and run real-time inference on large ML models. This will enable it to react immediately without additional human input, like when an emergency vehicle is approaching or when a dog runs out into the street. They even do this without needing a cell signal to operate.
Software and Training Structure
Waymo’s driving software is based on years of AI research, their Waymo Open Dataset Initiative, and research team Google Brain. The engineers working at Waymo operate in coordination with the Google Brain team to apply deep nets to the car’s pedestrian detection system. 
The team has created a robust, generalisable tech stack based on their operation in multiple environments and cities. The Waymo Driver has learnt to behave assertively and merge into traffic based on this experience. 
Waymo has invested in creating training softwares for the Waymo Driver. The Simulation City is software to test the autonomous vehicles and assess their performance for the cities Waymo is present in. It creates realistic conditions like spring showers, solar glare, or dimming light for the technology to experience; the researchers further learn from the system’s reactions.

Waymo blog post: an illustration of how the Simulation City draws a random outcome from a statistical distribution of the real world. 
The Waymo Driver itself is trained with a highly nuanced understanding of city roads with driving experience of more than 20 million miles on public roads and 20 million miles in simulation. It can adapt to the local driving conditions accurately, given this training.
For instance, in San Francisco, the system has learnt that the residents often drive slower on steep slopes and adapt to change its speed depending on traffic flow. Waymo Driver makes similar calculations while approaching crosswalks or lower visibility areas.
Tensorflow Ecosystem
Waymo has adopted the TensorFlow ecosystem and the data centres of Google, such as TPUs, for training its neural networks. Their rigorous testing on simulations and training cycles allows it to enhance its ML and autonomous system.
SurfelGAN 
The platform is leveraging AI to generate camera images to simulate sensor data gathered through its self-driving vehicles.  
In a recent paper, the researchers introduced the technique – SurfelGAN. This uses texture-mapped surface elements for reconstructing scenes and camera viewpoints to handle positions and orientations. This is a considerably more accessible and more data-driven path to simulate sensor data. The AI generates and preserves data based on real-world lidar sensors and camera feeds. This data is regarding the semantics, 3D geometry, and object appearances on the scene used to render a simulated scene through the reconstruction. 
Currently, Waymo is the only company operating a fully autonomous public ride-hailing service in the U.S. They have partnered with many car manufacturers like Jaguar Land Rover or Volvo to integrate the self-driving technology into their vehicles and with OEMs to expose their Driver to more places and people.

						Waymo will start by mapping the city in preparation to deploy its fully self-driving vehicles.
											
					
Alphabet Inc’s autonomous driving arm Waymo,  which spun out of Google’s self-driving car project, is deploying its  autonomous vehicles in New York City. Beginning tomorrow, Waymo’s  mapping vehicles start mapping the city in preparation for a more  widespread deployment of fully-autonomous vehicles.
As
 one of the most densely populated cities in the world, New York poses 
difficult challenges for Waymo’s self-driving vehicles. The city’s 
streets are clogged with cars, pedestrians, bicyclists and delivery 
vehicles. 
Waymo plans to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service in major U.S. cities called “Waymo One“,  which is similar to Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing providers. More  recently, Waymo has been testing its autonomous vehicles in San  Francisco. 
“Autonomous vehicles hold the 
promise to dramatically improve traffic flow and expand access to 
convenient and affordable transportation for millions of New Yorkers,” 
said newly elected NYC mayor Eric Adams. “I’m excited to welcome Waymo 
to New York so that one day we can have safe autonomous technology on 
our streets.”
To successfully navigate in  this challenging environment, the first steps for Waymo are to fully map  the streets of New York City, since the company’s fleet of autonomous  vehicles relies on high-definition maps with centimeter-level accuracy for safe navigation.  These HD maps allow Waymo’s vehicles to navigate in places even where  GPS signals are spotty, such as in tunnels or between skyscrapers.
With
 the backing of Google over the years, Waymo has emerged as a leading 
developer of self-driving technology. The company’s fleet of autonomous 
vehicles has traveled over 20 million miles on public roads
 in cities across the U.S., with billions of more miles in computer 
simulation to perfect its autonomous driving platform that Waymo calls 
the “Waymo Driver.”
For the time being, 
Waymo’s mapping vehicles in New York will be manually operated by 
autonomous specialists at all times, the company said.
Testing  its vehicle in New York City will allow Waymo will give Waymo  opportunities to learn more about how its Waymo Driver handles urban  driving in snow, rain and other winter weather conditions. By assessing  the way Waymo vehicles perform in inclimate weather, Waymo will be able  to make improvements to its software based on real world scenarios, then  apply these learnings across its entire fleet.
Waymo’s
 New York fleet, which will start with five Chrysler Pacifica minivans 
outfitted with hardware to support autonomous driving and mapping 
capabilities, will primarily operate south of Central Park. Waymo said 
its areas of operation will extend down through the city to the 
Financial District and the southern end of Manhattan, as well as out to a
 small section of New Jersey through the Lincoln Tunnel, which connects 
New York to New Jersey across the Hudson River.
Waymo
 will also be driving its zero-emission Jaguar I-PACEs electric SUVs 
equipped with its latest technology on the same streets in Manhattan. 
The company said the insights gathered will help the Waymo Driver improve its ability to perceive and predict the actions of other road users in dense urban areas.
“The  more information we gather about the way our city moves, the closer we  get to creating a more efficient, sustainable, and safe mobility  network.” said Tech:NYC Executive Director Julie Samuels. “NYC is  excited to welcome Waymo to New York to help us learn how our streets —  from bike and bus lanes to highways and walkways — really work.”
In August, the Waymo One service opened to a select group of “trusted testers” in San Francisco.
 The company was recently approved to begin picking up passengers in its
 driverless vehicles for the first time, after years of extensive 
testing using safety drivers behind the wheel.
Waymo’s
 Trusted Tester pilot is a research-focused program that invites San 
Francisco residents to participate and help the company shape the future
 of fully autonomous ride-hailing. Waymo takes valuable feedback from 
its trusted testers to continuously improve its service. 
Prior to opening Waymo One to its trusted testers, the company was picking up its own employees in the city.
Just  like Uber and Lyft, the Waymo One service has a smartphone app where  customers can summon one of the company’s self-driving vehicles. Once  seated and bucked up, riders press the trip start button to begin their  trip. A monitor installed in the backseat of each vehicle shows the  vehicle’s perception systems in real time and riders get an expanded  look at what the self-driving vehicle “sees” as it navigates  autonomously in the city.
Riders also have a
 pull over button in case a passenger needs to cut their trip short. If a
 rider presses the button, the Waymo vehicles will pull over in a safe 
location and let them out.
Prior to 
launching the Waymo One service in San Francisco for select riders, the 
company has been testing its technology in the Phoenix Metro Area since 
2016, mapping streets and improving its self-driving software for the 
Waymo One ride-hailing service.
In September, Waymo and Cruise LLC, the autonomous driving unit of automaker General Motors, were
 issued permits by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to 
deploy their commercial self-driving vehicles in San Francisco and pick up paying customers.
The  permits pave the way for a more broader deployment of the Waymo One  autonomous ride-hailing services in the San Francisco Bay Area and in  other major cities like New York.

Chinese
 technology company Baidu Inc. is one of the world’s leading developers 
of autonomous driving technology with its open Apollo platform. In 
addition to developing an entire mobility ecosystem in China around self-driving vehicles,
 the company is working directly with three of China’s biggest 
automakers to install its autonomous driving hardware during the 
production phase, as opposed to modifying the vehicles after assembly. 
The
 vehicles are being mass produced by the three of China leading 
automakers, GAC, WM Motor and SAIC Group, to serve as robotaxis for 
Baidu’s “Apollo Go” ride-hailing service.
On Oct 26, Baidu launched the third of these “Apollo Moon”  robotaxis based on an electric SUV from AION, the new electric  sub-brand of Chinese automaker GAC which launched in 2018. The EV comes  with Baidu’s factory-installed autonomous driving system and is referred  to by Baidu as the “Apollo Moon AION version”.
The
 Apollo Moon AION SUV is built on the latest version of GAC’s GEP (GAC 
Electric Platform), which is designed for purely electric vehicles. It 
will accelerate the application of L4 autonomous driving and drive the 
era of shared mobility, according to Baidu.
“The  launch of Apollo Moon is an important breakthrough signifying the  powerful linkage between China’s leading autonomous driving technology  and the most advanced smart vehicle platform, marking a landmark step in  the field of robotaxi ride-hailing services globally,” said Li Zhenyu,  senior vice-president at Baidu.
The AION 
robotaxi is the third production vehicle from three different automakers
 that Baidu has added its autonomous driving hardware to. The other two 
are the Apollo Moon Arcfox from automaker BAIC Group’s electric sub 
brand Arcfox, which was released in June, and the Apollo Moon WM Motor, 
which is based on the W6 SUV from chinese automaker WM Motor. The W6 was
 officially launched on Oct 19.
The W6 from
 WM Motor is equipped with 12 cameras, 5 millimeter-wave radars and 12 
ultrasonic radars with L2+ autonomous driving capabilities. Baidu says 
its Apollo platform supports autonomous driving in dense urban areas as 
well as highway driving. 
Integrating 
Baidu’s Apollo autonomous driving technology in a production vehicle 
involved an R&D investment of 3 billion yuan ($469.91 million), 
according to Chinese news outlet Gasgoo. The platform features both autonomous driving software and hardware integration.
The
 Apollo Moon AION includes a customer-built LiDAR unit, a fully 
redundant design for added safety. If any sensors fail, the entire 
vehicle still executes autonomous driving commands and delivers 
passengers to a safe dropoff location.
Since  its based on a dedicated EV platform that supports better hardware  integration, the Apollo Moon AION features lower manufacturing cost per  car than that of the former-generation cars, while its overall  autonomous driving capabilities have been improved.
Baidu’s  Apollo Moon vehicles also use its “ANP-Robotaxi” architecture, which  can reduce the weight of autonomous vehicle hardware. The platform can  be used to share intelligent driving vehicle data with other Apollo Moon  vehicles to create a closed-loop information ecosystem that allows for  level-4 autonomous driving, which has not yet been achieved by the  industry. 
Apollo Moon also includes a 
precise failure detector and degradable processing algorithms, 
5G-powered remote monitoring services and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology.
Baidu plans to work with other automakers in the future to install its autonomous driving system in a higher number of vehicles at the factory. Baidu plans to have its Apollo intelligent driving solutions available in more than one million vehicles in the next three to five years, said Li Zhenyu, senior corporate vice president at Baidu, during a presentation in April at Auto Shanghai 2021.
Baidu’s Approach to Self-Driving Differs From Tesla and Waymo in the U.S.
Baidu’s  approach in the development of its self-driving technology differs from  that of Tesla and Alphabet’s autonomous driving division Waymo, which  spun out of Google’s self-driving car project. 
Speaking
 at the Emerging Engineering International Forum 2021, hosted by Peking 
University last week, Baidu CEO Robin Li spoke about the engineering 
mindset that drives Baidu’s business.
In 
his speech, Li shared his thoughts on how competitors like Waymo and 
Tesla approach the development of autonomous driving technology compared
 to Baidu. 
According to Li, Waymo’s  approach is a “scientific one”, aiming to achieve L5 first, then  expanding, scaling and commercializing the technology. Tesla however,  has taken an “engineering approach”, by gradually making incremental  advances in its self-driving technology. Baidu has instead prioritized  expanding the driving range of self-driving vehicles, by perfecting the  technology in a smaller geo-fenced area before expanded to a wider  region.
Li said in his speech that its 
impossible to deploy a self-driving car on the road and immediately be 
able to drive all 5 million kilometers of road in China. He says there 
are many factors that need to be tested and considered prior to 
achieving the highest level of safety for autonomous vehicles. 
By
 practicing the operation of self-driving cars in smaller areas where 
the conditions are more conducive to testing, Baidu argues that its able
 to gradually learn and improve its autonomous driving capabilities 
before expanding to a wider geographical area.
Baidu
 is often referred to as the “Google of China”, has been working to 
deploy commercial autonomous driving technology at scale as part of its 
open Apollo platform since 2017. The Apollo platform is designed to 
speed up the development of self-driving technology through 
collaboration with industry partners.
Since
 its launch, Apollo’s development work has grown significantly. Baidu is
 working with over 200 industry partners as part of Apollo, including 
automakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen, and hardware manufacturers Intel
 and Nvidia.
The Apollo platform is often 
referred to as the “Android of the Automotive Industry.” It’s the 
largest open-source autonomous driving platform in the world, according 
to Baidu. 
Baidu called the integration of 
its autonomous driving technology in the three Apollo Moon robotaxis “a 
monumental milestone in the large-scale commercialization of fully 
autonomous ride-hailing services in China.”
During
 the company’s annual Baidu World 2021 conference in August, Li unveiled
 his vision for mobility of the future in the form of a futuristic 
“robocar” designed to make autonomous vehicles more accessible to the 
broader public. 
The robocar features automated gull-wing doors and a transparent glass roof to  make the interior feel more spacious for passengers. Each vehicle  includes a suite of external sensors for safe navigation on public  streets. Baidu says its robocar is capable of level 5 autonomous  driving, meaning that no human intervention is ever required.
The  over design of the robocar is bold and differs from traditional vehicle  designs, with no steering wheel, pedals or other controls for a human  operator.

The world, as we know it today, bears no resemblance whatsoever to the yesteryears. Advancements in technology have disrupted every possible industry and the automotive sector is no stranger to it. There has been an increasing change in the way people look at transportation. In fact, the very term and concept is being shifted from ‘transportation’ to ‘mobility.’ Where traditional transportation was a “system-centric” concept, modern mobility is completely “user-centric,” recognizing the fact that transportation must be responsive to the needs and preferences of commuters and society. Let’s find out why cities should rethink parking as ride-hailing services grows.
Ride-Hailing Services on the Rise
The new concept of shared-use mobility which lies at the centre of New Mobility Services (NMS) allows users access to various modes of transportation – bicycles, motorbikes, and cars – on a short-term and on-demand basis.
Mobility-as-a-service has emerged as a thriving concept with several push forces and enablers responsible for its popularity – one of the main push forces being a millennial aversion to car ownership. And what’s more, is that one of the main reasons the Gen-Z is against car ownership is the stress related to parking.
And the key enablers of ride-hailing services are smartphone applications and smart parking technologies such as IoT working in tandem to connect paying passengers with drivers who offer rides for a certain fee (for their private vehicles).
These ride-hailing services are easy to use and understand. Via a user-friendly smartphone application, the user simply needs to input their drop-off destination (with the pick-up destination either automatically entered through their phone’s GPS or manually entered on the map)and opt for the vehicle type (mini, micro, sedan, etc.) and the ride type (full or share) that best suits their needs and budget and book their ride.
Since these ride-hailing services recommend vehicles that are lurking nearby the pick-up location, the driver generally arrives within minutes of the booking. All that is now left to do is enjoy the ride and make the payment on arrival. How hassle-free is that!
How Cities are Coping with the Revenue Loss
Ever since the concept of mobility-as-a-service has emerged, there has been a bi-directional relationship between it and parking. And why not! After all, one of the top reasons cited for favouring ride-hailing services over car ownership is the increasing stress, hassle, and time and money loss involved in finding a vacant parking spot.
Ride-hailing does alter the parking demand. No longer is parking viewed as a necessary evil, with the degree of its necessity constantly decreasing. With ride-hailing services, people can easily access destinations of their choice without requiring an accompanying parking space. As a result, the demand for parking spaces is seeing a fall. This, in turn, has naturally led to revenue loss for the parking industry.
Cities are compelled to reduce the supply of parking spots and to look for alternative ways of allocating existing, unused parking infrastructure towards other needs and land uses. The diminished value and use of parking infrastructure offer the opportunity to put them to more in-demand and purposeful uses – parks, plazas, and similar elements – that make a city more lively and habitable.
Moreover, the low demand for parking spots owing to lesser driving trips and declining car ownership has proven to be insightful, allowing cities to rethink and better manage curb space – allocating more space for walking and bicycling, and most importantly, monetizing car trips (both private vehicles and ride-sharing vehicles) to cover up the losses incurred. For example – several airports have started charging ride-hailing vehicles a pick-up and drop-off fee for the curb space allotted to them.
Even the rise in mobility services such as ride-hailing can have their downsides – cab-sharing drivers wandering around with no passengers (dead-heading), unnecessary traffic congestions, and decline of sustainable travel options such as walking and bicycling. However, the root of the issue lies in the misuse of spaces – no proper space seems to be available for walking and bicycling.
Hence, the need of the hour is to make cities livable on a human scale with increased space for more sustainable transportation options and to allow technology to adapt to it – a truth more and more cities are waking up to.

 Autonomous tech could lead to deaths at the hands of robots. But is continuing to let humans drive even worse? 
By Rani Molla
LaBystLast year saw a jump in the number of car fatalities, even as the pandemic kept many Americans off the roads. The number of deaths per 100 million miles driven grew 24 percent from a year earlier. It was the biggest single-year rise on record — and 2021 is on track to be just as bad. At the same time, the promise of autonomous cars has never been closer. Waymo and Tesla are continually improving their autonomous capabilities, drawing the tantalizing prospect of markedly less human suffering ever nearer. But getting to that future is complicated.
The decision to switch to autonomous vehicles presents a very modern take on an old ethical dilemma: the famed trolley problem.
This thought experiment involves a trolley car driver on a collision course with a group of pedestrians. The driver can do nothing and kill several people on the track ahead or take action, switching tracks so that just one person dies. These days, doing nothing means that about 1.3 million people will die each year globally in regular car accidents, the leading cause of death in people under 30. Switching tracks would involve more rapidly developing and adopting autonomous vehicles that could eventually prevent thousands of deaths per day. The problem is that the technology has a long way to go before it can drive people safely on its own in everyday conditions. In the meantime, it could lead to deaths at the hands of robots, if not humans.
Waymo and Tesla are at the forefront of the driverless car push and thus have a front seat to this dilemma. Both have similar goals — to safely transport people in autonomous vehicles — but they are operating with wildly different strategies.
Waymo, which shares a parent company with Google, is slowly and methodically rolling out its autonomous vehicles in the form of a robo-taxi service. The company boasts it has logged well over 20 million miles of autonomous driving without a single death. But currently, regular people can only ride in one of several hundred Waymo vehicles, in sunny Phoenix. Last week, the company got permission to launch its taxi service (with a human monitor behind the wheel) in a second city — San Francisco — where hills, weather, and traffic complicate the task. The company eventually plans to launch in other cities and license its automated driver technology to car manufacturers. But Waymo doesn’t know when that will happen because, as its co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana told Kara Swisher at the September 2021 Code Conference, the company is “in the process of learning.”
“It’s, I would say, the engineering challenge of our generation. That’s what’s taking it so long,” Mawakana said. “Safety takes time.”
In the meantime, people will continue to die in car accidents, with 94 percent of fatal car crashes caused by human error.
Tesla, on the other hand, has rolled out autonomous features much more quickly. In September, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that drivers with a record of safe driving and who paid for the feature could request permission to beta test its “Full Self-Driving” technology. It includes more advanced driver assistance featuresthan Autopilot, Tesla’s existing semi-autonomous feature, which helps drivers steer, brake, and accelerate within a lane.The company claims that the hardware — but not the software, which is still being tested — in new Teslas is capable of “full self-driving in almost all circumstances” and is “designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat.” According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there are currently no fully automated or self-driving cars for sale, and such technology is years away.
The head of the National Transportation Safety Board has said that Tesla should fix existing safety deficiencies before rolling out the new tech. Meanwhile, other Tesla critics say that names like “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving” cause people to place more faith in the technology than they should, erroneously taking their hands off the wheel or not paying attention.
This dissonance has resulted in tragedy. In August, the NHTSA opened a formal investigation into Autopilot after crashes involving Teslas and emergency vehicles (12 so far). The agency has also opened special investigations into accidents suspected to have happened while advanced driver assistance systems were engaged and which have resulted in 12 deaths.
Musk maintains that, despite the deaths, these cars are 10 times safer than regular cars.
“Even if you, for argument’s sake, reduce fatalities by 90 percent with autonomy, the 10 percent that do die with autonomy are still gonna sue you,” Musk told Swisher at Code. “The 90 percent that are living don’t even know that that’s the reason they’re alive.”
There’s some truth to that. By taking humans out of the equation, autonomous cars have the potential to save lives and alleviate incalculable social and economic losses. As NHTSA put it, “Fully automated vehicles that can see more and act faster than human drivers could greatly reduce errors, the resulting crashes, and their toll.”
The key is getting to that future quickly without jeopardizing it by causing the very harm you’re attempting to stop.
Two roads traveled
If the goal is to get autonomous driving assistance to the masses, Tesla is closer. If the goal is to have cars that safely drive themselves, Waymo is winning.
“Tesla is doing high-altitude flights or near-space flights, and Waymo is landing on the moon,” Mike Ramsey, vice president at research firm Gartner, told Recode. “One is trying to achieve something that’s far harder to do than the other. But that’s not to say that the high-altitude flights can’t keep getting higher and higher.”
In other words, while Tesla probably won’t be delivering a fully autonomous vehicle anytime soon — despite its misleading naming — it could incrementally get better and better assistance features that would eventually lead to true self-driving capabilities.
Tesla vehicles are considered to be at level 2 on the engineering society SAE International’s automation scale. That means Tesla’s system requiresconstant driver supervision, even if the assistance features are handling some of the steering and braking. Waymo vehicles are level 4, meaning the car can drive itself under limited geographic conditions and doesn’t need driver supervision. However, the technology that powers them is not ready for mass-market use outside of its test areas.
Waymo’s hardware is much more robust than Tesla’s. It uses several redundant sensor systems, including lidar, radar, and cameras, to create a real-time picture of where it’s operating. The company also maps areas ahead of time by having human drivers manually drive the vehicles through them. Meanwhile, Tesla vehicles rely exclusively on cameras and ultrasonic sensors.
“The more sensors you have, it adds to the complexity of the system, but it also makes it way safer,” Ramsey said.
Cameras aren’t as accurate at gauging distance as lidar or radar, andtheir ability to map an area can be impaired by everyday hazards like snow, dust, or darkness. However, cameras are a lot cheaper, and that matters when it comes to getting this technology into consumers’ hands.
You can purchase a souped-up Model 3 Tesla for around $75,000. However, experts don’t think Tesla vehicles could be fully autonomous with their current hardware, and will likely need to incorporate other technology like lidar to get there. We don’t know the exact price of Waymo vehicles — which are Chrysler Pacificas and Jaguar I-Paces outfitted with Waymo’s sensors and autonomous driver tech — but the company’s former CEO previously said it “cost no more than a moderately equipped Mercedes S-Class,” which has a price tag of about $180,000. Waymo says its costs have come down significantly with the latest generation.
But by selling its vehicles to the general public, Tesla is able to collect lots of real-world driving data that will be useful in helping solve autonomous driving challenges. Raj Rajkumar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and an autonomous vehicle pioneer, calls Tesla’s data collection an “incredible advantage” but warns that data is “part of the answer, but it’s not the entire answer.” Still, he thinks Waymo ought to collect more of it from regular drivers in regular conditions.
“We should be driving them whenever they can drive themselves and, when they do not, humans drive themselves,” Rajkumar said. “And for a time we collect experience. We understand what works, what does not work, and we refine.”
Tesla’s relatively wide reach also means rolling out a truly autonomous vehicle, when they eventually make one, will be a lot easier.
“Tesla’s strategy is interesting because, if it works, it could be a lot more scalable. They could launch a lot faster in other cities than their competitors could,” Tasha Keeney, an analyst at Ark Invest, which has a large stake in Tesla, said. Keeney said a faster rollout of autonomous vehicles will hasten a safer driving future, but it won’t be without cost.
“Are computers better than humans at driving? I think yes,” she said. “Will there be mistakes along the way? Yes.”
What’s next for autonomous vehicles?
Experts estimate that we could have level 3 or 4 cars for sale within the next 10 years. But in the meantime, it’s important not to overlook the benefits that the pursuit of autonomous cars has already wrought. Cars will soon be able to reliably take over in some instances, say, on the highway — where the lanes are clearly marked and the rules are pretty clear — but humans might take over on city streets.
Already a number of advanced driver assistance features are showing up on regular vehicles. Automatic emergency braking, technology that automatically slows or stops the car before it hits an object, has been shown to reduce injuries and fatalities and will be standard on most vehicles sold in the US next year. Consumers can expect more of these features to spill over from the quest for autonomous vehicles in the next few years.
“We should all stop thinking in terms of something magical will happen and all of a sudden cars will become self-driving,” Rajkumar said. Rather, the shift will happen feature by feature, after many tests and improvements. “That last change will be so incremental you won’t be able to realize it happened over the last five to 10 years.”
When cars do become fully autonomous, there are also benefits beyond safe driving. Keeney said autonomous technology would also greatly reduce the cost of travel because of cars’ increased utilization as taxis, without the expense of a driver. “It’ll give a lot of people access to very inexpensive point-to-point travel, which could totally change our lives and how we get around.”
In the meantime, perhaps the path forward for self-driving cars isn’t a binary choice at all. We’ll likely see a spectrum of improvements from many car companies as they incorporate more and more driver assistance features. And although in the near term the tech might not be the self-driving future we were promised, it will be better than nothing.
“We should not lose sight of the benefits the technology can bring,” Rajkumar said. “It takes time, but we’ll eventually get there.”

Every service has a last mile – that final, physical meeting between consumer and provider. We tend to equate the “last-mile” concept with retail, with the delivery vans that move from distribution center to doorstep.
But healthcare has its last mile – and its last-mile frictions, too. That can mean scheduling the appointments, getting in the car, making one’s way to the doctor or provider – oftentimes dedicating a huge swath of the day to the task.
It’s no secret that the pandemic has forced us all to go online for daily interactions, and that telehealth has been widely adopted. But much of healthcare – such as the preventive efforts that can catch illnesses before they become life-threatening – is tangible, requiring needles, vials, labs and technicians.
We tend to skip appointments for the needed checkups, the blood draws and the other diagnostic tests that are so essential to treatment.
There’s a way to solve the last-mile gap here, as Sprinter Health co-founders Cameron Behar (CTO) and Max Cohen (CEO) told Karen Webster: Bring lab services and testing into the home environment – on demand.
“A lot can be done to solve the problem of access in healthcare,” said Cohen, who posited some key questions about access: “How can we try and get these critical diagnostics, especially these new generations of tests, to patients in a way that’s affordable, accessible, flexible – driving a great patient experience?”
To that end, Sprinter Health announced earlier this month that it has come out of stealth mode with a $33 million investment via Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from General Catalyst, Accel, Google Ventures (GV) and other leading investors.
At a high level, the company said, Sprinter Health addresses the last mile in healthcare by making access to a range of tests and vitals checks as simple as ordering food to be delivered to the home.
In terms of the mechanics, “sprinters” – defined by Cohen and Behar as “tech-savvy phlebotomists” – conduct a range of at-home lab work services at a patient’s home, spanning blood draws, vitals checks, urine sample collection or COVID-19 checks.
The duo said that its technology uses real-time messaging to keep patients apprised about sprinters’ progress. They utilize a “checklist,” said Behar, to complete as services are performed.
Cohen and Behar, with stints at Google and Facebook, come from technology backgrounds, and both had fathers who were doctors. And Cohen, with a long history of suffering from an undiagnosed herniated disk, had firsthand experience with the problems that untreated conditions can cause.
“There’s some amazing technology coming out, but the problem is that it’s not getting in the hands of providers fast enough,” said Cohen. Or providers may have technology in hand, but patients lack access. Individuals may be homebound, or working parents may be unable to schedule time to get to the lab and have blood taken.
That’s a problem in a world where 70% of medical decisions start with a diagnosis, which in turn starts with a lab test. To get a sense of how the tech-enabled, on-demand model can solve for some of the frictions in the last mile of healthcare, Cohen pointed to pre-chemotherapy lab draws.
Cancer patients who travel for treatment have to visit the provider after having blood drawn the day before the treatment. They may be sent home before getting chemo if their white blood cell counts are not satisfactory, he said. But with in-home testing, said Cohen, “you get a text message that we’re on the way, you get a picture of who’s going to be showing up. We come in, and we’re in and out of the house. In under six minutes, we can get that test out” to be examined and confirmed by a physician that same day – paving the way for a timely chemotherapy session.
As Behar and Cohen explained, Sprinter Health can be viewed as an infrastructure play into the healthcare system, serving as connective tissue between patients and providers – at $79 a visit, which is cost-effective compared to in-office visits.
“We’re interested in creating something that helps both the health system to fill that chair, and the patient who doesn’t have to come in and miss work all day for something that ends up not even happening,” Cohen told Webster.
Getting to Scale
The company, which had a $4.6 million funding round in place before the Series A, has been teaming with specialty labs and remains in the early stages of partnering with several health systems as well, forging both a direct-to-consumer and partner-based ecosystem.
Looking ahead, the firm will expand geographically beyond California into Texas, Florida and other states. As the company scales, the duo said, it will look for a subset of the phlebotomist population that is comfortable with technology, with an eye on the fact that certification (to conduct the tests) can vary from state to state. A further goal is to have clusters of patients within cities and towns, which makes the sprinters’ journeys most cost-effective. Eventual payment models will include patient payments (the current model), co-pay and partner pay, said Cohen.
As Behar pointed out, though there has been tremendous growth in the telehealth space, “we know that they’re fundamentally going to be limited by the number of services they can offer with actual hands in the home. We’re hoping to be those kinds of clinical extenders for services like theirs – so they can actually help diagnose an ear infection by looking in your ear. They can actually look in your eyes and get those necessary diagnostics beyond blood draws.”

The VoloDrone in actionVolocopterVIEW 3 IMAGES
Better known for its work developing audacious 18-rotor flying taxis to solve congestion in city centers, Volocopter is adapting its expertise in electric aviation for the purposes of moving heavy cargo. Its giant VoloDrone has now completed its very first public flight, demonstrating how it can safely transport large loads with the help of cargo bikes and play a key role in an all-electric multi-mode delivery system.
Since introducing the VoloDrone in 2019, Volocopter has carried out regular test flights in closed airfields around Germany. Like the Volocopter itself, the giant drone uses 18 rotors, a battery and electric motors to hoist itself into the air, using a rail attachment system in between its landing gear to carry payloads of up to 200 kg (440 lb) over a 40-km (24-mile) range.
On Tuesday, the VoloDrone carried out its first simulated delivery in the public arena, with the exercise undertaken together with logistics firm DB Schenker. This took place as part of ITS World Congress 2021 in Hamburg, and began with the team securing a load to the VoloDrone’s undercarriage.
The aircraft then took off, reaching an altitude of 22 m (72 ft) and carrying the load over a three-minute flight to a nearby carpark, where it came down to land safely. From there, electric cargo bikes were used to transfer the load to its destination beneath a nearby decking.
“This first public VoloDrone flight is a strong sign for Volocopter´s leading position in the UAM (urban air mobility) industry,” says Florian Reuter, CEO of Volocopter. “We are the only UAM company offering solutions for passengers and goods that are flying fully scaled and publicly around the world. Our VoloDrone will make existing logistics processes more robust, efficient, and sustainable. DB Schenker is an invaluable partner in our endeavor to untap the massive potential of our VoloDrone’s logistics use cases.”
As it continues carrying out test flights of the VoloDrone along with its passenger aircraft, Volocopter is working on the infrastructure side of things to support the operations of these vehicles. These could take the shape of so-called VoloPort networks where the vehicles can land, swap batteries and pick up people and cargo. The company says today it is planning to launch these sometime in the next two or three years, though there’ll be regulations and a certification process for it to navigate before a proper lift-off.

A smart city has billions of connected devices and systems. This includes smart street lighting, pedestrian management, road management, waste management, air/noise quality monitoring, smart medical systems etc. Enormous volumes of data will be generated for security, productivity and the quality of life of the citizens. A unified data management framework is imperative for the smooth functioning of a smart city. However, storing and processing such massive amounts of data via the internet will put tremendous pressure on networks and make a dent in the city’s funds. The best solution to this would be to store data locally for easy and immediate access. This is usually done with edge computing.
Understanding Edge Computing
Unlike the standard internet model that relies heavily upon cloud technology services provided by Google, Microsoft, etc., edge computing is a complementary model where the processing of information and its storage is done at the very edge of the network. This means that the information under edge computing is stored as close as possible to the end-points of a network and the devices it is servicing.
This method of processing and storage of data lets organizations render services even when there is no internet connectivity and enabling localized data processing.
Since edge computing makes it possible to develop applications without an internet connection, the installed multiple edge servers will form a network, enabling apps and services to run locally at the edge as opposed to it running on a central cloud platform. As a result, autonomous operations can be performed even when backhaul coverage is lost and lower latency will be required since applications are located nearer to the data source. An open platform will be freely available for third-party developers to develop new applications.
The Need for Edge Computing for Smarter Cities
Smart city development pilots and projects have been replaced with more wide-scale deployments. The concept of a smart city has the IoT (Internet of Things) as a foundation – a network of connected devices offering easy and real-time data exchange for the efficient management of services.
Common examples of IoT deployment include tracking of buses, traffic light and signage management, control of street lighting, refuse monitoring, air quality control, etc.
There are several operational benefits to such deployments. However, too many applications lead to the formation of a large number of data streams, generating the risk of network overloading issues. If these data streams are forced to remain in connection with cloud-based data centres.
The wireless network on which the connectivity of the data sensors depends upon – 5G – is still in a precarious state, even in developed countries. 5G may be the panacea to all network infrastructural problems, but there are only a few widespread commercial deployments of it as of now. There are few proper use cases that justify its costs.
The technology of edge computing can lead not only to operational cost savings but also to an unlimited range of smart apps that can be managed through a single platform, as opposed to siloing it across management devices.
Edge Computing in Everyday Life
Here’s how edge computing technology can improve things in our daily lives:
Street Lights
Smart street lights are growing in popularity, as a result of which there is a rising demand for networking, computing, and storage resources. What smart streetlights need is a highly scalable system that can facilitate easy migration, fast deployment, and high resource utilization. Many cities are replacing their sodium street lights with LED-powered ones. Edge computing provides lighting controls and a means for deploying a universal platform on which other smart apps can also be developed.
Security CCTV Cameras
Today’s smart cameras can be made ‘conscious’ using edge computing to recognize objects and faces. Low-cost and straightforward wireless IP cameras on the market today from which footage can be stored locally in edge for easy and immediate access. This would help save on backhaul costs.
Connected Parking Meters
Edge computing is also being used to deploy smart parking meters, where such systems can be monitored on demand. The data will be transmitted to a central database only in case of a fault, for easy local access.
High-Bandwidth Messaging Services
Edge computing can help provide a high-bandwidth messaging platform that can run without a connection to the internet on standard smartphones and tablets. City workers can use this high-resilient local area network for quick exchange of information.
While smart cities pose a challenge with the vast volumes of data that they will generate and the billions of smart devices that will need to stay connected to each other at all times. Thankfully, edge computing can effectively deal with these problems by offering smooth operation without internet connectivity, enhancing security as the processes are limited to the “edge,” lowering operating costs, and reducing risk with compliances.

If you are looking to expand your sales territory and have not yet put Latin America on your bill of lading, you’re missing a golden opportunity. Latin America offers the fastest-growing regional e-commerce marketplace in the world.
You do not think so? Well, think again. Last year, the total retail e-commerce sales to the LATAM region grew 36.7 percent to $84.95 billion. That is still growing this year.
Among the larger individual economies in the region, Argentina was the fastest growing, with a retail e-commerce increase rate of 79 percent. Brazil’s e-commerce growth rate was 35 percent, while Mexico’s was 27 percent.
“Normally, our holiday rush begins in November. Last year it started in July, and basically never ended,” said A.J. Hernandez, president and CEO of international business-to-consumer shipping firm SkyPostal.
The pandemic increased shipping volumes to Christmas levels in July all over the world as well as throughout Latin America. With the approach of summer, Hernandez sees a continued growth trend as the region works to vaccinate the population.
“I do not believe that there will be a leveling off now that people are more comfortable with online shopping,” he predicted.
Marketing Basics
Hernandez, whose firm is widely recognized as the industry leader in Latin American shipping and delivery logistics, noted that Latin America is, in addition to being a rapidly growing e-commerce market, one of the world’s most complex economic regions.
South America consists of 33 individual countries and an additional 15 dependencies and territories. Populations range in size, with Brazil the largest at 212.6 million people. The Falkland Islands comprise the smallest with just less than 3,500 people.
Most of these countries support their own currencies and have their own taxation and customs authorities. They have their own postal systems, too. But they are widely regarded as unreliable. So you will have to be a bit creative in handling the last mile of delivery.
“U.S.-based companies have to understand the local flavor. The last-mile delivery is key to success. This means partnering with local delivery service providers as well as hiring local leaders,” Ray Wang, a principal analyst at Constellation Research, told the E-Commerce Times.
Latin America has seen the acceleration of digital all across the board. The e-commerce market has seen five years of accelerated transformation in one year, Wang offered about the existing potential for sales growth.
“In Latin America, we have seen innovations in last-mile delivery services, more use of buy online pick up at the curb, and even improvements in payments and apps,” he added.
E-Commerce Market Maker
The pandemic introduced many people to online shopping as it became a necessity. Prior to the pandemic, adoption was not as high in the region as it was in the U.S., Canada, Asia, and Europe, according to Hernandez.
But the pandemic changed the e-commerce landscape considerably in Latin America. The market growth elsewhere as a percentage was not as impressive, since those regions already had higher adoption rates. Yet their volume increases were just as high.
Product offerings are ripe for the picking among Latin American consumers. Many categories of products are globally sought after. Then there are “niche” or hard-to-get items that are not as easy to get as in other markets, Hernandez noted.
That makes an opening that U.S.-based vendors should take. Successful marketers do not need to overdo e-commerce technology. Rather, they should utilize tech to better facilitate the logistical challenges.
For instance, U.S.-based vendors should identify products that are not readily available in the local markets or are very costly. They find a way to make these products available for shoppers supported by a strong logistics network to manage the deliveries, suggested Hernandez.
“Fifty-two million people in that region are expected to make their first online purchase during the pandemic, which could create an increase of up to 30 percent in online consumers in some Latin American countries,” said Hernandez.
What’s more, the Latin American market is expected to grow more than eight percent and reach a market value of $200 billion, he added.
Overcoming Obstacles
U.S.-based marketers and vendors need to be proactive to enter this marketplace. Obstacles do exist but are not insurmountable.
For instance, the number of consumers venturing online to shop lack physical bank accounts. That is a key challenge, remarked Constellation Research’s Wang.
“One opportunity is to leverage the mobile operators who can extend credit on the phone bill or improve sign up of microcredit services,” he offered.
Past issues involving e-commerce for consumers in the Latin America region have long existed, added Hernandez. But a shift in consumer attitudes in starting to improve the damaged online trust factor.
Build Trust or No Sale
Before the pandemic, Latin American consumers fell on the wrong side of the trust barrier. Many feared putting their credit card information online. That also included American citizens reticent to do business with Latin America for fear of credit card fraud.
Covid-19’s arrival shut local stores. Latin American consumers had no choice but to change their trust issues. Now, a new level of confidence is evident that will sustain the region’s growth in e-commerce even after the pandemic has lifted.
“Positive experiences with online shopping have done a lot to erode the underlying mistrust that has always been prevalent in Latin America,” Hernandez said.
Whether it was concern about having a credit card number stolen, or never receiving ordered products, those issues are less of a barrier. Now that Latin American consumers have tried it and found that it works, they trust the process, he added.
Challenges and Technology
The biggest challenge businesses face when expanding to Latin American consumers is that each country has its own set of rules. It is important that businesses work with experts who are familiar with the region to help them avoid the pitfalls that have caused other businesses to fail, recommended Hernandez.
Also, do not sell logistics short. Logistics is as much about delivering data as it is about delivering packages.
Sellers want data. They want to know where their packages are when they are delivered, and if there are any challenges.
“Online visibility is critical, as are data services, to help sellers provide critical information necessary to import goods such as tax ID numbers and HS Codes,” he explained.
In addition, the technology used to correct errors in the initial shipment data and validating postal codes is also critical to success.
Navigating the Shipping and Selling Lanes
The growth in e-commerce and logistical capabilities needed will still require merchants’ keen attentiveness in tapping into the overall Latin American retail economy. To successfully navigate that course, U.S.-based merchants use specialists in Latin American logistics to handle their shipping.
For example, SkyPostal is actually an IT company focused on package delivery. It provides its clients API-based solutions that coordinate their own checkout systems with all the necessary delivery data. The company also offers services in the U.S., Canada, and Europe through partners with similar expertise.
Rather than struggle with setting up a fine-tuned web presence for selling your wares to Latin America’s consumers, consider using an already existing online sales marketplace with built-in selling expertise.
Mercado Libre, known as the “Amazon of Latin America,” has operations in 18 countries throughout the region, is the fourth largest online marketplace in the world, and the largest in Latin America in terms of visits per month. Its top markets are Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico.
Another option for handling localized shipping is ShipStation; which has a partnership with Mercado Libre. That could be a big help to U.S.-based SMBs looking to break into selling to the Latin American marketplace with a package deal.
ShipStation offers shipping software and also has partnerships with more than 300 leading shopping cart, carriers, and fulfillment services. These include FedEx, UPS, the United States Postal Service, Amazon, Shopify, and BigCommerce.

The National Science Foundation (NSF), in partnership with the Department of Energy, has awarded a $1 million Stage 2 Civic Innovation Challenge grant to a team led by A. Russell Chandler III Chair and Professor Pascal Van Hentenryck to pilot an On-Demand Multimodal Transit System (ODMTS) in Atlanta. The goal of the project is to make public transportation in Atlanta faster, more convenient, and more equitable for the city’s residents, especially in underserved communities.
According to Van Hentenryck, who also leads the Socially Aware Mobility Lab, mass transit has a significant first- and last-mile problem: Most people will only walk a quarter of a mile to and from public transportation. If the distance exceeds this threshold, ridership decreases by more than 90%. To address this, Van Hentenryck’s team has created an ODMTS, which uses small on-demand vehicles, in addition to buses and light rail, to take riders to and from their destinations. The on-demand vehicles act as feeders to and from the fixed routes, allowing the transit system to be essentially door-to-door.
Van Hentenryck, a world leader in the fields of artificial intelligence, data science, and operations research, began to tackle the first- and last-mile problems in mobility eight years ago in Canberra, Australia. He then conducted another successful case study in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In both midsized cities, the multi-modal approach resulted in a significant reduction in both cost and passenger wait times. In 2018, Van Hentenryck joined ISyE, shifted his focus to Atlanta, and began a collaboration with the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA). This winter, after more than three years of preparation, the team plans to pilot ODMTS in Atlanta areas with limited public transportation.
While ODMTS will improve the performance and efficiency of public transportation for everyone in Atlanta, the main objective is to provide cost-effective transportation to underserved communities and connect residents in underserved communities to jobs, healthcare, education, and healthy food. The ODMTS pilot will run in MARTA’s four jurisdictions: Clayton, DeKalb, and Fulton counties, and the City of Atlanta.
“It is almost impossible to do this with a traditional system, because these areas are very large and sparsely populated,” said Van Hentenryck. “It is not feasible to put buses in these areas, because they would run empty most of the time, and they require significant capital expenditures. On-demand vehicles, however, are inexpensive to operate and can reach a larger population, because they can be deployed as needed rather than following a set route.”
Though this is not the team’s first pilot, tackling a city like Atlanta is no small feat. Most of the algorithms used in Canberra and Ann Arbor had to be completely rewritten to account for Atlanta’s size and rail system, a component not part of the previous pilots. This creates a four-level system — trains, buses, on-demand vehicles, and walking — to get passengers to and from their locations.
“Atlanta is also a complicated city because it has multiple job centers. In addition to downtown, there are centers in Midtown, Gwinnett, Alpharetta, Buckhead, and near the airport,” said Van Hentenryck. “This makes for a much more complex design since we are taking people from their homes to one of many locations for work.”
Tickets will cost the same as the traditional MARTA system, just $2.50 each way, and riders will be able to purchase fare using the Breeze system. The team is also using a combination of machine learning and optimization techniques to predict rider behavior and ensure the system can scale accordingly.
“If we decrease transit time by 40%, more people will adopt transit because now it is much faster and more convenient than it used to be,” explained Van Hentenryck. “This will increase the demand, so it is important that we size the system correctly to account for this.”
ODMTS will also help decrease traffic congestion in Atlanta and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by enabling more people to use public transportation in place of personal vehicles. The addition of on-demand vehicles will also create jobs since additional drivers will be necessary to operate them. No existing bus routes will be eliminated during the pilot.
Collaboration Leads to Success
“MARTA’s leadership is very forward thinking, and they are working to determine the future of public transportation,” said Van Hentenryck. “They have been extremely collaborative throughout the process and provided us with vast amounts of data and insights to drive the process.”
“We are grateful to the National Science Foundation for this grant and proud to partner with Georgia Tech,” said MARTA Deputy General Manager Collie Greenwood. “Exploring first- and last-mile connectivity options is important in providing transit service that meets the needs of everyone in metro Atlanta.” 
In addition to Van Hentenryck, the Georgia Tech team that will pilot ODMTS in Atlanta includes Professor Subhrajit “Subhro” Guhathakurta in the School of City and Regional Planning, Executive Director for Partnership and Inclusive Innovation Debra Lam, Associate Professor Christopher Le Dantec in the School of Interactive Computing, and Frederick Law Olmsted Associate Professor Kari Watkins in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
The research team will partner directly with residents in pilot communities, as well as with the transportation advocacy organization Atlanta Bicycle Coalition, to ensure transit services and access address the real-world needs of underserved locations.
“Our long history of working directly with Atlanta communities, and with local partners like the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition, will help us embed local expertise into the design of last-mile transit service for under-served locations in the city,” said Le Dantec.
The Stage 2 Civic Innovation Challenge grant is the latest in a series of awards to bring ODMTS to Atlanta. The team received the NSF Leap HI (Leading Engineering for America’s Prosperity, Health, and Infrastructure) grant in 2019 in collaboration with the School of Civil Engineering, School of Urban Planning, MARTA, the Atlanta Regional Commission, and the City of Atlanta to scale the algorithms used in Canberra and Ann Arbor with hopes to eventually pilot the program in Atlanta. They were then awarded a Stage 1 Civic Innovation Challenge planning grant in January 2021 to model the mobility patterns in Atlanta in preparation for a pilot in Stage 2.
“Professor Van Hentenryck deserves much credit for having the foresight to bring multidisciplinary, applied research and external partners together to catalyze innovative responses to regional and urban mobility,” Lam said. “We are excited to explore how this can be modeled for other communities for greater economic and social growth.”
Of the 52 teams selected for Stage 1, only 17 were chosen to move forward with pilot projects in Stage 2. They will have 12 months to complete and evaluate their projects.
“We applaud the efforts of all the teams who worked tirelessly to build partnerships between researchers and community stakeholders” said NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. “We are excited to see the teams selected for the next phase begin their pilot projects and plant seeds of innovation across the country. This program demonstrates the value of research-community partnerships in rapidly translating cutting-edge science into community-based innovation, and we look forward to seeing its positive impact across urban and rural communities.”
Van Hentenryck is eager to implement the pilot. “For me, this is the most successful research that you can have,” he said. “We started more than three years ago with an idea and now we get to make a difference in the lives of people.”

The trusty delivery van may be the most common form of last mile delivery in cities around the world, but its position atop the throne is now being challenged by an unlikely competitor: the humble electric cargo bicycle.
Cargo e-bikes are similar to most electric bicycles in that they feature an assist motor and battery to help the rider travel faster and farther. But unlike most electric bicycles, cargo e-bikes have longer, more robust frames designed to carry significantly larger loads and sometimes even additional passengers.
A new study has found that in urban areas, electric cargo bicycles make deliveries 60% faster than delivery vans.
While delivery vans may be capable of carrying more packages, they are much less efficient at actually making deliveries.
The study found that electric cargo bikes were capable of making 10 deliveries per hour on average in urban areas, while delivery vans recorded just 6 deliveries in the same period.
The major factor was the increased average speed of delivery e-bikes. They were able to utilize bicycle lanes and thus avoid getting bogged down in traffic. Larger delivery vans don’t have the same luxury, ultimately spending much more time waiting in traffic.
The study also found that cargo electric bicycles didn’t just get deliveries done faster, they also performed the job much more cleanly.
Compared to diesel vans, the cargo e-bikes cut emissions by 90%. Even compared to electric vans, cargo e-bikes had 30% fewer emissions.
While electric delivery vans are slowly becoming more commonplace, they still can’t compete with cargo e-bikes on efficiency or emissions.
They’re a huge improvement over fossil fuel-powered vans, but they use more energy to make deliveries and they get bogged down in traffic just the same.
The speed and efficiency advantages of electric cargo bikes have been exploited by a number of industries.
E-bike maker Tern recently teamed up with Dutch-X to combine the latter’s NYC delivery service with the former’s heavy duty electric cargo bikes.
Third party logistics companies such as UPS, FedEx and DHL have employed cargo e-bikes to increase the speed and efficiency of package deliveries in urban areas.
Hospitals have used cargo e-bikes as mini-ambulances to more quickly deliver EMTs and their life-saving first aid to emergency sites.
And cargo e-bikes are even being used by entrepreneurs to operate food trucks and ice-cream vans on smaller, cheaper and more sustainable platforms.
Electrek’s Take
I file this one in the ‘duh’ category.
Cargo e-bikes simply make so much sense. I’ve always had a thing for e-bikes that can carry more than one person, and cargo e-bikes combine that shared fun factor with extreme utility for carrying cargo/groceries/supplies/deliveries/etc.
They have the ability to replace so many types of vehicles.
Think you need a minivan to move apartments? I’ve done it on a cargo e-bike.
Think you need a truck to make a lumber run to your local home improvement store? I’ve done it on a cargo e-bike.
Think you need an SUV to haul all the kids to school? I’ve done it on a cargo e-bike.
Think you need a van to pick up a new bike? Mikey’s done it on a cargo e-bike.
There’s just so much utility to be had with a cargo electric bike. What’s not to like?!

Transportation systems traditionally favour suburban, upwardly mobile users over those from lower-income groups and neighbourhoods.Emerging technology – AI in particular – can help to address this issue.Safe, equitable transportation is within our reach, but we still have a lot of work to do.
Amidst our current reckoning with structural racism, gender bias and unequal access to education and economic opportunity, the transportation industry has a responsibility to acknowledge its own contributions to these inequities. We also have an opportunity to begin to address them – through more considered choices going forward, and, excitingly, with the help of new technology. If these solutions also enhance safety and lower risk for all road users, and if they produce fewer emissions while using our planet’s resources more efficiently, we as a society will have achieved a rare triple-win.
New transit models will democratize safe transportation moving forward. Historically, transit design – and the interstate system in particular – has catered to suburban, upwardly mobile groups, while exacerbating the socioeconomic divide and limiting access to opportunity for those most in need. A recent Harvard studydemonstrated that transportation is the single largest determinant of social mobility. Lack of access can lead to less opportunity, more dependence on (often subpar) public transportation, and longer commute times. Ideally, transit networks should open up a city to all those who live within its proximity, not create mobility and economic hurdles.
Although the link between social mobility and access to transportation is troubling, even more so is how disproportionately low-income communities experience the effects of traffic-related fatalities; for example, those walking in lower-income metropolitan areas have twice the fatality rates of those walking in other neighbourhoods. Transit design in low-income communities is often not optimized for safety to the same extent as in more affluent communities. For instance, low-income communities often lack safe sidewalks and biking infrastructure, while also suffering from higher traffic volumes and higher-speed roadways. This safety disparity costs lives and is one of the most critical problems the transportation industry needs to address: bringing safe mobility to everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status.
Have you read?
When I began exploring autonomous vehicles more than a decade ago as a graduate student at Stanford University, I was excited about the challenges involved. Robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, cars, behavioural economics, psychology and more, all combined into two deep questions: first, how can we solve this incredibly complex technical problem; and second, how can we rethink transportation in cities if people don’t have to drive their own cars?
As I learned more about the needs of people in cities, another topic surfaced, too: the extent of the discrepancy in people’s ability to get from point A to point B. In aggregate, taxi drivers (of all races) preferentially pick up white passengers. Residents of underserved communities often have to spend hours commuting on multiple bus routes or biking along streets with cars zipping by at more than 40 miles per hour. Sometimes there are no sidewalks.
These hurdles make people’s lives harder. Through this lens, developing autonomous vehicles is even more than an exciting technical, economic, safety and environmental challenge; it’s a people issue, too. How can we find ways for everyone – regardless of their socioeconomic status or where they live in a city – to safely and efficiently go where they want?

Often when confronted with massive societal-level problems like these, we turn to the government for answers or solutions. No doubt, they have a critical role to play in almost all pieces of the puzzle. But changing laws, societal norms, and decades-old programmes can take a long time at best, and sometimes there are so many stakeholders, different opinions, and inability (or unwillingness) to pay, that genuine change feels out of reach. So it’s exciting when new technologies and associated business models emerge that can play a part in solving the hardest problems.
AI comes with its own challenges – but it absolutely can and will play a role in bringing safe, clean, and affordable transportation models to our roadways. Most public transit systems require significant capital investments in infrastructure and are typically designed to accommodate the greatest need (which, itself, is subject to opinion and bias). The challenge, then, is that services like trains and bus lines are restricted to just the number of stops and areas they can serve. As a city grows and evolves, the public transit systems often remain the same – becoming inaccessible to those who rely on it the most.
Amidst the rigidity of public transportation, we have the so-called last-mile problem: a situation where travelers are often not able to reach their exact destination, but are able to get within a few miles or so. Taxis, ridehailing, scooters, biking and walking are all possible solutions, but there can be financial, safety, or practical barriers associated with these. Many individuals purchase a car specifically to avoid public transportation, or don’t have access to it in the first place.

Demand for mobility-as-a-service has grown steadily over the past decade, especially in cities. This model brings many benefits, and at its best, can be genuinely complimentary to public transportation – but it has also left some people behind. Traditional ridehailing services can be unpredictable, especially with surge pricing and the recent shortage of drivers.
While modern-day ridehailing services have partially democratized the personal chauffeur, there are overhead costs that are passed on to the riders: for example, the expenses to pay drivers a living wage or the cost to cover deadheading (the term for when a vehicle is underutilized and drives around without charging for its miles). And while most drivers are safe and courteous with clean and well-maintained vehicles, unfortunately, that’s not always the case.MOBILITY
What is the World Economic Forum doing about mobility?
Show
With new technologies, we can build a more affordable and inclusive transportation system for even more of our communities. Our vehicles will be meaningfully safer than their human-driven counterparts. Over time, they will cost much less to use. They’ll create less pollution and use fewer resources, because they’re utilized all day and night long. Within their geofence, they won’t discriminate based on race or socioeconomic status. They’ll be reliably clean and well maintained. And they’ll be a pleasure to ride in, having been designed for exactly that.
The potential societal benefits are tremendous, but we still have a long and capital-intensive road ahead. Along this journey, there will be challenges; we certainly won’t solve everything for everyone right away. But we couldn’t be more excited to help address some of society’s oldest issues by dismantling historic transportation hurdles and bringing safe, clean and enjoyable transportation to everyone.

The American public transit system seems to be in shambles. Citizens have steadily abandoned public transport in favour of private vehicles. An ongoing debate about the state of public transport cites numerous factors, including lack of funds. However, it is not just the government that is to be blamed for the decline in the usage of public transport.
The State of the American Public Transit System
Several means of public transport exist in US cities like Washington DC, New York City, Boston, Seattle Chicago, and San Francisco. While cities like Houston has an excellent public transport system,  many places suffer from traffic congestion problems because there are no mass transit solutions.
Since 2012, public transport ridership has increased in New York but has declined in many other cities. The major reason is that mass transit systems are plagued with safety and operational problems. Passengers getting held up because of trains breaking down is no longer something out of the ordinary.  Moreover, places like the New York subway stations have noticed an increase in passenger violence and theft.
To understand the declining state of the American public transit system, one needs to look into how public transport systems were maintained by the government in the past.
At the turn of the 20th century, once private automobiles became popular, instead of improving services to stay competitive, the U.S transit agency downgraded service to cut costs.
This neglect drove away many riders, creating a notion that public transport is a welfare system for those who cannot afford to drive. This notion created a vicious cycle where only those who couldn’t afford private vehicles used public transport and the government offered minimal funds for maintenance.
The downside to viewing public transport as a welfare system is that it prevents the system from charging a fee high enough to provide efficient service. Moreover, American citizens prioritize trains and buses with higher reach over frequency. They want the American public transit system to cater to every block, instead of fewer trains which arrive frequently.
However, those who understand public transport agree that it is better to have fewer lines with frequent trains instead of many trains which leave once every few hours.
What Other Cities Got Right About Public Transit
Canada is geographically spread out just like the US but still manages to have a well-functioning public transport system in its major cities. This is because Canadian policymakers believe in having a transport system which focuses on frequency rather than reach and invest funds accordingly.
The fundamental difference between the transit in European and American cities is the infrastructure of the transport. Post the Second World War, automobiles became a symbol of reconstruction. Europe developed elaborate plans to diminish historic neighbourhoods to make way for wider roads and parking spaces.
The US did the same, but the difference was that European suburbs were designed in a way that made transit use viable whereas the early US suburbs like New York were built along highways and had an underdeveloped transit service.
The primary idea differentiating transit systems in the US from other countries in the developed world is the amount of importance and attention given to public transportation. If viewed as a welfare system, public transport will continue to be deprived of adequate funds for maintenance.
Public transport reduces carbon gas emissions and consumption of fuel, making it great for the environment. With a burgeoning population, public transport also tackles the problem of limited parking spaces.
Being the largest economy in the world, the US will have to invest in improving the public transport system for its citizens.

Bike share equity remains an uphill battle in impoverished neighborhoods and communities populated primarily by low-income residents and people of color. However, neither catering to affluent, white men nor community apathy and indifference are necessarily to blame. The reasons are complicated, but progress is happening, and more inroads are on the horizon.
Bike sharing is a communal transportation service in which bikes are made available for short-term use. Typically, the bikes are picked up at one location and returned to another. The average fee, according to ScienceDirect, can be about $4.29 for a two-hour trip, but fees vary depending on the operator, the amount of use time, and the city. A two-hour ride in Washington D.C., for example, may cost $10 or more, according to Moneycrashers.
A movement is born
The fluctuating costs, variables like late turn-in fees, and the tendency for bike share systems to be located in more affluent communities or near tourist attractions, has pegged these services as a recreational amenity for the privileged. There is now an intentional movement to diversify and reframe bike share programs as a public transit service for everyone.
“It is important to be able to access essential services — to travel to a grocery store, a COVID vaccination site, school, or work. If you don’t have transportation, if you don’t have access to a reliable bus system or a car because you cannot afford it, you’re limited in your work, school or life options,” says Kiran Herbert, local program writer and content manager for PeopleforBikes, and a founding partner of Better Bike Share Partnership (BBSP).
BBSP is a collaboration that funds bike-equity initiatives in low-income and BIPOC communities. Since 2015, BBSP has funded 76 grants, totaling over $1.5 million, according to Herbert.
“Bike shares allow for mobility and freedom to participate in our society, and live a life you choose,” she continued.
Herbert was referring to making bike share systems accessible in all neighborhoods, particularly those areas where bike-share options can enhance or fill in public transit gaps. However, bike share equity exceeds operators actively placing bike share systems in underserved neighborhoods; access also includes affordability
The Detroit Solution
In Detroit, the MoGo Bike Share System offers a discounted access pass for low-income riders. The access pass is an annual membership that allows riders year-long, daily bike usage. The cost for people who receive some type of childcare or public assistance is $5 for the entire year. The usual fee is $95.
“We really didn’t want the price for bike share to be a barrier for anyone who needed transportation or even just to run errands, especially in a city like Detroit where so many people don’t have access to cars or maybe cannot afford other forms of transportation,” said Adriel Thornton, MoGo’s executive director.
Other cities, like Chicago and Philadelphia, offer similarly discounted annual passes and cash payment options in addition to credit or debit cards.
To increase accessibility, MoGo at one time partnered with CVS, Family Dollar and 7-Eleven stores, where people who lacked credit or debit cards could pay cash to purchase annual memberships. When that option ended, MoGo began accepting cash for certain bike share services utilizing Cash App.
In 2018, MoGo collaborated with the Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT) to offer MoGo memberships to individuals who were already purchasing weekly, biweekly, or monthly bus passes. Ninety percent of people using the DDOTXMoGo pass were non-white and used the pass to get to and from work, and to connect to public transportation. Eighty-one percent had an income of less than $25,000 per year. MoGo hopes to expand upon this pilot by providing free transfers between bike share and transit, reducing the transportation costs for single trips.
Funding for equity
To cover the cost of equity programs, bike share operators are often helped by city and foundation funding from organizations like BBSP. Nathan McNeil, research associate at Portland State University’s Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning, wonders what will happen when those funds run out.
“A lot of the equity programs depend on small pots of money here and there. They are rarely built into the long-term funding streams of the system. Bike share isn’t like transit, in that we don’t tend to have large subsidies or taxes that go toward supporting it. That needs to change if bike share is going to become a substantial part of these communities and cities in general,” McNeil said.
While McNeil’s concern may be valid, Noa Banayan, director of federal affairs for PeopleForBikes, is optimistic. “Bike share and micro-mobility are new at a federal level. That’s allowed it some flexibility in terms of how funding moves to the states, cities and towns,” Banayan said. Greater flexibility increases the categories, such as carbon reduction, transit and equity, through which bike-share programs can qualify for funding.
“Congress is set to pass a five-year funding bill called Connecting America’s Active Transportation Act. In addition to prioritizing funding for marginalized communities, the bill — if passed — will increase support for networked bike lanes and supportive infrastructure,” Banayan continued.
Infrastructure improvements needed
While affordability has been one challenge for underserved communities, the physical condition of city infrastructure in disinvested neighborhoods is another. Streets and sidewalks may be in disrepair, bike lanes and signage may not be available, and some neighborhoods are often sandwiched between major roads and highways, which present challenges for residents who want to ride, but fear for their safety.
“There are things that have been unequitable about transportation that bleed into bike share,” says Hebert. “We build highways through a lot of these neighborhoods, which make it really hard to put in bike lanes and [make it] dangerous to bike at all. . . . We know that traffic violence is also higher in those neighborhoods, so all those factors have kind of made it so that bike shares are concentrated in areas with those who already have the most privilege,” Herbert said.
Yalinette Rivera works as a team leader for Chicago-based Northwest Side Housing Center (NWSHC), which services the middle-to-working class, predominantly Latino Belmont-Cragin neighborhood. She agrees traffic violence can dissuade people from biking.
“I actually got into an incident where I was riding between a moving car on one side, and a parked car on the other. When the driver unexpectedly merged where I was riding, I collided with the parked car. I’ll just be upfront, I haven’t had a good experience biking in the area since then,” Rivera said.
She says she  primarily takes buses now, but looks forward to the addition of bike lanes in her community sometime in July. “I see a lot of youth and elderly people using bikes as transportation. They need to be able to move around safely,” Rivera said.
According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), 843 bicyclists were killed in car crashes with motor vehicles in 2019. To prevent traffic violence or accidents, marginalized communities need bike-friendly and traffic-calming infrastructure, like updated signage, decreased speed limits, narrower car lanes, curb extensions, and networked bike lanes and circuits that connect riders to transit depots, schools, stores, and other routine destinations — sometimes without ever having to share the road with cars.
The City of Philadelphia currently has 200 miles of bike lanes and 360 miles of circuit trails for urban and suburban bike transit, and is developing a citywide network of bike-friendly streets as a part of a comprehensive, $3.7 million federally funded program. The linked lanes and circuits will also promote safer passages for bicyclists. One-third of the city’s bike share systems are in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, according to McNeil.
What the numbers tell us
In 2017, McNeil surveyed communities of color in Chicago’s Bronzeville and New York City’s Bed Stuy neighborhoods to gauge their interest in bike share programs. Bike shares had been negatively associated with neighborhood gentrification, inability to afford cars, and other inaccuracies. The survey showed 73 percent of the respondents were not concerned about those things at all and saw a need for bike share programs.
To combat misinformation, bike-share equity programs often utilize bike-share ambassadors — people who mirror their constituents — to make others aware of what bike shares are and how to use them. Working with bike-share operators, these programs often set up bike rides so first-time riders can experience the service firsthand, often free of charge.
As for Chicago’s Belmont-Cragin neighborhood, where over 27,000 young people under the age of 18 reside, they welcome bike-share programs.
“We have no El station in our community. The El doesn’t go west enough, so we are a 15-minute bus ride from the El to Belmont-Cragin. We’re left without transit options for our young folks. Biking and scooters have become the primary mode of transit,” says NWSHC executive director James Rudyk.
In 2018, the NWSHC surveyed area youth to identify issues affecting the neighborhood.
Lack of public transportation options and biking infrastructure were major concerns. The community currently has no bike-share systems, but as a result of a youth-led advocacy, they have worked with the Chicago Department of Transportation, Active Transportation Alliance (a nonprofit that advocates for bike safety), various city aldermen, Divvy Bike Share System, and BBSP to achieve some major transportation goals.
Equitable outcomes
By the end of July, the city plans to add five miles of bike lanes. Through BBSP’s Living Lab funding initiative, NWSHC will also purchase 100 Divvy for Everyone, $5-discounted annual membership passes, so residents will be able to afford to participate in the bike share when the bike stations are available.
NWSHC has also been pegged by Divvy to pilot a program that streamlines a stringent verification process from detailed paperwork and online submissions, to signing a waiver and purchasing the pass, according to Jose Cuebas, a NWSHC youth organizer.
Regarding local access to Chicago’s Divvy Bike Share System, Cuebas said,
“I don’t know why they didn’t put Divvys on the northwest side or the south side until last year. Maybe they don’t see the ridership among people [there], but that’s simply not true. We see people riding bikes every day. We see kids riding their bikes and others riding to work or riding to school, so we need options as well.”

The continent of Europe has been making strides in harnessing smart technologies alongside implementing traffic regulations to improve urban mobility. A Sustainable Mobility Report published in March 2020 by the European Cyclists’ Federation (ECF) concluded that France has the most effective off-street parking regulations in all of Europe. The report titled ‘Making Buildings Fit for Sustainable Mobility’ came to this conclusion after investigating a total of 56 off-street parking regulations for both cars and bicycles across 31 European cities.
Sustainable Mobility Report
The report also stated that France is the only country in Europe to have implemented maximum car parking norms as opposed to minimum parking requirements. They achieved this by restricting the number of car parking slots that can be built per housing unit. The ECF found that a theory that has gained merit in academic research circles is, that minimum availability of car parking promotes vehicular ownership and its use. Households own and use more cars and evade public transport if there is ample access to off-street parking.
Minimum parking requirements (MPRs) lead to an over-supply of parking spaces that negatively impact living costs and construction costs. Minimum car parking impositions have turned out to be detrimental to sustainable mobility.
Other than France, the cities of Berlin in Germany and Tyrol in Austria were found to have the most effective and sustainable parking legislations regionally. Whereas, Hungary, Lithuania, Slovenia, and The Netherlands stood out for providing citizens with sustainable parking solutions and facilities on a national level.
Sustainable parking practices encourage more efficient use of parking space in areas where mobility is problematic. These practices also include technology-driven solutions like ride-hailing, ride-sharing, smart parking, etc. to reduce demand for parking.
Since after this report was published, the ECF has been insisting that all national and local authorities in Europe impose a similar maximum parking policy instead of minimum parking restrictions (MPRs) and the corresponding mobility management services.
ECF’s senior policy officer who is also the report’s lead author declared that there is a need to make buildings more sustainable in terms of mobility and energy-efficiency. Doing away with minimum car parking regulations and installing maximum car limits is critical for delivering on the aforementioned objectives.
In Conclusion 
It can be said without a shred of doubt that a lot can be learned by the examples in parking regulations set by France. Furthermore, The ECF report is a first of its kind attempt at rigorously collecting, contrasting and ranking parking norms across Europe. Findings from this report will feed into making our surroundings more sustainable.

The Re:Move electric cargo mover prototype in actionPolestarVIEW 4 IMAGES
Earlier this year, Volvo-owned Polestar signaled its intentions to move beyond electric cars and into other forms of clean transport, introducing an electric transporter concept for carrying goods around urban areas. The company has now turned up to IAA 2021 in Germany with a fully-functioning prototype, which carries with it a few new details around how a production version of the so-called urban “sled” will work.
The Re:Move electric cargo mover concept was first revealed back in March and featured a highly practical flatbed design just begging to be loaded up with boxes, bags or other cargo. While originally listed as 600 lb (275 kg), the payload capacity has now been pared back to 396 lb (180 kg), though the Re:Move maintains a slim profile designed to suit most bike lanes, measuring just 750 mm (30 in) across.
Made from recyclable aluminum, the Re:Move’s chassis is fitted with an electric tilting mechanism to lean into corners and allow for a tight turning circle of less than 7 m (23 ft). A damped rear swing arm should make the ride a little less jarring for the people and items onboard, and disc brakes also feature for greater stopping power.
A 2.2-kWh battery pack powers the whole operation, with the Re:Move limited to a maximum speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph) in line with the electric bicycle laws of many jurisdictions. Always-on front lighting, brake lights, a horn and optional indicators are also onboard for the purposes of safety.
The Re:Move is the result of a collaboration between Polestar, e-bike-maker Cake, aluminum manufacturer Hydro, Wallpaper magazine, and industrial designer Konstantin Grcic. There are no figures offered on range at this point, nor on price or availability, but the designers are positioning the Re:Move as a cleaner alternative to delivery vans in cities, or even as a cargo transportation solution in rural areas.
“The passion and expertise our partners have brought to this project shows the power of great design,” says Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar CEO. “Electrifying vehicles is the start point, not the end game. Our engineers have proven that this kind of open collaboration will accelerate innovation and the shift to truly sustainable mobility.”

The last mile’s always there, always a challenge, always urgent – and never more so than when eCommerce explodes.
The prime mover advantage, of course, goes to the “King Kong” of eCommerce, which would be Amazon. You’ve likely experienced the compressed delivery times Amazon has been able to offer – what used to be two days’ delivery is now one – and in some cases, you can get what you want in a matter of hours.
A slew of other companies, across a slew of other verticals, have been pushing through their own innovative last-mile efforts to satisfy customers’ expectations, honed by the “Amazon effect,” that they can get what we want, pretty much when they want.
Amazon, of course, has not in any way been resting on logistics laurels. The firm has been extending its fulfillment footprint by leaps and bounds. As detailed by CFO Brian Olsavsky on its earnings call, the firm has increased its capacity by 50 percent through Amazon Logistics.
Logistics, he said, has been “a large area of investment – not only fulfillment centers, but also two elements of transportation, what we call the middle mile, where we’re putting sort centers, Amazon Air, line haul, trailers … think of all the intermediate movements between our warehouses and our final delivery stations.” The last mile includes the delivery service network, where “we see … the ability to control the whole flow of products from the warehouse to the end customer.” A majority of units, the company has said, are flowing through Amazon Logistics.
Groceries And Retail, By Air  
In the bid to modernize, streamline and speed delivery, we’re seeing efforts by other large, mainstream retailers to use high tech to gain an edge in reaching the customer at the doorstep across novel means.
As has been announced this month, Kroger and Drone Express have entered a pilot program to offer grocery delivery by drone in the Midwestern U.S. In terms of mechanics, package delivery is made to the location of a customer’s smartphone, not simply a street address, in some cases within a quarter of an hour. The company is providing bundled offerings such as baby care, or a “s’mores” bundle (with the ingredients for that particular snack). Walmart has had its own drone program in place, as reported in this space earlier in the year.
None of this is to say that more traditional players have been sitting still. FedEx late last year bought ShopRunner, an eCommerce platform, to shore up its eCommerce presence. That platform, the firms said upon news of the deal, connects millions of consumers to more than 100 brands with free two-day shipping and free returns.
(And, of course, delivery aggregators are still cementing their own presence with restaurants and other merchants.)
It would make sense that smaller enterprises would want to gain the scale and efficiencies that their larger brethren enjoy. And in another example, Shopify’s management said on the conference call with analysts that demand for its own fulfillment efforts has been strong. Shopify Shipping, according to management, said that its volume in the first quarter was roughly the same as the fourth quarter. The fulfillment network, the company has said, is geared toward firms that sell in the U.S. and have fewer than 200 SKUs. Those fulfillment centers pick, pack and ship products on behalf of the smaller merchants.
As the digital shift continues, it seems, there are many paths toward transforming the last mile.

 With public and private partners, Pittsburgh’s city government is the first in the country to launch a digital system coordinating local transit options. It represents the local entrance to an international sustainability-minded movement. 
 By Sophie Burkholder / STAFF 
Pittsburgh will soon be a national leader in mobility tech.
Earlier this month, the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure launched a two-year initiative called Move PGH, a comprehensive program convening private and public transportation options both physical and online to help Pittsburghers get where they need to go. Partners of the program include electric scooter rental company Spin, moped rental company Scoobi, local bike share system Healthy Ride, Waze Carpool and Transit, among others.
Move PGH centers around a robust app, powered by Transit, and 50 new physical mobility hubs across the city. While Transit has operated its services in Pittsburgh since 2013 and currently has over 40,000 users in the area, this new and improved digital hub will add even more transportation options to its current offerings.
Citing the recent growth of car ridesharing as well as shared bike and scooter systems, Move PGH underscores the need for a central place to find availability and pricing across all transportation options. Though Pittsburgh has been ranked as having the 15th best public transit system in the country and currently has 134,717 workers living within a half mile of transit, Port Authority has actually cut several services and routes over the last decade and saw sharp revenue drops during the pandemic.
Those cuts, paired with Pittsburgh’s hilly topography that can make walking or biking more difficult, mean that the 20% of residents without a car still struggle to get to work, the grocery store or other essential destinations. Transportation problems are inherently equity ones too, as over 65% of Pittsburgh’s low-income households don’t have access to a private car according to Move PGH.
One solution that’s gained popularity in recent years is what’s called Mobility as a Service, aka MaaS, which is the use of a digital platform to allows passengers to plan and pay for transportation across a wide range of public and private options. Such services could eventually make individual vehicle ownership obsolete.
“Mobility as a Service, ultimately, is about making sure people have access to the transportation services that can help them get around, easily, affordably, sustainably, when they need them,” said Transit Communications Lead Stephen Miller. “And so the City of Pittsburgh’s approach here was to really look at Mobility as a Service as a way to get these private companies and the public services that are available to really connect together and make sure that people in Pittsburgh have a way to access all of these together, rather than everybody kind of doing their own thing.”
While already a popular approach in Europe — with Helsinki planning to eliminate the need for personal cars by 2025 — Pittsburgh is the first city to adopt this approach in the United States. But Miller wasn’t surprised to see the local community pioneer this program. Unlike larger cities that often have a variety of extensive public transportation options, midsize cities like Pittsburgh have become more dominated by cars, giving local governments more urgency in connecting residents to alternative choices.
“It’s really forced a lot of cities and transit agencies in these types of midsize cities to think really creatively about how they can improve their services, and how they can be really thoughtful and creative about shifting trips to more sustainable options,” Miller said.
There are unique technical considerations as Mobility as a Service becomes widespread. A growing standard used in the field is the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), which several public transportation options, including Port Authority, have adopted as a way to share information with navigation apps like Transit or Google Maps. Meanwhile, many bikeshare companies use General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) while ride-hailing and taxi companies use General On-Demand Feed Specification (GOFS).
These differences aren’t a problem, Miller said: “Because each mode of transportation has different needs, it makes total sense that there would be different data standards for transit, scooters/bikeshare, and on-demand services.”
“Ultimately, all of these mobility pieces should be able to speak the same language and connect together so people can easily make these trips.”STEPHEN MILLER, TRANSIT
But there’s a challenge in making sure these standards are adopted broadly within the transportation field.
“Ultimately, all of these mobility pieces should be able to speak the same language and connect together so people can easily make these trips,” he said.
Beyond making transportation more accessible to residents, Mobility as a Service has the potential to significantly reduce emissions — a critical and persistent issue for Pittsburgh, which the American Lung Association recently ranked as the ninth worst city in the country for air quality.
Part of those pollution issues are undoubtedly associated with the heavy use of cars here. A September 2019 report from mobility analytics company INRIX showed that 23% of car trips in Pittsburgh were less than one mile, while 50% were less than three miles.
Miller sees Move PGH and future work in Mobility as a Service as a way of resolving that classic last-mile problem in transportation.
“Those are distances that are easily covered by either walking or biking or electric scooters or public transit,” he said. “And so making sure that we build up these options and make them easy enough to access for people so they’re not just grabbing the car keys to go a mile down the road is really important to shifting those trips to more sustainable modes.”

With a near monopoly on delivery, Amazon is understandably keen to make the job easier. The latest idea that may or may not eventually see the light of day is a new patent for a system where delivery vans would carry items almost to their destination, then send out and direct ground drones to do the final drop-off.
Amazon and other companies like UPS are already experimenting with drones that fly or drive to deliver everything from packages to pizza to medicine. But the humble delivery van doesn’t need to worry about being rendered redundant just yet – it turns out that drones are terribly inefficient on their own.
So in the new patent, Amazon describes how it would pair them with delivery vans to make both more efficient. First, a “primary vehicle” (read a van, truck, car etc) would be loaded up with items to be delivered, as well as secondary vehicles – either flying drones, small ground vehicles, or both. The idea is that the van would drive to the destination, park in the street, then send the smaller vehicle to drop the parcel at the doorstep or wherever it needs to go.
But here’s the clever bit – rather than load out each drone with its own sensors and pathfinding hardware, that can be outsourced to equipment back in the van. Cameras, radar, sonar, LiDAR, or other location sensors can analyze the best path for the drone to take, then beam the instructions to it wirelessly over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or the like.
The secondary vehicle could be equipped with some kind of marking, like a QR code or a logo, that the van’s camera can track as the drone moves around. If need be, it can then recalculate new paths or speeds to help the drone get around obstacles. After the drop-off has been made, the van can then instruct the drone on how to get back.
As with most patents, there are plenty of variations on this general scenario – the primary vehicle could be a van, truck, car, etc, and either autonomous or driven by humans. The secondary drone could crawl along on wheels or have legs like a Boston Dynamics robot, and may or may not have its own sensors. Entire fleets of these robots could service a neighborhood under the watchful eye of a single van.
Also like most patents, there’s no guarantee this system will ever actually get off the ground. But Amazon and other companies always want to be patenting new innovations, no matter how pie-in-the-sky, if just to keep the competition from stealing the best ideas. If everything in Amazon’s imagined patented future were to come to pass, we might have drones launching from airships, trains and huge hives, recharging at lamp posts, and dropping parcels with parachutes.

There are many data sets available to fleet managers, so implementing some best practices will help you maximize the functionality of your telematics systems and engage in useful data management.
Telematics can provide incredible insights to fleet managers about the productivity and safety of their drivers and fleet.
Furthermore, telematics systems that incorporate machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) can even help fleet managers predict potential issues to make impactful business decisions.
There are many data sets available to fleet managers, so implementing some best practices will help you maximize the functionality of your telematics systems and engage in useful data management.
Here are some dos and don’ts of telematics to help fleet managers stay on the right track.
DO
Implement a driver coaching systemThe data gathered from telematics systems illustrates certain modifications that could improve driver behavior. Implementing these modifications will result in a reduction of losses and increased safety on the roads.
A driver coaching program is both a written and verbal safety policy that clearly states driver expectations and performance. Encourage consistent communication with employees and establish a system for employees to provide feedback, address concerns or get their questions answered in a swift and easy manner.
Master the system you’re usingThe best way to get the most out of your telematics system is to take the time to learn it.
You may uncover beneficial use-cases for your particular industry that you may not have without knowing the full capabilities. Lean on your telematics provider’s training resources.
They should have an extensive learning/help center and provide role-based training sessions and courses so that your drivers and admins only need to learn what matters to their day-to-day use of the platform.
These courses can be offered live online or recorded for on-demand use. Take the time to learn your telematics program and about the various metrics you can measure and leverage.
Clearly define and communicate the key metrics that you want to trackPay attention to details but avoid obsessing over each tiny data point.
Telematics can provide fleet managers with a great deal of data, so it’s imperative to have goals and an overall operational plan. This could include benchmarks in driver productivity and efficiency, safety, fleet maintenance and any other business-related goals.
By spotlighting data that makes sense for your relevant objectives, it will allow you to adjust and make decisions that move the needle in a meaningful way for your set criteria.
Further to this point, be intentional with your internal communication plan and be transparent in sharing with employees which key performance indicators will be measured when they are hired. Have managers and team leads set clear expectations upfront regarding productivity and safety.
Fleet managers can garner driver buy-in for safety coaching programs and performance feedback reviews by consistently communicating with employees and establishing an efficient and easy system for employees to provide feedback, address concerns and have questions answered.
Another communication approach would be to start small and only focus on the most impactful metrics at first. Initially tracking only important data points— such as idling rates, delivery times and basic driving behaviors — can prevent drivers from feeling overwhelmed and heavily monitored when adopting a new telematics system, and fleet managers can always expand upon the initial list of tracked metrics as time goes on.
DON’T
Rely on telematics as the only way to evaluate employees and identify bad driversYes, it is important to carefully analyze the collected data, but do not use this as thesole form of driver evaluation. This could lead to distrust between managers and employees.
There may have been extenuating circumstances, such as traffic delays or road accidents, that caused a reduction in driver efficiency, so make sure to review the entire situation before labeling someone as a bad driver.
As discussed in the “dos,” a holistic approach to employee evaluation is rooted in open communication. By having conversations with customers, coworkers and – most importantly – the driver in question, you will gain a more accurate representation of an employee’s performance.
Be hard on employees when adopting your telematics softwareIt is natural for employees to be resistant or feel overwhelmed when a company implements new technologies.
Do not expect employees to embrace the system immediately. Give them time to feel it out, which will in time improve their overall performance. You also do not want to hide any information from employees. Instead, implement a user-friendly system and capitalize on transparency with employees. Hiding important information or eluding arduous questions will not lead to desired driver results.

 Integrating on-demand microtransit options into existing services allows agencies to better serve communities with affordable, convenient public transit, promoting economic mobility. 
By Kellie Meilleur
Nearly 70 percent of all Americans who depend on the bus for their transportation needs make less than $50,000 per year. This, according to a report by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), validates that lower-income individuals rely more heavily on public transportation than those who are earn higher incomes. 
Across the nation, more and more transit agencies and cities are turning to on-demand microtransit service to expand and improve public transportation options for low-income residents. 
What exactly is microtransit? Simply, microtransit is dynamic routing. It takes mobile smartphone apps and puts them to use to create an efficient mode of transport that adapts with each passenger’s trip needs. At the click of a button, passengers can book a trip that will take them on the quickest route to their desired destination.  
A distinctive aspect of microtransit, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, is that it is “a privately owned and operated shared transportation system that can offer fixed routes and schedules, as well as flexible routes and on-demand scheduling. The vehicles generally include vans and buses.” 
Microtransit can be easily accessible and highly efficient anda ‘no-brainer’ for many lower income individuals who can’t afford to own a car and have therefore been greatly underserved by traditional transit networks.
When COVID-19 first hit, a majority of higher income earners began working from home and using their personal vehicles for necessary travel. On the far end of the spectrum, millions of lower-income Americans didn’t have the same luxury or opportunity. They needed to get to and from their jobs and other destinations, despite sweeping changes in how transportation options had changed and disadvantaged many since the pandemic.  
That’s where microtransit in its many forms came into play, and in a big way. 
Many transit agencies, anxious to serve their most underserved customers and plug the gap between traditional fixed-route transportation and more individual transportation options, are offering riders fast and convenient ways to book their trips.  
Microtransit has proven to be a mobility lifeline. Amid the many shutdowns we have all experienced, on-demand transit has pivoted to serve specific community needs, such as food delivery to our most vulnerable community members and transporting hospital and other frontline workers to their jobs, even in the overnight hours. In fact, APTA’s data shows that dynamic, on-demand public transit has proven to be a mobility lifeline for those in low-income areas during this crisis.
Transit industry expert, thought leader and influencer Paul Comfort recently hosted a podcast segment on his show, Comfort’s Corner, about the role of microtransit for equity and inclusion. As a thought leader in the public transportation space, Comfort sees public transportation’s role as one to improve equity and inclusion for those who need it most.First, it was for the elderly and those with mobility challenges, and now, it’s for those who are underserved.
Comfort believes that microtransit is the hottest trend to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. When the pandemic hit, transportation providers made major changes to their service based on changing ridership demand and to adhere to health and safety requirements. This included altering transit routes and changing the frequency of trips. These changes immediately impacted those who had no other means of getting from point A to point B. The silver lining is that microtransit has been the solution to the transit shortage problem. Comfort explains that “microtransit fills the transit gaps, and it ensures that no one gets left behind.”  
The great news is that the stop-gap solution that microtransit provides is here to stay. Significant data across several U.S. cities has recently been gathered suggesting that microtransit has been a vital public resource for lower-income individuals since the start of the pandemic. This information, along with insights shared by transit thought leaders like Comfort, help the transportation industry to look ahead to the long-term need for microtransit as part of the equity and inclusion solution. 
By joining the microtransit movement and integrating on-demand options into existing public transit infrastructure, transit providers across the country can better serve their communities with affordable, convenient public transportation and promote economic mobility for all.

 Pittsburgh is a hub for AV development, and local companies are keeping sustainability in mind. But researchers and city officials still have concerns about the disruptive technology’s unknowns. 
By Sophie Burkholder
Though political fights and Tesla have pushed electric vehicles to the forefront of automobile industry news this year, one of Pittsburgh’s leading tech sectors could also be a key player in making transportation more sustainable than ever before.
Autonomous vehicles have a long history in Pittsburgh, starting with Carnegie Mellon University’s winning team in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. Since then, several companies in the sector have built their headquarters here, continually bringing jobs, wealth and engineering prowess to the area. Pittsburgh, for its part, has welcomed the new technology, starting with Mayor Bill Peduto’s early work in allowing Uber to test its initial fleet of autonomous cars.
While a full commercial launch of the technology is still yet to come, recent announcements from two area companies indicate that momentum is building. But for all of the new convenience and efficiency these cars might offer, their environmental advantages are somewhat more nuanced than those of electric vehicles, leaving some to wonder how they will operate in a world that is de-emphasizing the trend of automobile transportation in the name of climate change.
Pittsburgh pollution
The main environmental benefit that autonomous vehicles offer is their efficiency: “Autonomous vehicles, in general, operate more optimally,” Neil Donahue, the director of CMU’s Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education and Research told Technical.ly. “They’re less lead-footy.”
More efficient driving means more efficient fuel usage, which should reduce vehicle emissions. That should mean cars will have less wear and tear over time and last longer, reducing both physical and energy waste that can come from automobile manufacturing. While Donahue acknowledged that the reductions would be less immediate than those seen with a switch to electric cars, he noted that even a small change can make a major difference to the region’s air quality.
“Autonomous vehicles, in general, operate more optimally. They’re less lead-footy.”NEIL DONAHUE, STEINBRENNER INSTITUTE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
A research publication from June of last year led by CMU Associate Research Professor in Mechanical Engineering Albert Presto showed just how much local traffic emissions contribute to air pollution in Pittsburgh. He and his coauthors found that during the morning rush hour period after stay-at-home orders were put in place last spring, carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide levels decreased by about 50% — which was also the approximate percent decrease in traffic levels during that time. Notably, other major polluters in the area like the U.S. Steel-owned Mon Valley Works steel mills operated at the same production levels throughout this time period, as they were deemed an essential service.
Such a dramatic decrease in toxic emissions is uniquely significant to Pittsburgh, Donahue said. The region’s long recovery from the pollution of its industrial past paired with a topography defined by hills and valleys means that harmful particulates tend to linger and concentrate more here, and this study shows that vehicle emissions are responsible for a worrying amount of that.
Donahue sees all of this as a compelling reason to ensure all autonomous vehicles are electric, particularly as traditional car companies have started shifting to that technology.
“It matters where the electricity comes from,” he said, noting that many power plants still rely on fossil fuels. “But they are real wins in terms of the local air pollution.”
But ensuring that electric future happens isn’t always as simple as strapping autonomous technology onto an existing electric vehicle. The weight and energy requirements of the sensors and monitors needed already limit the range of traditional fuel-powered cars, and would likely require more frequent battery charging in electric models. Still, recent research from CMU has shown that the increased efficiency of the technology and certain design choices to reduce drag can make any difference in the driving range for electric autonomous vehicles negligible.
Pittsburgh plans
Local companies are keeping that in mind. Argo AI, which recently announced a new partnership to launch its first product with Ford and Lyft at the end of this year, has plans to develop an autonomous version of the electric microbus Volkswagen ID.Buzz for launch by 2025.
“Looking further out, we would expect all of our vehicles that we’d work with to be electric going forward,” Argo AI Director of Communications Alan Hall said. For now, tests of the company’s autonomous technology are done on older 2016 or 2017 hybrid car models.
Aurora, another local autonomous vehicle company that just shared plans to go public through a SPAC, also sees electrification as a goal for its technology.
“The Aurora Driver is designed to work across all vehicle platforms, including EVs, and we’re working with a range of vehicles readily available from our partners,” a spokesperson for the company said via email.
Even larger vehicle-focused companies like autonomous trucking firm Locomation, which has offices in the Strip District’s Robotics Row, want to see an electrified future for its technology, though the challenge there is much greater in terms of distance traveled and vehicle weight. Pointing to recent reports on the increasing availability of electric passenger cars, Locomation VP of Policy and Strategy Finch Fulton said “you’re seeing a lot of improvements on charging speed, charging capacity, and the range of vehicles.”
While that shows promise for smaller autonomous vehicles, Fulton — who formerly worked for the Department of Transportation — added that “the Department of Energy estimates that for Class 8 multi-motor vehicles, those will not be technically and economically feasible until 2030 or 2032.” But when that technology becomes available, it will undoubtedly address concerns around vehicles that still use diesel, which is known to produce higher levels of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides than gasoline-powered vehicles.
Locomation is also looking for ways to reduce the kinds of emissions that are unique to long-distance trucking, Fulton said. When human truck drivers need to take a break for sleep, they often do so in small cabins within the trucks, which typically need to use energy to be heated or cooled depending on the weather. But autonomous trucks wouldn’t have that problem — no one in the cabin to keep comfortable — and removing or reducing idling from even one truck could save up to 1,200 gallons of diesel and 24,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emitted per year, according to a report from the North American Council for Freight Efficiency.
Automated trucks would also benefit from speed control and smooth driving efficiency that smaller autonomous vehicles have. The negative impact on the environment would likely be less if trucks were programmed to go at a slower, more efficient and steady speed. Trucks traveling at a speed of 75 miles per hour, for instance, will burn 27% more fuel than ones traveling at 65 miles per hour, Finch noted.
Pittsburgh policy
Though local analysts, policymakers and researchers alike look forward to the myriad environmental gains of autonomous vehicle technology, many also remain wary about the rollout of this disruptive technology. Eric Beckman, the faculty co-director of the University of Pittsburgh’s Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation is particularly worried about what conservation and energy economists call the rebound effect.
“I think most people who look at autonomous vehicles, and are also interested in sustainability, worry about this kind of rebound impact where actually you can get more miles driven when it’s autonomous, because it’s so easy,” he said.
“I think most people who look at autonomous vehicles, and are also interested in sustainability, worry about this kind of rebound impact where actually you can get more miles driven when it’s autonomous.”ERIC BECKMAN, MASCARO CENTER FOR SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION
People who might have walked or biked somewhere before might more frequently turn to an autonomous vehicle in the future simply because the option might be more accessible to them. If that happens, Beckman sees the possibility of a scenario where autonomous vehicles are actually worse for the environment, since people would start using them more often than they used traditional cars. But he also thinks that fate is avoidable, so long as local officials and companies alike remain mindful of it as the technology becomes more present here.
“It’s kind of an unknown right now,” he said. “And until these things become more ubiquitous on the roads, I don’t know how we’re going to guess” what the outcome will be.
That one of many potential concerns Erin Clark, a policy analyst in the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure, hopes to help resolve as autonomous vehicles become more present on city roads.
Though autonomous vehicle companies operate in the private sector, she and other City officials have worked to establish a relationship with local company leaders so that they can discuss strategies to avoid factors that could lead to such a rebound effect. Some of that work, she said, includes making sure these cars don’t compete with current public transportation systems or preventing the cars from “traveling zombie miles, looking for people to pick up.”
But Clark also acknowledges that the landscape is still constantly shifting around autonomous vehicles, and that much of the regulatory process around them could remain unknown until closer to a full commercial launch. Nonetheless, she shares the concerns of both Donahue and Beckman, and feels that the City’s continued conversations with companies about this technology will resolve any issues in its adoption along the way.
“I think having these conversations early and often with the private sector ensures that we’re saying our expectations to them,” Clark said. “We want this technology to advance because we think it could save lives and make people safer and hopefully, make transportation a bit more sustainable.”

Hyundai launched the first vehicle in its new all-electric Ioniq brand back in February, the almost-true-to-concept Ioniq 5 hatchback. And now the company has partnered with autonomous vehicle company Motional to put the shapely EV to work as a robotaxi.
The Ioniq 5 is based on Hyundai’s Electric-Global Modular Platform, with its 118-in (3,000-mm) wheelbase making for a relatively large cabin so that occupants can stretch out and enjoy the journey. The vehicle comes in several battery and motor configurations, and it’s not clear which setup will be used for the robotaxi variant at this stage.
But, by way of an example, the vehicle could run on a 72.6-kWh long-range battery pack for a per-charge WLTP range of up to 298-miles (480-km), and roll with a single-motor RWD option that puts out 258 lb-ft (350 Nm) of torque and zips from standstill to 62 mph (100 km/h) in 7.4 seconds.
Not that such things will be important to ride-hailing passengers, who are promised “a spacious, comfortable place to work, relax, or socialize during their driverless ride.” And should customers wish to amend the route along the way, or make additional stops, the vehicle will be equipped with rider-focused interfaces to allow for communication with onboard navigation systems.
The partnership is looking to make the Ioniq 5 robotaxi a Level 4 autonomous vehicle, which will use its suite of more than 30 sensors mounted around the vehicle to navigate without the need for a safety driver behind the steering wheel. This sensor suite of cameras, radars and LiDAR will monitor the world around the vehicle at up to 300 m (984 ft) away, and feed data into Motional’s driverless technology suite.
Numerous redundancies are being built into the setup to ensure smooth operation and passenger safety during autonomous driving, though Motional technicians will be able to remotely take control should the vehicle get into trouble.
The robotaxi is expected to undergo many months of rigorous testing in simulated environments, on closed courses, and on public roads, before accepting it’s first passenger, with Motional saying that the “testing is only completed once we’re confident our robotaxis are safer than a human driver.”
Motional has teamed up with ride-hailing service Lyft, and will begin ferrying passengers in Ioniq 5 robotaxis from 2023 across major US cities. But before then, the vehicle will make its public debut at the IAA Mobility in Munich expo, which runs from September 7-12.

Imagine a robot riding the elevator up your tower block, knocking on your door, and delivering the package you ordered an hour earlier: That’s the future of e-commerce in China. 
Tech giant Alibaba Group sees a fleet of robots as a fast, reliable and relatively cheap way to fulfill the burgeoning demand for online shopping across China, the world’s largest consumption market. 
In a big step towards hitting this goal, Alibaba is deploying 1,000 delivery bots across Chinese university campuses and urban communities this year. The bots, called Xiaomanlv or “small donkey” in Mandarin, can deliver about 50 packages at a time and as many as 500 boxes in one day, covering 100 kilometers on a single charge.
The bots pick up parcels at a local courier drop-off point and make their way to your building, trundling along sidewalks and in bicycle lanes. To be sure, they can’t navigate a flight of stairs yet, but the technology is steadily improving. 
In the future, the bots could gradually replace forklifts in factories, dispose of medical waste in hospitals and even move luggage around airports.
The idea is that these bots will “learn” how to navigate obstacles safely in low-speed minor roads and cul-de-sacs, such as serving a college campus or within a housing estate. Damo Academy will analyze insights gathered from these early models and then upgrade the bots to be safe to maneuver even on public roads.  
“In three to five years, we hope to make progress in autonomous driving in faster speed scenarios and make deliveries over longer distances,” said Wang Gang, head of Damo Autonomous Driving Lab in Hangzhou, in an interview with Alizila.Play VideoDelivery bots fan out on a university campus to deliver parcels
Last-mile delivery has always been the knotty problem of e-commerce. It’s costly, time-consuming and largely unmapped. This final leg in a journey that stretches from the manufacturer to the buyer can flummox human couriers. Delivery people can get lost trying to find a flat in a tower block or navigate a large housing estate. 
Alibaba’s robots will be able to make the trip without deviations or smoke breaks. Alibaba’s algorithm plots the fastest route for the robot to your door. 
The robot can predict the intended movement of passengers and vehicles up to 5 to 10 seconds in the future and safely avoid collisions. In test runs, 99.9999% of the time, the Xiaomanlv’s auto-driving algorithm manages without human intervention. For industry experts, this is known on a scale of Levels 0 to 5, as Level 4 meaning a high degree of automation.
The very top of the automation spectrum, Level 5, seems like a distant nirvana for autonomous-driving experts, given the reams of traffic data needed to make the robots and self-driving cars safe to travel on busy public roads. 
Level 4 is sufficient to solve the last-mile conundrum of e-commerce. More importantly, the robot’s positioning technology allows it to operate even where there’s weak or no GPS signal, making it a reliable deliveryman even outside China’s supercities.
China’s e-commerce market is the largest in the world and its growth has stimulated the swift development of logistics to fulfill customers’ orders. The coronavirus pandemic has also accelerated the shift in consumption from offline to online and heightened customers’ demand for contactless delivery of packages.  
Package deliveries topped 830 billion in mainland China last year, nine times the volume of 2013, according to China’s Post Office.
At the same time, there are fewer able-bodied couriers in China, one of the fastest aging populations globally. The World Health Organization expects the percentage of people over 60 years old in China to hit 28% by 2040.“We do not have enough labor to deliver so many packages to consumers … it’s impossible without automated technologies. So, this is why Xiaomanlv is very important,” said Damo Academy’s Wang, who is a key man in Alibaba’s drive to develop the bots. He spent over a decade researching artificial intelligence as an academic and now wants to put theory into practice. 
“I hope to build AI products that can have practical application and a big social impact, rather than academic impact,” said Wang. “Alibaba’s Damo Academy’s objective is to develop products that can be used – so this aligns well with my motivation.”
As consumers demand faster and more flexible delivery schedules, e-commerce companies are racing to rewire their logistics networks. The Hangzhou-headquartered group offers customers in China one-hour delivery, half-day delivery and next-day delivery. 
“Nowadays, consumers have higher expectations such as delivery to their building so that they do not have to walk for miles to get their package,” said Wang.  
Damo Academy is working closely with Alibaba’s logistics arm Cainiao to deploy the bots, known in the industry as autonomous mobile robots. 
Delivery companies such as FedEx and UPS still handle most packages globally. However, a few retailers are exploring more cutting-edge solutions such as drone deliveries. That said, there are relatively few drones in circulation, given the high level of regulatory clearance needed. Delivery robots, or bots, on the other hand hold more promise in terms of mass deployment. 
Big breakthroughs in the field of autonomous driving have largely depended on that lightning bulb moment when one or two engineers find inspiration from years of research. Many companies are still developing prototypes when it comes to autonomous driving, particularly when it comes to carrying passengers.  
Alibaba’s approach is to build steadily on the insights gleaned from the bots already in action, increasing the likelihood of developing a more mature and useful algorithm rather than relying on engineers in the lab.  
Wang believes that Alibaba’s algorithm is strong enough not to need expensive, high-definition sensors that some companies’ prototypes need to navigate.
“So, we can lean more on our algorithm to achieve a low-cost, mass deployment of the robots,” said Wang.

Artificial Intelligence. Machine Vision. Big Data. There’s a lot of buzz around advanced technology being applied in nearly every sector from construction and field services, to trucking and logistics. Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai recently said the development of AI was more profound for humans than fire and electricity. 
But let’s talk about the bottom line: how can these technologies, when used together, create opportunities to most effectively drive down costs and generate revenue?
Going beyond video
The most advanced machine vision algorithms can be trained to detect just about anything the human eye can see. Fleets have used this capability to optimize safety training and driver retention, and also collect evidence that can help lower liability costs in traffic incidents and reduce insurance premiums.
But this technology excels when data, machine vision (MV), and artificial intelligence (AI) are used in concert (MV+AI) to provide a more holistic context to events. As an example, a collision happened when a fleet vehicle collided with a car while both vehicles were merging onto the freeway, making it difficult to establish the sequence of events just based on video.
When combining the metadata from the video feed with the ECM data from the vehicle, and predictive data from a MV stream, the usage of turn signals and acceleration/deceleration by the driver were related to the event.
This data, combined with the video, helped establish that the carrier’s driver did not cause of the collision. When we solve patterns like this, we are able to further use machine learning and artificial intelligence to extend this sort of pattern analysis to other similar, unrelated events at large scale to automatically establish their contexts.
Identifying customer needs
MV+AI can also detect otherwise innocuous elements in an environment that, when combined with customer data, reveal opportunities for fleets to expand services to existing clients or even generate new customer leads.
These can arise not only during a driver’s route but at the point of dispatch or delivery. A waste disposal company that uses MV+AI could detect when a customer’s bins are overflowing and automatically suggest additional collection service that the disposal company can provide within the customer’s budget.
The company could also detect overflowing bins at locations along its regular routes and, combined with mapping data, reveal potential new customer leads or upsell opportunities. As an example, intelligent video can help identify specific areas where overgrown trees need to be trimmed away from power lines. Another example, related to municipal services and safety, is detecting broken traffic lights, faded lane markings, or missing traffic signs.
Predicting events
Ever since the invention of the fuel gauge, monitoring the mechanics of vehicles has been a key part of optimizing vehicle management and reducing costs.
But now we can go a step further. Pairing data from vehicle monitoring systems connected to the engine control module with a predictive AI means fleets can anticipate and prepare for maintenance. Optimizing maintenance operations also helps to prevent risks such as an engine failing while operating at 60 mph on a freeway, which can create a dangerous situation for all drivers on the road.
The further ahead fleets can plan repairs, the better position they are in to minimize the costs and disruption to operations. And the less time a service vehicle is in the shop, the more time it can spend in the field serving clients and generating revenue.
Reducing internal silos
Using all three – MV, AI, and data – together and concurrently across a fleet unlocks the true value of these technologies.
Having a single pane of control across company departments allows for the reduction in internal silos and reduces the risk that one priority for the company is optimized at the expense of others. In fact, using data in isolation can become detrimental.
An example that comes up time and again is the importance of compliance and safety departments using the same technology and data to make decisions in real-time. Drivers, for example, are limited in the number of consecutive hours they spend behind the wheel for compliance reasons. If fleets only optimized for compliance, a siloed system would just select the next available driver, rather than the next available driver with an appropriate safety rating.
Neglecting to look at complete data can be a major pitfall for companies and can result in leaving money on the table or increasing rather than reducing operational risks.
The future of data
Data is often the biggest asset a company has, and we anticipate that in the future more companies will use it as a source of revenue itself.
All operational companies, whether freight or otherwise, have something in their data that would be useful to other segments in their industry.  The data on the maintenance costs of a 5,000-vehicle fleet could, for example, provide valuable lead generation insights to a maintenance company. The safety data of drivers in different geographic areas would allow insurance companies to more accurately assess the risk scores of potential clients in the region.
In the future, smart cities will include this type of data, too. A fleet’s route data on hazards or traffic would be crucial for local governments when it comes to city planning or providing services such as waste or tree removal. Fleets might eventually be buying anonymized data from other fleets as a way to share intelligence on equipment that both use and uncover patterns that help optimize their use and lifespan.
Provided that the proper steps are taken to de-identify data, the future points to more robust data marketplaces where companies and even fleets turn their data into a valuable revenue generator.
As MV+AI and data capabilities become more commonplace and widespread, the fleets that can use it most efficiently to capture revenue and break down silos will have the edge.

The Chinese tech giant shared its vision for mobility of the future in the form of a robocar, capable of Level 5 autonomous driving capabilities.The company also launched Kunlun 2, its second-generation AI chip aimed at areas including autonomous driving.Baidu has focused on diversifying its business beyond advertising to artificial intelligence and driverless cars.
Back in May this year, a commercial driverless taxi service was launched in China by the country’s biggest search engine player, Baidu. It was the first mass-produced robotaxi in China and Baidu did not slow down ever since. The company that has been building AI programs to power self-driving cars just unveiled its first “robocar” and a second-generation artificial intelligence chip for driverless vehicles.
Announced at its annual Baidu World conference recently, the AI-packed announcement showcases the company’s advances in an eight-year effort to develop autonomous-driving technology. It also underscores how these new areas of technology are key to the company’s future growth.
As described by CEO of Baidu himself Robin Li, “We believe that cars of the future will be robocars.” In fact, Baidu’s latest ‘robocar’ prototype is capable of Level 5 autonomous driving capabilities. “They will drive autonomously, act as both an intelligent assistant and loyal companion, and be self-learning,” he told an online audience.Dashveenjit Kaur |
Li believes intelligent vehicles of the future will be more like intelligent robots. “They will move, they will communicate, and they will learn. The robocar will not only be your vehicle, but also your driver, secretary, and personal assistant. It will drive automatically, understand your words, take orders and continuously learn from you and upgrade to serve you a more personalized experience,” he explained.
Baidu’s ‘robocar’
The robocar adopts a boxy shape and features gullwing doors as well as a transparent glass roof and a display at the front to visually communicate with its surroundings. The body is integrated with a suite of external sensors to enable its autonomous driving capabilities, which at Level 5, means the vehicle is capable of driving on its own under all conditions
As of now, there are no Level 5 autonomous vehicles being sold in the market, and most robotaxis being tested by other companies operate at Level 4, requiring certain conditions to be met before they can engage in autonomous driving. The robocar’s interior reflects its self-driving capabilities, as it contains zero-gravity seats, a widescreen curved display, and a control pad, with the steering wheel and pedals notably missing. 
Other tech bits here include voice and facial recognition, along with an advanced AI system that analyses the internal and external surroundings to provide predictive suggestions to proactively serve the needs of passengers.
The robocar, however, is still a prototype and the company has yet to confirm if it will be mass-produced. Even before revealing the robocar, Baidu already runs its Apollo robotaxi service in some cities in China and as of the end of the second quarter of this year, the service has provided more than 400,000 rides and driven more than 14 million km.
Baidu began developing autonomous driving tech in 2013, ahead of its competitors, and in 2017, it launched the Apollo open-source self-driving development platform. The platform has attracted Chinese government support as well as powerful partners like Toyota Motor and Volkswagen, along with tech companies Intel and Nvidia.
AI chip for self-driving technology
In 2018, Baidu launched its first-generation Kunlun chip. On Wednesday, during a conference, the company said it has begun mass producing Kunlun 2, its second-generation AI chip. The semiconductor is designed to help devices process huge amounts of data and boost computing power.
Baidu says the chip can be used in areas such as autonomous driving as it races to become a key player in the chip industry which Beijing is trying to strengthen. The new generation of Kunlun AI chips, using 7 nm process technology, achieved a top computational capability two to three times the previous generation, Baidu said in a statement.
Kunlun chips have been used mostly by Baidu in smart electric vehicles and cloud computing.

 Can the e-bicycle or the e-scooter be the answer to tackle congestion? Car makers think they have the answer 
By  S Muralidhar 
The pandemic and its fallout is going to have a profound impact on all our personal mobility needs and consequently on the automobile industry. The impact will unravel over the next few months, even as countries around the world and our own states around the country attempt to return to normalcy after the series of lockdowns.
 There are differing views on what might turn out to be the future mega trends within the automotive space, with opinions ranging from a surge in demand for new cars and bikes due to the continued fear of taking public transport, to a sharp rise in sales of low-cost options like used cars due to job losses and salary cuts. Contrarian views are also being expressed about the prospects of electric vehicles- with ones that say the heightened awareness about the environment could quicken the transition to EVs, while others are speculating that the crash in oil prices will end up delaying EV adoption.
Meanwhile, the fear of community transmission of this virus and the need for social distancing is going to stay with us for years to come. And if the new normal needs new tools for people to stay safe while seeking to commute to work or go shopping, they will eventually be developed by automobile companies.
 One of the conceptual product trends of last year that seems like the kind of thing that might find resonance in a post-pandemic world is the last mile mobility e-bike. An electric bike that can be folded or otherwise easily stored inside the car and can be used for scooting to locations that are a short distance away from your parked car. Or at other times can simply be ridden to a workplace that is not too far. 
The concept will find a lot of new takers amongst those who still seek the comfort and safety offered by personal mobility even after they need to step out of their cars. It could also help ease parking woes and congestion in city centres. For now, it is a mix of car companies that are launching branded electric bicycles to ride the rising wave of environment-consciousness amongst buyers (like Jeep) and others who are hoping to pair an e-bike or e-scooter with their future EVs. Here are a few examples of that are already available at showrooms and some that will make it in future vehicles. Will you be riding one too?
Audi e-tron scooter
Audi had officially unveiled the e-tron in India, its fully electric compact SUV, last year. While the final word on its Indian launch is still awaited, here’s something else the German luxury car maker has been working on.
The Audi e-tron Scooter, is meant for first mile and last mile connectivity. It combines the advantages of an electric scooter and the skateboard. It can be transported by car, bus or train, and the 12kg e-scooter can be folded up and conveniently stored in the back of the car, or if preferred pulled like a trolley. 
The 4-wheeled Scooter’s handling is said to be like surfing waves. Audi says that the rider has one hand free, and so is able to look around and give hand signals. Production and sales are planned for late 2020. The steering handle gives stability, holds the battery and the electronics, and carries a display showing the battery status. Riders can accelerate and brake by means of a twist grip.
 The range of 20kms is achieved through recuperation when the e-scooter brakes. The hydraulic foot brake provides additional safety. Audi had said that at the end of 2020, private customers will be able to buy the e-tron Scooter for about Euros 2,000. Audi also plans to offer it as an extra to customers who buy Audi e-tron models. The e-scooter could be charged in the car trunk through a dedicated socket.
 BMW E-Scooter The other German luxury car maker BMW had announced plans to develop a simple multi-modal mobility solution in the form of a e-scoot that could be easily folded and tucked away into its cars for use later The new BMW E-Scooter gets a range of twelve kilometres and a top speed of 20 kmph. Two separate braking systems and embedded front and rear lights provide the requisite safety on the road. 
This easily foldable scooter, weighs just nine kilograms and yet, boasts the space-saving design of a city scooter. The 150-watt motor and lithium-ion battery slip away almost out of sight into the footplate and rear wheel. It takes just two hours for a full charge of the E-Scooter’s battery. Created as part of the first collaboration between the BMW Group and Micro Mobility, there is also another lower priced adjustable BMW City Scooter option that allows the rider to take it with them everywhere thanks to its triple-secured folding and locking mechanism. It was launched last year and is said to retail for about Euro 800.
Hyundai and Kia
In a move that could benefit both sister brands Hyundai and Kia, the Hyundai Motor Group had last year announced that future vehicles, sporting either badge, may be offered with an in-built e-scooter. The new prototype electric scooter unveiled in mid-2019 is based on its initial concept presented at CES 2017. The model has rear-wheel drive, a lithium battery and stylish front and rear lights.
The latest concept features in future Hyundai Motor Group plans to enable first- and last-mile mobility by integrating the scooter with future vehicles.
When mounted on a vehicle, the scooter is charged automatically using electricity produced while driving, ensuring that the user can complete their journey seamlessly. The Group’s engineers have added suspension to the front wheel to provide a smoother ride, even on rough surfaces.
The latest version of Hyundai Motor Group’s e-scooter features a 10.5 Ah lithium battery. This enables the scooter to achieve a top speed of 20kmph and is sufficient to power the scooter for around 20kms on a single charge. Weighing around 7.7kgs, the scooter is highly portable, with its unique tri-folding design, it also features a digital display that shows battery status and speed; while, for nighttime riding, the scooter is equipped with two stylishly curved front LED headlights, and two rear tail lamps. The Group engineers plan to install a regenerative braking system to increase the scooter’s range by 7 per cent.
Jeep E-Bike
If adventure and sports is your focus, then this one is for you. The American brand that makes legendary off-road sports utility vehicles has been one of the latest entrants into the e-bike category. In keeping with the brand’s DNA, the Jeep E-Bike is a full suspension electric mountain bike that combines the versatility of a 4.8-inch fat tyre platform enabling it to tackle difficult off-road conditions including soft sand, snow and also hardpack trails and rocks. It’s 750W electric motor delivers 160Nm of torque via pedal assist or by using a thumb throttle. To handle rough off-road conditions, the ultra-stiff inverted front suspension fork comes with 150mm of travel and the rear wheel suspension travel is 120mm.
It also gets a 10-speed gear set and 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes which are paired with 203mm petal disc rotors. The Jeep E-Bike is a Class 2 electric bicycle under US classification rules and so it has a maximum speed limit of about 32kmph.
The Jeep E-Bike has been developed with specialist company QuietKat and it has a range of about 64kms on a full charge. The only figure that might deflate your enthusiasm may be the hefty sticker price of nearly $ 6,000. No information yet if Jeep India will officially bring this here.

Clean Air Express and Santa Barbara MTD give customers options to tap-to-ride as a result of a California Integrated Travel Project contactless payment demonstration. 

Clear Air Express buses and Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (MTD) buses are being outfitted with contactless payment options.  
The fare payment system is being made available as part of a six-month demonstration with the California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP), an initiative of the California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA) and California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to simplify travel by increasing access to public transit—including easier, faster payments via contactless credit/debit/prepaid cards and mobile wallets on smart devices. 
The contactless payment system for Santa Barbara MTD and Clean Air Express is the first to be introduced among public transit providers in the Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo tri-county region and one of the first three systems to be deployed statewide. The tap-to-ride system uses fare payment technology provided by Littlepay, Kuba, Cybersource and Elavon.  
“Older fare collection systems create unnecessary barriers for people to ride and choose transit,” said Marjie Kirn, executive director of Santa Barbara County Association of Governments, which operates the Clean Air Express. “With the new contactless payment system, customers can now pay their fare the same way they can buy a coffee or groceries by simply tapping a credit, debit card or using a mobile wallet on a smart phone or watch with no registration or account setup needed.” 
In addition to Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards with tap-to-pay capabilities, mobile payments options include Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay and Fitbit Pay. While registration or account setup will not be required to use the system, an online portal will be available to all customers paying with a card who need a receipt or would like to check their recent rides and fare payments. 
“We are excited to introduce this convenient payment option for our riders,” said Jerry Estrada, general manager of Santa Barbara MTD. “We’re piloting this technology on 10 of our buses, serving Lines 12x and 24x. This means you’ll be able to get to UCSB, Downtown Santa Barbara, Camino Real Marketplace and Old Town Goleta with a simple tap of a card or device.” 
Clean Air Express and Santa Barbara MTD customers will see contactless payment readers installed at the front of the designated buses. If a customer’s debit or credit card is valid and has the contactless symbol on it or if they use a mobile payment option, they can tap it on the payment reader, look for a green checkmark on the payment reader’s screen and take a seat to ride. 
“Much of our goal is a more modern and consistent transportation experience throughout California,” said Caltrans Director Toks Omishakin. “Allowing riders to pay for transit with the same methods they use elsewhere not only increases efficiency and mobility, but also reduces barriers to using public transportation.” 
Automatic fare capping enables both transit providers to offer riders the ability to pay-as-they-go to receive multi-ride discounts when riders tap to pay with the same contactless payment card or device throughout the day or within a 30-day period. 
Santa Barbara MTD customers pay the standard adult fare of $1.75. Riders using the same payment card or device with the new system will automatically not be charged more than $6 a day or $52 in a 30-day period, which is equivalent to purchasing a one-day or 30-day pass.  
Santa Barbara MTD buses with the contactless payment capability will have a special decal next to the front door of the bus, labeled with “Tap to Pay” and the contactless indicator symbol. 
Clean Air Express customers using the contactless payment system will be charged $6, a $1 discount from the standard $7 one-way cash fare. Existing Clean Air Express multi-ride fare discounts are honored with the new system, with riders automatically not being charged more than $10 per day—or $150 over 30 days—when using the same payment card or device. 
Clean Air Express and Santa Barbara MTD still accept physical passes and cash payments. The contactless payment option is just one more way to pay a fare—and to do so in a quick, secure way on both transit providers.

Dominos, FedEx, Kroger, Walmart, Alibaba, JD.com, and Meituan all use rolling robots today.[1] Previously, ARK estimated that a sidewalk robots could deliver food orders for as little as 6 cents per mile, 20 times less than the cost of human delivery. Although local regulations may slow down the rollout of sidewalk robot systems, slightly larger robots that can integrate with traffic could pick up the slack. According to ARK’s latest research, integrated traffic robots similar to those from Nuro could deliver food for less than 40 cents per trip, six times less than the cost of a personal trip to the grocery store, as shown below.

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon.
Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, based on data sourced from Internal Revenue Service
If every household in the US were to use robot delivery for groceries, today’s average of 1.6 trips per week per household would translate into a $4 billion market opportunity.[2] Moreover, the cost and convenience could encourage customers to order groceries in smaller batches at higher frequency. If customers were to order fresh groceries five times a week, for example, ARK estimates the robot grocery delivery market could expand to $12 billion a year, paling in comparison to the roughly $70 billion cost of all household grocery deliveries in the US, accounting for personal car transportation costs and the “unpaid labor” associated with such trips, as shown below.

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon.

ARK estimates that robot delivery of groceries would commercialize roughly $40 billion in unpaid wages, converting previously unmeasured economic activity into paid services. In addition, roughly $6 billion in gasoline demand would disappear as electric robots increasingly replace gas powered cars, eliminating roughly 18 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, the equivalent of that associated with 4 million cars on the road.[3]
ARK believes that the use cases for robot delivery will extend past groceries. Dominos would create a $500 million opportunity, for example, if robots were deliver its pizzas.[4] Ground robot delivery networks also could work alongside delivery drones, reshaping consumer behavior by providing inexpensive and convenient ways to receive groceries, take-out food, and other household essentials. Home designs probably would change as well. If customers were to order fresh groceries more often, refrigerators probably would shrink in size and pantry closets would be repurposed. While these changes probably will take time to penetrate households, ARK estimates that the total available market (TAM) associated with collapsing the costs of last mile delivery and transforming how consumers buy, store, and consume food will be roughly $30 billion in the US alone.[5]

 With public and private partners, Pittsburgh’s city government is the first in the country to launch a digital system coordinating local transit options. It represents the local entrance to an international sustainability-minded movement.  Pittsburgh will soon be a national leader in mobility tech. 
By Sophie Burkholder / STAFF 
Earlier this month, the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure launched a two-year initiative called Move PGH, a comprehensive program convening private and public transportation options both physical and online to help Pittsburghers get where they need to go. Partners of the program include electric scooter rental company Spin, moped rental company Scoobi, local bike share system Healthy Ride, Waze Carpool and Transit, among others.
Move PGH centers around a robust app, powered by Transit, and 50 new physical mobility hubs across the city. While Transit has operated its services in Pittsburgh since 2013 and currently has over 40,000 users in the area, this new and improved digital hub will add even more transportation options to its current offerings.
Citing the recent growth of car ridesharing as well as shared bike and scooter systems, Move PGH underscores the need for a central place to find availability and pricing across all transportation options. Though Pittsburgh has been ranked as having the 15th best public transit system in the country and currently has 134,717 workers living within a half mile of transit, Port Authority has actually cut several services and routes over the last decade and saw sharp revenue drops during the pandemic.
Those cuts, paired with Pittsburgh’s hilly topography that can make walking or biking more difficult, mean that the 20% of residents without a car still struggle to get to work, the grocery store or other essential destinations. Transportation problems are inherently equity ones too, as over 65% of Pittsburgh’s low-income households don’t have access to a private car according to Move PGH.
One solution that’s gained popularity in recent years is what’s called Mobility as a Service, aka MaaS, which is the use of a digital platform to allows passengers to plan and pay for transportation across a wide range of public and private options. Such services could eventually make individual vehicle ownership obsolete.
“Mobility as a service, ultimately, is about making sure people have access to the transportation services that can help them get around, easily, affordably, sustainably, when they need them.”STEPHEN MILLER, TRANSIT
 “And so the City of Pittsburgh’s approach here was to really look at Mobility as a Service as a way to get these private companies and the public services that are available to really connect together and make sure that people in Pittsburgh have a way to access all of these together, rather than everybody kind of doing their own thing.”
While already a popular approach in Europe — with Helsinki planning to eliminate the need for personal cars by 2025 — Pittsburgh is the first city to adopt this approach in the United States. But Miller wasn’t surprised to see the local community pioneer this program. Unlike larger cities that often have a variety of extensive public transportation options, midsize cities like Pittsburgh have become more dominated by cars, giving local governments more urgency in connecting residents to alternative choices.
“It’s really forced a lot of cities and transit agencies in these types of midsize cities to think really creatively about how they can improve their services, and how they can be really thoughtful and creative about shifting trips to more sustainable options,” Miller said.
There are unique technical considerations as Mobility as a Service becomes widespread. A growing standard used in the field is the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), which several public transportation options, including Port Authority, have adopted as a way to share information with navigation apps like Transit or Google Maps. Meanwhile, many bikeshare companies use General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) while ride-hailing and taxi companies use General On-Demand Feed Specification (GOFS).
These differences aren’t a problem, Miller said: “Because each mode of transportation has different needs, it makes total sense that there would be different data standards for transit, scooters/bikeshare, and on-demand services.”
“Ultimately, all of these mobility pieces should be able to speak the same language and connect together so people can easily make these trips.”STEPHEN MILLER, TRANSIT
But there’s a challenge in making sure these standards are adopted broadly within the transportation field.
“Ultimately, all of these mobility pieces should be able to speak the same language and connect together so people can easily make these trips,” he said.
Beyond making transportation more accessible to residents, Mobility as a Service has the potential to significantly reduce emissions — a critical and persistent issue for Pittsburgh, which the American Lung Association recently ranked as the ninth worst city in the country for air quality.
Part of those pollution issues are undoubtedly associated with the heavy use of cars here. A September 2019 report from mobility analytics company INRIX showed that 23% of car trips in Pittsburgh were less than one mile, while 50% were less than three miles.
Miller sees Move PGH and future work in Mobility as a Service as a way of resolving that classic last-mile problem in transportation.
“Those are distances that are easily covered by either walking or biking or electric scooters or public transit,” he said. “And so making sure that we build up these options and make them easy enough to access for people so they’re not just grabbing the car keys to go a mile down the road is really important to shifting those trips to more sustainable modes.”

In urban areas, both big and small, parking systems are a headache for both commuters and city governments. Most resident parking, pay, and display systems are either overcrowded or not adequately located. One of the best ways to tackle both these issues is by using park and ride systems in urban areas.
What Are “Park and Ride” systems?
Thousands of residents use private transport to travel to work, make grocery runs, or catch up with friends. All these activities are necessary but end up crowding the roads, mainly if everyone uses a separate car. While carpooling is a viable solution, it won’t work entirely if different people have the same route but various destinations in mind.
That is where a system like Park and Ride systems can reduce the number of vehicles on the road. Under Park and Ride systems, commuters park their private cars in designated parking spots, which are well connected with public transport hubs. They then use public transportation to cover the remaining distance to their destination.
This intermodal parking and transport system is already being practiced in thousands of cities in various countries. In places where “Park and Ride” has been systematically implemented, it has helped reduce traffic congestions, thus improving public transport usage and better organizing parking systems.
Advantages of Park and Ride systems
Some salient features of every park and ride system are as follows.
Park and ride systems improve urban mobility to a large extent. As several private vehicles are not used simultaneously, traffic congestion reduces, which in turn, reduces commute time. The system also encourages public transport usage and generates more revenue for city governments.Carpooling, an effective way to reduce both pollution and traffic congestion in urban areas, becomes the most popular when well-planned park and ride locations are introduced throughout a city. As people do not have to struggle with finding a fellow rider the whole way to a destination, they also embrace traveling with a friend or a family member more readily.Even people from suburban areas benefit from a park and ride system as residents traveling to the city center need not waste fuel commuting hundreds of miles each day. They can instead drive to a park and ride lot and use public transit from there to enter the city. This advantage, however, is apparent only when the park and ride lots are also situated on the outskirts of a town.
Any park and ride location is best when located away from sites of heavy congestion. While easily accessible, these areas should not be located very close to places that remain heavily crowded, especially during peak hours. These locations should also be well connected with public transport networks so that they are incentivizing enough for all commuters. Once a municipality decides to construct a park and ride lot, steps must be taken for proper implementation and maintenance. It must be kept clean and should not be overly expensive.
Considering the host of advantages this system offers and the relatively small investment, it demands, park and ride lots are a future-proof way of reducing traffic congestion in urban areas. They also make cities more pleasant for both commuters and tourists, and when planned carefully, they have very few downsides. For cities looking to turn smart, park and ride is a must-adopt system.

Autonomous cars have been in the works for many years. They hold promise for the future as efficient methods of transportation, however, the main setback is safety. To get autonomous vehicles into the public sphere, manufacturers need to ensure that they are not only just as safe as standard vehicles but a step above that safety level.
Now, through the use of artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous vehicles are getting the improvements they need.
AI for Vehicle Safety
According to a Stanford study from 2013, roughly 90% of vehicle crashes are due to human error, at least in part. The idea for a solution, then, is to remove the possibility for human error by automating vehicles to operate on their own. That way, the vehicle can drive smoothly and keep the driver, other drivers and pedestrians safe.
Of course, before you can operate an autonomous vehicle, they must have the highest safety standards as well. Detection systems offer the first steps of a solution. Sensors and cameras on autonomous cars can monitor and detect where other vehicles and pedestrians are in proximity to the car. Still, these vehicles need more than standard detectors.
AI is now improving up the foundation of these safety systems. Artificial intelligence algorithms consistently learn from past experience, whether they were successes or failures. Then, when the system finds itself in similar situations, it can act accordingly.
As more and more AI-enabled vehicles start coming into play, they can all be continuously learning, reducing vehicle crashes that come from human error.
New Models Using AI
With AI’s powerful evolving nature, researchers and car manufacturers are working on new vehicle models that integrate the latest technology for safety. Notably, a team of researchers at the Technical University of Munich are working on perfecting an AI safety detection system. This system will notify drivers seven seconds in advance that they must retake control over the wheel.
The AI system learns from the driver’s past behavior. For instance, whenever you have retaken the wheel in the past is a data point that the system will learn from. Then, when it recognizes similar situations while you’re driving, it can notify you seven seconds in advance that you should start steering again.
Researchers working on the project state that they need more data for this breakthrough to become widely used. However, they also state that, from the study trials, the system is 85% accurate with its predictions and notifications.
As this technology becomes more widely available, it can help distracted drivers, alerting them away from the distraction and back on the road. Thus, AI will ultimately be reducing car crashes through its integration with autonomous cars.
Future Improvements
Some autonomous vehicles are already using AI to operate. While not entirely self-driving, Tesla models, for instance, have an autopilot function that assists drivers on the road. Newer vehicles are taking this integration a step further, too.
The electric LF-Z model from Lexus uses AI to help drivers get around, keeping them safe in the process. The car enables AI-generated dialogue to communicate with the driver about routes, traffic and safety. The system also continuously learns from the driver’s habits and behaviors to assist them further.
A model like this one, combined with the AI breakthrough from Germany could be a big step forward. It could be something you see on the roads in the next few years.
You may also see some 5G-enabled vehicles soon, too. These vehicles, using AI, can help speed up data transmission on the road. That way, your vehicle could communicate with others, constantly learning to keep everyone safe.
A New Autonomous Direction
With the breakthrough at the Technical University of Munich and the newer smart car models coming into play, autonomous vehicles are taking on a refreshed direction. Their path is gaining more and more support, safety and practically with each new innovation. Now, the future is becoming more clear — AI in autonomous cars is a game-changer.

In many ways, trucks are a more viable focal point for the development of the artificial intelligence (AI) for fully-autonomous driving.
The global trucking industry is worth $700 billion annually, and trucking is the number one occupation in no less than 29 U.S. states. In addition, the sector has emerged as the key battleground in the development of automated driving.
The efforts of tech engineers had focused on the quest to build commercially-viable driverless automobiles, but in the last year there has been a shift toward the commercial vehicle sector. This shift can be seen in several key partnerships that have been signed between tech startups and the world’s largest truck manufacturers.
Waymo, often seen as the leader in driverless technology, has partnered with Daimler, the biggest truck manufacturer in the world. Meanwhile, TuSimple is teaming up with Traton, a subsidiary of Volvo, and Aurora — which is backed by Amazon and has recently acquired all of Uber’s self-driving tech — has joined forces with Volvo and Paccar. 
In many ways, trucks are a more viable focal point for the development of the artificial intelligence (AI) for fully-autonomous driving. Long haul vehicles travel on long, monotonous highways, whereas the urban mobility navigated by automobiles and robotaxis is more complex.
The difficulty with developing the AI, centers around what engineers refer to as “edge cases” – those unique scenarios that are rarely encountered in your average vehicle journey. Put simply, there are more edge cases for the AI to deal with in complex urban environments.
Could the trucking industry reap the benefits of autonomy ahead of other vehicle sectors?
Cost savings with AT
There is a strong commercial case for greater investment in AT. One factor is the current limitation on human driver hours for safety reasons, which limits journeys to eleven hours. With autonomous trucking, the vehicle could be on the road for longer periods. It’s estimated that a trip from New York to L.A. could be cut from five days to two, resulting in significant cost savings.
AT is also being touted as a possible solution to the shortage of truck drivers. Although two-thirds of all U.S. consumer goods are transported by trucks, the American Trucking Association (ATA) predicts the driver shortage will reach 160,000 by 2028. By investing in greater levels of autonomy, the industry can solve the driver shortage while continuing to meet growing demand for deliveries.
According to advocates of AT, AI-based cruise control will save up to 10% in fuel costs. The optimized driving judgement of the AI can yield other savings, from reduced tire and brake wear to lower maintenance and insurance costs.  The process of optimizing journeys will make further improvements as the AT will gather data from journeys and use this to enhance fuel efficiency.
How exactly will AT work? Rather than automating the entire journey, the current plan is for a hub-to-hub approach. This means the autonomous, or semi-autonomous, heavy goods vehicle would transport goods from one depot to another, along a relatively straightforward route. The more complex last mile of the delivery would then be performed by a human driver.
A common approach to the development of AT is the development of a computer ‘driver’. This can be retrofitted to an existing vehicle, rather than having to develop an entirely new vehicle from scratch. For example, autonomous start up Aurora – which has agreed to partnerships with Volvo and Paccar – has been developing a one-size-fits all system that can be installed on any vehicle.
The importance of conventional components
Vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have always demanded high quality components. These vehicles must travel immense distances in all manner of weather conditions, placing significant demands on steering and suspension parts.
To be ready for the AT future, component manufacturers may need to raise their game. According to 2019 data from the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, 538 out-of-service (OOS) violations were discovered during vehicle checks, in addition to a further 1,000 non-OOS violations. Problems included suspension defects or steering-related problems. The most common steering-related defects were when components were found to be worn, welded or even missing.  
Although relatively rare, reducing the risk of component defects is of growing importance, as AT must demonstrate the highest levels of reliability and safety to become commercially viable.
It is not enough to demonstrate that an autonomous vehicle is as safe as a human driver, as can be seen from some of the high-profile accidents that have undermined efforts to develop driverless tech in other vehicle sectors. Whether we are talking about a steering universal joint or steering columns, opting for high quality parts helps reduce the risks of defects.
A decade ago, few would have predicted that long haul trucking would have been the focal point of new autonomous driving technologies. Now, the sector looks like it will reap the benefits of autonomy ahead of other vehicle sectors. Although the main focus will be on software development and testing of AI, parts suppliers also need to contribute by making sure their components will meet the unique challenges these vehicles will face.

Maintenance costs are among the highest operational costs for fleets, behind only fuel and truck payments when it comes to vehicle-based costs, according to the American Transportation Research Institute’s most recent Operational Costs of Trucking report.
One way to help control maintenance costs is for fleets to mitigate the chances of unscheduled roadside maintenance. As reported earlier this month, the American Trucking Associations’ Technology and Maintenance Council found the average distance driven between unscheduled roadside repairs fell nearly 19% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Marco Encinas, director of product management for fleet telematics provider Teletrac Navman, said fleets can use their existing telematics systems to help keep unscheduled maintenance in check.
He noted that the rise in unscheduled maintenance had a lot to do with the high freight demand during the pandemic, along with the current ongoing parts shortage.
“The one thing that we did see was a huge increase in vehicles, specifically OTR vehicles, during the COVID pandemic,” Encinas said. “Everybody was home, but the transportation industry was busier than ever. They had to keep trucks running as much as possible. It seems like some of the operators let some of that normal maintenance behavior sort of lax in order to get productivity out of their trucks and keep them on the road.”
On a day-to-day basis, Encinas said fleets should make sure their truck drivers are conducting required pre-and post-trip inspections each day, and help drivers better understand what to look for.
“It helps you schedule your maintenance for things that won’t take you off the road immediately, but you definitely have to get addressed sooner rather than later,” he said.
Utilizing tools from telematics service providers can also help drivers, as they allow fleets to customize a checklist of things to go over in addition to their normal inspections.
“When you do those pre-trip and post-trip inspections and actually do the work…that will get you ahead of any kind of maintenance issues and put you in the preventive maintenance mode rather than reactive,” Encinas said. “Then you can selectively take the truck off the road to get stuff done when it’s not necessarily scheduled to be earning any revenue.”
Encinas noted that Teletrac Navman’s system has a maintenance module that allows fleets to schedule routine maintenance for equipment based on miles driven that will alert the driver and maintenance department when the truck needs service.
Another usage case for telematics is keeping track of maintenance costs for each piece of equipment a fleet operates.
“It also helps you keep control of your costs and account for the costs that are going into maintaining your vehicles,” he said. “So, one thing is to do the daily maintenance and preventive maintenance of your vehicles to keep them on the road, but the other piece is now you can start looking at are you putting in more money into these vehicles in yearly maintenance than they’re generating? Maybe it’s time to swap out your truck and get a new one.”
One thing Encinas said Teletrac Navman has been working on, and continues to work on, is incorporating maintenance and productivity data of trucks as they run to determine the best time to schedule them for maintenance.
“There’s things that we’re doing on the telematics side to add more intelligence rather than run static reporting and static alerts, but also put more intelligence into it and help you make better decisions about when to take that truck in and stay ahead of the preventive maintenance.”

 Air Methods, an air medical service provider, in the USA, has announced the launch of Spright, a newly formed drone solution designed to help improve healthcare access and minimize supply challenges. Collaborating with Wingcopter, Spright is creating a drone-based, healthcare-specific delivery network across the United States. As a result of the nation’s efforts to keep healthcare costs down, Americans are impacted by a lack of immediate or timely access to healthcare resources. When these shortages impact the availability of blood products, medicines, diagnostics or small medical devices, the consequences can be dire. 
The solution is a flexible, rapid distribution network designed with 21st-century technology. This new drone delivery network will improve access to urgently needed medical supplies for healthcare providers and the communities they serve. Air Methods will make this possible by deploying fleets of Wingcopter’s new flagship delivery drone, the Wingcopter 198. The team at Wingcopter has the proven technology and production capacity to enable Spright to create a nationwide network, built around Air Methods’ existing infrastructure of more than 300 bases, serving hundreds of hospitals, across 48 states in predominantly rural areas. 
“The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated some of the real challenges in our health care system creating an opportunity to find better solutions to extend access to healthcare, especially in rural America,” said JaeLynn Williams, CEO of Air Methods. “That is why we are doing what Air Methods’ does best, taking to the skies, using the latest in technology and drone innovation, delivering hope and facilitating healing with speed and efficiency that was previously unimaginable. We see Spright serving a vastly underserved market and playing a huge role in a future full of better outcomes for everyone.” This fall, Spright will be kicking off this endeavor by partnering with Hutchinson Regional Medical System, in Hutchinson, Kan., for the launch of an initial pilot project using Wingcopter’s delivery drones. This project will provide a proof of concept of how this new and exciting venture can provide needed relief and certainty for medical resources in rural America. Spright will provide additional details on this initial project as the deployment draws near. 
The Wingcopter 198 is an autonomous eVTOL delivery drone that enables safe, reliable, fast, and bi-directional medical deliveries. It is designed to provide maximum flexibility and ease of use in operations. The company’s patented tilt-rotor technology allows for vertical take-off and landing, while also enabling efficient forward flight over long ranges, thus eliminating the need for additional infrastructure. The drone has a range of up to 68 miles (110 kilometers), a maximum speed of 90 mph (145 kilometers per hour) and can carry a payload of up to 13 lbs. (6 kg). 
“We are thrilled to team up with Air Methods to create a life-saving drone delivery network throughout the United States,” said Tom Plümmer, Co-Founder and CEO of Wingcopter. “Our technology has been used globally to effectively deliver medical supplies, for example insulin in Ireland, children’s vaccines in Vanuatu, emergency medication in Malawi, and just recently, blood samples in Germany. Our vision to ‘save and improve lives’ resonates perfectly with Air Methods’ legacy of providing lifesaving care, combined with Spright’s ambition to improve the quality of healthcare across the U.S. by deploying fleets of Wingcopters, and we are excited about scaling this together.”

The time we live in, the present, is the most technically advanced it has ever been. With these new technologies come advancements in every business area, from customer-facing technologies to predictive inventory to transportation management.
Smart technology is transforming the way companies do business — including an impact on your company, whether you realize it or not. Businesses are very swiftly implementing AI and IoT to streamline operations and optimize data. This technology has already entered the forefront in major cities, and it’s quickly making its way into transportation management as well.
How will AI and IoT transform transportation management? And what does this mean for your business and clients?
What Are IoT and AI?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is when machines reflect a learning pattern to grow their knowledge through learning. These machines recognize patterns and collect data to analyze, predict, and track future changes. AI helps automate learning to make smarter, safer, faster decisions in businesses.
According to Stanford’s Artificial Intelligence and Life In 2030 — One Hundred Year Study, AI will have a massive impact on all forms of infrastructure. From city public transportation to rural sewage systems to transportation management, AI can collect and process data faster than humans can. This has a major impact on the way businesses understand data and create strategies.
IoT refers to the Internet of Things. This is basically the network of all devices that are connected to exchange data. Connected devices include vehicles, home appliances, electronics, shipping boxes, robots, and even credit cards, and many more. The limits for connectivity are endless. In fact, there are currently 17 billion connected devices, and it’s predicted that this will rise to 50 billion in the next two years.
IoT is the wave of the future with regards to transportation management. Analysts predict that 70–75% of new cars will feature IoT connectivity by 2022. And this is only with commercial use; in the shipping and logistics sector, connectivity could reach as high as 90%. This is because AI and IoT can optimize processes in ways that companies could never before have imagined.
How does it benefit us?
Autonomous Vehicles
Autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles have already driven onto the transport scene. Artificial intelligence enables trucks to sense their location and other objects around them to drive with appropriate speeds and directions. From Uber’s self-driving car to Tesla’s Semi, autonomous vehicles are quickly becoming the wave of the future.
Currently, self-driving cars aren’t fully autonomous. Rather, they function like “auto-pilot,” allowing drivers to sit in the passenger seat to do paperwork or sleep while the truck is driving itself. This lack of full-autonomy is largely to do with social and government pushback.
However, IoT is making it easier for self-driving vehicles to be fully autonomous through interconnectivity with warehouses, route planners, and delivery checkpoints. This will make these trucks safer and more efficient than even trained drivers themselves.
Moreover, connected robots and drones are quickly entering the scene as new methods of autonomous delivery. This will especially have an impact on last-mile logistics and eCommerce.
Streamlined Decision Making
IT experts say that connected or autonomous vehicles are attractive because of the technologies that reinforce them. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one part of the equation. The other part is artificial intelligence (AI). It acts as the driver, helping the connected ‘thing’ (could be a vehicle or inventory system) make smarter decisions.
As applied to transportation management, automated decision-making ability is crucial. Connected vehicles, shipments, and systems help with tracking and historical reporting. But real-time insights and responses take place through artificial Intelligence.
Strong Analytics
This tracking and reporting software doesn’t just allow companies to have a history of their trucks and shipments. Artificial intelligence can then analyze this data to create predictive forecasts.
This constant data analysis can help identify inefficiencies in planning, inventory, stocking, loading, unloading, and even among the workforce. It can then help create a strategy to create more efficient processes.
Warehouse Management
Artificial intelligence and IoT connected devices have already made their way into several warehouses, including Amazon’s e-commerce warehouses. For example, robot workers can pick faster and follow high levels of quality control.
RFID tags are also changing the inventory game. RFID tags are connected to the cloud and share data on a given package or pallet location. This means the staff doesn’t need to scan every item for inventory or delivery. They can load and unload the containers, and the RFID automatically updates the inventory in real-time.
This saves significant time and money while improving the accuracy of stock-keeping. In fact, RFID tags can maintain 95% accurate inventory, while the average inventory rate floats around 65%. Because of these numbers, nearly 96% of major retailers are planning on adopting RFID tech tags.

Streamlined Process
AI studies multiple factors at once, while IoT connects everything at once. This creates a holistic analysis of all areas of transportation management.
Together, AI and IoT can look at the warehouse floor temperature, inventory, safety, and equipment performance. They can link warehousing with loading procedures, where sensors can determine the utilization rate of trucks. This can then be linked to transport, where semi-autonomous trucks provide ongoing updates about location and safety.
Then, AI can determine the speed of unloading and last-mile delivery.
This links together to optimize routing and planning. AI and IoT can analyze multiple facets of data to make processes more efficient from A to Z.
Slashed Costs
All of these benefits together can help minimize costs. AI and IoT reduce inefficiencies that throw money out the window. They can also help reduce:
• Gas costs by avoiding traffic or stalling.• Insurance costs by making trucking safer.• Salaries, since drivers can do work and sleep while on the road.• Replacement costs because IoT can quickly alert to maintenance issues.
Reduced costs mean a stronger bottom line for retailers and transport companies alike.
Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things disrupt logistics and transportation management by making logistics operations smarter day by day. It is expected that delays in pickups/deliveries and trucking capacity concerns will be a matter of the past when AI and IoT come into the picture.
IoT and AI are the technologies of the future and expanding at a speed like never before. Every business, small scale, or larger enterprises will greatly impact these smart technologies.

A COMMON perception is that time wasted due to being stuck in traffic, or when trying to find a parking space, could have been saved if your car was a fully self-driving (FSD) vehicle.
We have been waiting for autonomous vehicles (AVs) for quite some time after all the statements made by companies involved in AV production.
The truth is, the perception about wasted minutes is wrong.
AV will still take time as it follows the best route possible to get to your destination, just like what you do by following the best route selection guide from Waze or Google Map.
The only difference is that in AVs, you need not focus on driving. You can do other things like attending to Facebook and Instagram, reading your paperwork, watching YouTube or movies, or simply sleeping until you reach your destination.
According to the Society of Automotive Engineers, to operate a FSD vehicle, not only do the autonomous cars need to communicate with the infrastructure and other cars around them, they should also fully understand their surroundings.
To ensure safety, AVs must understand and react to situations based on traffic cultures, which vary from one place to another.
For example, in rules and regulations, both written and non-written, which are widely accepted in society; the quality of education (what people learn as they grow up), including moral and ethical matters; how effective is enforcement (strictness of law); and finally, the road system design.
Autonomous cars are being tested around the world, but there have been a number of accidents, making the idea of training artificial intelligence (AI) the priority in understanding diverse situations and reactions.
By having a clear guide map, AVs can predict reactions and act on them, becoming an integrated part of the traffic system.
Tesla and its chief executive officer, Elon Musk, have long been criticised for overstating the capabilities of the company’s Autopilot system. Terms like “Autopilot” and FSD have contributed to an environment in which Tesla customers are misled into believing that their vehicles can actually drive themselves.
Due to the latest accidents involving Autopilot vehicles, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration now requires companies like Tesla and Alphabet’s Waymo to report incidents involving driver assistance and autonomous systems within one day of learning of a crash, signalling a tougher stance by regulators.
Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group that represents all the major automakers and their suppliers, excluding Tesla, released a statement that singled out “misuse and abuse” of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).
It said it is critical that consumers know and understand the benefits and limitations of these features to build and improve confidence in proven vehicle safety technologies.
Misuse and abuse of Level 2 ADAS systems is extremely dangerous and threatens consumer acceptance and confidence in vehicles equipped with potentially life-saving ADAS technologies.
Another trade group, the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, which represents AV companies, including Waymo, Argo, Aurora, Cruise and others, echoed similar concerns.
But they stated there must be a distinction between their members’ autonomous vehicles, which do not require human intervention to operate safely, and driver-assistance technology like Tesla’s, which requires an attentive driver.
Let us not forget that AVs still have a long way to go before they get there. Rules and regulations must be in place, infrastructure must be ready, even the weather conditions must be considered.
It is better to “assume the worst and design for that” and not rely on the technology promising safety. The question then is, who benefits the most from an AV?
With AVs, transport businesses no longer need to employ people to drive vehicles, thus saving tremendously on salaries, medical insurance and other costs. Thousands, even millions of drivers will be out of job as these companies maximise their profits.

For the giant tech companies, supplying AV software and hardware to auto makers means a new, huge revenue stream turning their multi-billion companies into trillion-dollar companies.
So it is clear that tech companies and companies in the transport business will gain the most from the AV industry.

By Shubhankar GautamParking problems don’t end with the search for a parking spot. The costs associated with traditional parking systems are too exorbitant for the average citizen, altogether discouraging people from automobile usage, who are now resorting to alternative modes of commuting such as public transport and privately-owned shared car services just so they could avoid paying high parking costs. Let’s find out whether low parking costs encourage automobile use.
The Hidden Cost of Parking
‘Parking pain’ is a real thing. This collective term is used to include all stresses related to parking costs because the problem is not as shallow as the apparent cost of parking but has deeper roots. For instance – It often happens that drivers find it difficult to determine the exact time for which they might need a parking spot and to avoid exorbitant fines associated with parking violations; they end up making an overpayment. Moreover, certain parking garages have a very rigid rate card structure wherein a driver is required to make a minimum one-hour payment even when he needs to use the garage for just half of its time – 30 minutes.
If this wasn’t bad enough already, there are even bigger surprises. Too often hidden costs are completely excluded from the picture. For instance – INRIX Research compiled the world’s largest parking database where nearly 6,000 drivers from 10 of the busiest US cities were surveyed. The purpose of the research was to reveal the ‘actual cost of parking’ for drivers, the cities and their economy.
The shocking results of the survey stated that on average, American motorists spend 17 hours per year in search of a legal parking spot and the cost wasted per driver is an estimated $345 in fuel, time, and carbon emissions. Further, the research found that among the 10 US cities surveyed, the worst plight was that of New York drivers. In the Big Apple, drivers spent a whopping 107 hours per year on an average in search of a parking spot and the amount wasted in time, fuel, and carbon emissions per driver was $2,243! Such numbers are not sustainable.
Add to the above-mentioned numbers the cost of parking itself and it becomes absolutely clear as to why motorists are discouraged from using automobiles. When it comes to the cost of parking and its correlation to automobile usage, one can safely apply the basic ‘law of demand’ which states that all factors remaining the same, the demand for a product or a service is inversely proportional to its price. Similarly, as the cost of parking reduces, people feel more encouraged to use their vehicles.
The root of the cost problem, when looked deeply, lies in inefficient and obsolete traditional parking systems that have contributed both directly and indirectly to a hike in parking prices. Directly by not streamlining the parking scenario in a manner that is cost-effective and indirectly by acting as a breeding ground for the above-mentioned wastage of time and fuel and increased vehicular emissions.
Hence, to effectively deal with the cost problem, outdated parking systems need to be done away with, allowing a new-age technology to take over.
Smart Parking Technology: The Cost-Effective Solution
Fortunately, with the emergence and growth of IoT-based smart parking technology, the ax can be laid at the root of the issue. Since it was uninformed drivers going around in circles hunting for a parking spot who ended up wasting time, money, and fuel; IoT-based smart sensors and cameras relay necessary parking data such as availability of a parking spot and its exact location to the driver in real-time and in combination with advanced reservation features, they aid in eliminating traffic congestion, reducing driver stress, and avoiding unnecessary wastage of time and fuel. Moreover, since the system is automated, a driver can pay exactly for the time he ends up using the parking garage, unlike traditional parking systems where he chooses an overpayment over a parking ticket.
Drivers can also receive alerts so as to avoid taking routes that are overcrowded and can stick to less-traffic lanes for a quicker and more reliable trip. Naturally, when traffic congestion reduces, so does the harmful carbon emissions responsible for damaging the environment.
Final Thought: Low parking costs
So we see that low parking costs do encourage greater automobile usage but it is the use of smart parking technology equipped to streamline the parking scenario that not only a fair parking pricing system can be set in place but also hidden costs associated with parking can be eliminated.

We live in an age where nearly everything we use is “smart.” Our devices have long had the capability to bring the data of the world to our fingertips. Still, now the smart capabilities have extended to once-mundane parts of our lifestyles like household appliances and modes of transportation. As such, it is not only our personal lifestyles that are becoming “smart,” but they are extending to affect our cities and our nations, developing into “smart cities.”
A smart city takes the idea of smart technology and expands it on a tremendous scale. The city will use technology and connectivity to provide services and solutions to address societal needs: improve social and economic welfare, reduce environmental pollution and waste, improve safety and security policies, and open these services and solutions to be inclusive to all.
Smart Mobility
Many smart city projects center around the topic of mobility and transportation. This makes sense as mobility is one area where most, if not all, people participate or need to participate in some way or form. There are many successful use cases where smart cities are implementing mobility projects, using machine learning and AI to analyze data patterns and improve life for their residents. For example, in 2012, Pittsburgh’s city implemented Surtrac, an intelligent traffic signaling system, reducing travel times and emissions by optimizing vehicles’ movement through intersections. Analysis of the project found that the average travel times reduced by 25%, and cars spent up to 40% less time idling. This affected not only citizens’ quality of life but also the environment by reducing emissions.
This is just one example of how a smart city benefits its citizens. Still, smart cities are not just about how the city’s government officials can provide the infrastructure, services, and solutions to benefit its citizens. If that were the core point, it would simply be a digital city, not necessarily smart. A smart city’s very essence depends on its people to improve its services with gathered data, making it more efficient, more inclusive, and more secure.
Simply put, if the city’s residents do not participate or have the ability to participate, then the smart city is… at the end of the day, not so smart. While many cities are well on their way to planning their smart cities, when it comes to providing smart mobility and transportation systems to all, they forget about a key demographic: those with disabilities and mobility challenges.
Research shows that by 2050, 68% of the world’s population will likely live in urban areas, and of those people, roughly 15% will be those with disabilities: around 937.5 million people. Many people can relate to the benefits of living in an urban community: faster and often easier access to basic needs like healthcare, essential household needs, and transportation. However, for those with disabilities, getting from point A to point B is not as easy as it sounds.
Think of the different modes of transportation available: walking, biking, driving a personal vehicle, taxi, fixed-route transits (think subways or buses), ridesharing, carsharing. These methods are not necessarily easy or efficient for those with disabilities to utilize. With difficulty even finding a method of transportation, it’s said that 28% of those with disabilities rarely even leave their homes.
I mentioned earlier that if a city’s residents do not or cannot participate in the smart city, they are not actually becoming “smarter” because it is not fully meeting its goal. This is exemplified perfectly when it comes to the lack of smart mobility solutions accessible to those with disabilities. To get back on track of becoming a smart city, mobility and related infrastructure need to be barrier-free. Barrier-free refers to designing infrastructure and services that are inclusive to all, including those with physical or other disabilities.
Some critics may say that barrier-free mobility is already available. After all, we call “paratransit” or DRT (Demand Responsive Transport) services available for those who may need extra assistance in many metropolitan areas. However, I would argue that this is a grey area where many may fall prone to believing that this is an easy fix. While paratransit does offer more accessibility to people with disabilities, they’re often at a high cost with limited service (availability of vehicles, operational hours, distance, etc.).
On average, door-to-door paratransit service costs between $45 and $50, increasing with longer distances and time. This is not something that many with disabilities can afford regularly. Paratransit and DRT also depend on the vehicle to arrive at a specific time, and with issues like traffic or weather conditions, there can be delays or even no-shows. While being unable to catch a cab might not seem like an issue for many, for those with disabilities, it can be the difference between making it to a crucial health appointment or their work, a line of financial stability.
Short-term: Start with Utilizing Machine Learning and AI
While there’s no panacea to solving today’s mobility issues – that’s not to say that there are no ways to begin to implement changes to make mobility more accessible, inclusive, and barrier-free. We can ensure that DRTs can become more accessible to ensure that the operations are being optimized to reduce costs, lessen wait times, and increase dispatch capabilities to ensure that passengers can find rides when they need them.
This is where the core theme of the smart city comes in. By collecting data and utilizing machine learning technology, DRT services can utilize fleet management systems to dispatch drivers to passengers, reducing idle wait times for both parties. A smart dispatch feature within the fleet management system can also consider traffic conditions and real-time driver availability and location to more accurately predict arrival times, ensuring that there are fewer mix-ups and delays for both the driver and passenger.
Utilizing a fleet management platform will allow DRT and paratransit services to continue to operate at reduced costs. As the service becomes increasingly optimized, the services can expand the operation areas to allow more vehicles and more passengers to become a part of the service. There are numerous other ways that data and machine learning can allow seamless barrier-free mobility services, but it shouldn’t end there.
Long-Term: Expand Barrier-Free Mobility Into Other Infrastructure and Policy
When the goal is to ensure inclusion, a smart city’s solution to accessible mobility can’t just end at paratransit and DRT services. Accessibility and inclusivity need to expand to other modes of transportation, allowing for a more diverse experience and economic relief.
Thankfully, there are cities and organizations that are considering this challenge as they plan their infrastructure and services. For example, in 2020, Google Maps rolled out a new feature showing wheelchair-friendly routes, also adding on a feature where anyone can contribute accessibility information to the application.
Going further, with headlines of autonomous and connected vehicles beginning to hit the roads, we can also consider how autonomous driving technology can bring more inclusivity into mobility. Although the technology for fully autonomous vehicles is still in development, there are other developments underway. In 2016, the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research developed a self-driving wheelchair to navigate Singapore’s Changi General Hospital. And more recently, WHILL, a “personal EV” company, announced that it would be providing self-driving wheelchairs at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan. Perhaps one day, this can also translate into autonomous passenger vehicles geared towards aiding those with disabilities.
In the meantime, the barrier-free mindset needs to become a part of policy development. While there may be overarching regulations stating that accessibility is a must for public infrastructure, with the digital and connected infrastructure development changes, accessibility isn’t often considered when planning to change over to a smart city structure. Research labs, organizations, and companies can do their part to bring inclusivity to the forefront of these technological advances. Still, it can go even faster with policy on our side.
Conclusion
Having inclusive smart cities should be synonymous with providing accessible mobility to all. It’s not only essential to fulfilling the other goals of having safety and security, social and economic wellness, and contributing to a greener world; it is a basic human right to be mobile and be able to experience economic benefits and a sustainable, active standard of life. While it may take time and purposeful planning, to become a smart city and even a smart world––we have to put people first. The city will follow.

Last week, the Seoul Metropolitan Government announced that its city-wide public IoT network (Internet of Things) is on track to be completed by 2023, reported Korea Biz Wire. The operating platform is planned to be established at City Hall by the end of 2021.
The public IoT network aims to support and provide public services such as shared parking, smart street lights, and disappearance prevention through the use of IoT sensors.
The government will collect data related to traffic, safety, and the environment using these IoT sensors while enabling such data to be transmitted mutually to and from 25 district offices in the city.
Public IoT network based on LoRa
The LoRa-based trunk network will span 421 kilometers long, and be deployed across Seoul by the end of 2021. 
LoRa (long-range) is a low-power wireless telecommunication technology that connects sensors to the cloud. Based on the LoRaWAN® standard, it is capable of enabling real-time data and analytics communications. 
LoRa enables smart IoT solutions for low-powered devices and is used in energy management, natural resource reduction, pollution control, infrastructure efficiency, disaster prevention, and more.
As many as 1,000 IoT-exclusive LoRa base stations will be installed in public buildings such as community centers.
Of these, 195 are slated to be installed in the districts of Eunpyeong, Guro, and Seocho. These cities are currently carrying out pilot tests, whereas the other LoRa stations will be split across 19 district offices in 2022, and three district offices in 2023.
Public IoT network part of Seoul’s Smart City plans
These efforts to establish a city-wide IoT network are part of the Seoul government’s 102.7 billion won (US$ 85.8 million) investment into establishing a “Smart Seoul Network” (S-Net).
Unveiled in 2019, the plan was expected to unfold over three years. The government is addressing pain points in the city such as widely available, free public Wi-Fi (on the Wi-Fi 6 standard) covering 4,237 kilometers, with a priority on installation in densely-populated regions.
By 2022, they intend to increase the number of public Wi-Fi access points (APs) by over 200%. With over 6 million residents, the costs savings are expected to be immense. 
On a per-resident basis, the annual communications cost savings are projected to come up to 630,000 won (US$ 527) upon completion of the project. Annually, total savings in communications costs are expected to be around 3.88 trillion won (US$ 3.25 billion). 
Korea’s 5G to support its IoT efforts
Seoul’s IoT efforts seem right on time, as South Korea has established itself as an APAC leader in 5G deployment.
5G technology will be the key to help realize the full potential of IoT, as it promises high data rates, ultra-reliable transmission, and extremely low latencies. 
This is especially pertinent when it comes to Industrial 5G, which will improve efficiencies and flexibilities for industrial players, as well as critical industries.
South Korea an APAC leader in Smart City development
In 2020, Seoul launched the country’s first blockchain-based digital driver ID, with over a million drivers eagerly signing up for the service. 
Other than Seoul, South Korea has embarked on several other Smart City initiatives, with the most recent being the use of a decentralized identity system based on blockchain for citizen identity management in the city of Busan.
As part of Korea’s smart city strategy, the government has embarked on appointing special zones that have been strongly deregulated in the pursuit of various technological testing.
Busan’s blockchain zone is the latest in a series of “regulation-free zones” designated by the government in order to experiment with varying technologies and innovations. 
Six other zones have been established in various parts of the country. 
They include Gangwon-do (digital healthcare); Daegu City (smart wellness); Sejong City (autonomous driving); Jeollanam-do (e-mobility); Chungcheongbuk-do (smart safety control), and Gyeongsangnam-do (advanced battery recycling).

By strategically incorporating various mobility services, The COMET seamlessly addresses unmet needs of the community by providing specialized services for niche groups previously underserved by traditional fixed route and paratransit services. 
By Megan Perrero
When John Andoh* was hired as CEO and executive director of the Central Midlands Regional Transit Authority (The COMET), (CANADA) in 2018, the board said the system had become stagnant; ridership had started to plateau and there were several unmet needs regarding service offerings. So, Andoh set out to find innovative ways to integrate different mobility options to address food deserts, expand nighttime transit hours, connect people to employment centers, provide first-and-last-mile connections and expand service options for seniors and people with disabilities. 
“That was the catalyst of what got us to start looking at how we could be more of a mobility manager,” said Andoh. 
In about three years, The COMET has addressed all these unmet needs by introducing new mobility options, implementing technology upgrades, pursuing discretionary funding and leveraging partnerships. The COMET can now seamlessly provide specialized trips for niche groups previously underserved by the traditional fixed route and paratransit system by integrating these various mobility services. 
COMET on the GO with TNC Partnerships  
Andoh explains the frequency and layout of The COMET’s system created gaps in nighttime service and was “just not connecting people effectively to grocery stores.”  
Instead of accepting the status quo, Andoh began brainstorming of something that would be a low-cost solution and easy to get off the ground quickly. The answer? Establishing a partnership with Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) Uber and Lyft to offer a new mobility service, COMET on the Go!  
“We went one step further and came up with a creative idea that nobody [was] really thinking about before,” Andoh said.  
While TNC partnerships primarily focus on first-and-last-mile connections, this program is unique in that it addresses nighttime service gaps with COMET @ Night and food equity with COMET to the Market. To do this, the agency partnered with Uber and Lyft in January 2019 to subsidize rideshare trips that started by providing promotional codes for $5.00 discounts that increased to $8.00 in January 2021. Both services run seven days a week, with the nighttime service operating from 9:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. and the grocery service operating from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. The services integrate with Catch The COMET and Transit mobile apps. 
To better address food equity, COMET to the Market solely provides rideshare trips to grocery stores for people who live in food deserts as designated by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, improving food equity by removing barriers to people getting to grocery stores on a regular basis. The agency identified every grocery store with meat and produce in the area, so people can choose where they shop instead of limiting them to their neighborhood store.  
Pre-pandemic, ridership was growing, “and that was our mechanism of success—that we are truly helping connect people to grocery stores,” Andoh said.  
Another success to come from these TNC partnerships, specifically with the night program, is the cost savings. Instead of seeing TNCs as competitors, Andoh explains The COMET views TNCs as complementary to transit since it is more cost-effective for them to use cars for door-to-door trips versus running a network of buses carrying less than 1.5 passengers per hour.  
“Launching these programs allowed us to demonstrate that we are returning value to the penny sales tax [which was approved by voters in 2012],” Andoh said.   
Blue Bike Comes to Downtown  
Since The COMET’s TNC partnerships focus on other types of trips, the agency has leveraged bikeshare to bridge first-and-last-mile connections in the downtown area. Blue Bike, launched in January 2019, is owned by the city of Columbia, S.C., contracted to Bewegen and operated and maintained by the agency. The vision for the service was to be “truly integrated” into the rest of the system and not just a “standalone service,” explains Andoh. 
Riders have access to 18 stations throughout downtown Columbia and can purchase passes via the six kiosks throughout the bikeshare system using credit, debit and Visa or MasterCard gift cards or riders can also use their COMET Card or the Blue Bike mobile app. These options ensure accessibility for all by catering to people who don’t have a debit or credit card, or access to a smartphone. As a bonus, COMET users can get free, unlimited 45-minute rides.  
“We treat Blue Bike almost like a bus route because you can just tap your COMET Card on the kiosk and get that free bike,” Andoh said.  
Blue Bike is also integrated into all the platforms customers use to plan and pay for their trip, such as Catch The COMET App (Passport) that not only allows users to purchase bus fares, passes for paratransit, trip plan with real-time arrival information but also link to social media, Blue Bikes and the city. The COMET has also partnered with moovit and Transit to offer a Mobility-as-a-Service app, where passengers can check the status of Blue Bike stations, access real-time arrival information and purchase fares and passes. Real-time arrival information is provided via TransLoc. 
Vanpool Brings Transit to Employers 
The COMET’s Vanpool Program, operated by Enterprise, provides access to employment sites that are beyond the fixed-route transit system and allow commuters to set their desired commute, explains Andoh. However, the agency approached this service a bit differently than other vanpool programs.  
“We wanted Enterprise to go to employment sites that were not in the common fixed-route service area and sell the concept of transit to them, [saying] we’ll promote this van to your employees [and] we’ll pay that $500 towards the van. You help us in getting people to use the service,” Andoh said.  
This approach allows them to test the concept of transit and can be a potential catalyst to creating an express bus route if The COMET sees a large group of people regularly going to one employment site. Several employers have jumped at the opportunity of implementing a fixed bus route, such as Fort Jackson, McEntire Produce and Michelin.  
“Before, they had nothing,” Andoh said. “They didn’t know how to reach out to us on how to get something when the question was asked. And it also allowed them to reach out to people for job recruitment from areas where they couldn’t [before] because they [had] a lack of transportation.” 
Increased Access for Seniors and People with Disabilities 
Just as new services and technology is important, so is leveraging partnerships and grant funding explains Andoh, who tasked the agency’s grants and regional coordination manager to slow down their penny spending and explore other discretionary funds. Andoh adds the manager has been pretty successful in getting grant funding. One example is the Federal Transit Administration grant that was awarded for The COMET’s volunteer mileage reimbursement program and a subsidized transportation program.  
The agency partnered with Able South Carolina to launch the Volunteer Transportation Program (V-Trip) and the Taxi Voucher Pick Up Program (PUP) in January 2021 to provide better access to transportation for seniors and persons with disabilities underserved by the present transit system. V-Trip reimburses 57.5 cents per mile, up to 100 miles each month. PUP gives a $50 subsidy on taxi or ridershare (Uber and Lyft) trips each month. The services are operated 24 hours a day and are offered to people who live outside the agency’s service area, live in Richland or Lexington Counties and live inside the Columbia urbanized area.  
Another discretionary grant awarded to The COMET in partnership with Foenix Mobility is the Innovative Coordinated Access and Mobility (ICAM) Grant, which will increase access to healthcare services for residents.  
“We’re going to be utilizing their technology to connect seniors, persons with disabilities and low-income folks to healthcare in a more seamless manner,” Andoh said. “Foenix Mobility is also putting together an app to help people who need access to the pharmacy or medical or dental appointment [to] match them to whatever available transportation option is available to them.” 
In addition to more specialized services and mobile app, The COMET is also updating its technology offerings for its paratransit service. The agency has been working with TripSpark to migrate to its Passenger Portal that integrates with Trapeze PASS to provide notifications and allow customers to reserve and cancel their paratransit trips. 
Niche Services Boost Public’s Perception of Transit 
By tailoring services to niche demographics and providing user-friendly technology to access them, the agency is able to not only provide a more efficient, individualized service but also attract riders who may not ride a fixed busroute, but would use Comet @ Night to get home after dinner. And this has helped the public change its perception of what public transit can do. By being active in the community, Andoh describes how people are seeing the agency in a new light and as a way to enrich lives of residents.  
“People are starting to see The COMET as progressive and see it as valuable in offering mobility options in moving people from A to B versus this public service tax subsidy that’s not providing any value,” Andoh said. “People are seeing The COMET is truly a good community partner. If there’s an idea [that’s] pitched to me, we will try to find a way to make a transit component to it so that we can be a part of it.”

Technologies that give fleets a unified view of driver safety data can assist with proactive safety training.
Fact No. 1: Vast amounts of data are available to trucking companies. Besides getting real-time data from telematics, ELDs, dashboard cams and transportation management software (TMS) components, companies gather data from insurance providers and public databases that include motor vehicle records, VIN records and federal safety collections.
Fact No. 2: The transportation industry is placing an ever-stronger emphasis on safety. Companies are prioritizing investments that can improve driver training, avert nuclear verdicts, mitigate risks and manage insurance premiums.
Let’s bring these two facts together by suggesting ways that data can and should be used to address safety concerns.
Ideally, one platform could pull data from disparate sources and compile it into an easy-to-use mechanism like a driver scorecard. Otherwise, management teams are inefficiently stitching together data points and working with inconsistent formats and outputs, all of which makes forming predictions and correlations much harder to do.
Assuming you have a system like this in place or are moving toward it, let’s take a look at how unified data can help make you safer. The key is to leverage and analyze the data to pinpoint potential risks, and then respond to those risks with concrete actions to reduce the risk levels.
Preventive driver trainingData can be applied before and after accidents happen to provide extra training for the most at-risk drivers.
Post-accident training would obviously be based on whatever incident has occurred. The sooner the training happens after the accident, the better. Reinforcement or remediation of certain material can help prevent the inciting behavior and thus reduce future accidents. It can also be offered to insurers as good faith proof of efforts to mitigate future risk.
Proper review and follow-up are essential to make sure the offending behavior is being controlled by the driver. Compliant drivers – ones who observe the rules, and correct behaviors when they do start to develop bad habits – are safer drivers. Studies show that post-accident training reduces the driver behavior in question by up to 80% over the following year and a half.
Pre-accident training can be applied towards any area that your predictive data is indicating. It could drop incident rates by much as 30%. Examining the data will expose training opportunities up and down your organization.
For instance, is a driver lately recording more incidents of hard braking? Or is excessive speed up across the entire fleet? These data points will help you target your communications and training. Again, the process is much more manageable if you have a system in place to handle such workflows by identifying behaviors at a certain threshold, matching them with appropriate training modules, alerts and follow-ups.
You may also link accident prevention intelligence to specific routes. Data can tell you everything from what time of day a particular road is the safest or what section of a route experiences higher accident rates. The data can get surprisingly granular. Drivers can be notified accordingly, whether that is done manually through a dispatcher or via an automated workflow.
The results make these efforts well worth your time and energy. Better training creates more prepared drivers, which results in fewer accidents, less chance of nuclear verdicts, reduced risk and improved relations with insurers that hopefully will produce lower or more stable premiums.
Beefing up complianceNow that we’ve demonstrated how data can energize your safety program, let’s go a step further. A unified system and united data can aid in virtually every goal of your business, starting with compliance.
Let’s say the DOT pays a visit to you in Kansas City to perform an audit. However, your filing cabinets containing compliance paperwork are all in Dallas. While this sort of scenario is on the decline, it does exist.
Even if you’ve gone all digital with files, what happens if you have 50 locations nationwide and each location is a ‘silo’ that keeps its information separate and unintegrated? You will have problems with gathering, collating and presenting all of the data.
The right system will funnel all the relevant data into one vantage point and present it in an easily digestible format. Putting a system like this in place will help streamline and improve everything from troubleshooting in-the-minute operational issues to determining long-term strategy.
Fleet executives need to see how the data from all locations fits together to get a cohesive, overall view of the business. A real-time, bird’s-eye view of the corporate situation is an efficient vehicle for achieving control and visibility into all aspects of the organization.
Your data is what you make of it. A thoughtful and thorough approach to data management, usage and analysis ensures it will point the way forward to success in each area of your business.

If you think real estate is thrice obsessed with location (and it is), make room for geodata’s expanding role in payments, banking and a slew of related activities. The January 2021 Digital Consumer Onboarding Tracker® done in collaboration with Melissa informs on issues of the moment around how location data is making financial transactions safer and more accurate.
Saying location “is crucial to merchants, banks and service providers looking to reach customers in the digital age,” the Tracker adds that “maintaining accurate address information starts with onboarding and ends with ensuring that businesses have the most up-to-date information to tailor the final steps of delivery to their customers. Faulty data, on the other hand, can result in botched deliveries, inefficient operations and poor communication with customers.”
Faulty data. Sounds bad, but “terrible” may better describe it. “Failing to obtain accurate data and frustrating customers naturally leads to diminished sales. One study reported that 19 percent of failed deliveries are the result of erroneous address information. Such errors can cost companies hundreds of thousands of dollars annually, and large retailers report that annual charges can run into the millions if carriers must fix addresses to complete deliveries.”
Stakes are clearly high in the location accuracy game. The January 2021 Digital Consumer Onboarding Tracker® provides a focused view of how companies are getting it right.
Wherever You Go, There You Are
Geocoding relies on exact geophysical coordinates for a given address or location. Companies are using it more for logistical planning to fine-tune nettlesome “last mile” delivery snags for better customer experiences. Given the new prevalence of remote onboarding, collecting accurate address data is the point at which errors can begin, or be avoided entirely.
“Recent strides have been made in the use of geocoding technology, particularly in the financial and retail space. The precision and accuracy geocoding provides can open doors to even deeper insight when it comes to [firms’] customer data,” Bud Walker, chief strategy officer at Melissa, told PYMNTS.
Walker added, “Geocoding is useful for analytics: By plotting points on a map, businesses can identify segmentation patterns to more effectively target their customers. In addition, rooftop-level geocoding provides delivery-point accuracy. Giving retailers the ability to ‘put the pin’ in the customer’s driveway improves logistics and cuts down on shipping costs. Geocoding is also useful in risk assessment and fraud prevention. By developing purchasing behavior patterns, financial institutions can mitigate fraud by identifying unusual activity in a location that’s not typical of a specific customer.”
Address Verification Completes The Picture
Geocoding converts addresses to map points plus directions — indispensable in the delivery economy that’s grown exponentially since the pandemic hit. In new Tracker, Sunil Sharma, chief product and technology officer for Los Angeles-based online logistics marketplace Cargomatic, told PYMNTS, “Geocoding is a critical part of the plumbing, and final mile delivery would be incredibly hard to handle without it. Today’s shopper expects to know where their order is for every step of the shipment’s journey and expects proactive communication for any deviation.”
This comes in many forms, Sharma said, but location data has very precise applications.  “Optimizing routes with geocoding can stop a delivery from being missed or delayed by sending an 18-wheeler into a small neighborhood, for example. The technology is expected not only to improve the economics for all parties but also to reduce delivery networks’ carbon footprints.”
Precision, then, becomes the merchant’s friend and ally. And precision is badly needed.
As Melissa’s Bud Walker told PYMNTS, “Since address databases are often full of errors, it can be challenging to match this data with actual coordinates. That’s why it’s important to work with an address verification expert as part of [a firm’s] geocoding initiatives to properly parse, correct and verify the physical address data. Once [firms] have that foundation of complete and accurate data, valuable demographics such as household income, credit information and more can be added, giving [firms] the insight [needed] for customer profiling.”

By 2030, the world will see 41 million 5G-connected cars on the smart city roads. The prediction comes from the 5G in automotive and smart transportation application analysis report. This number will rise to a whopping 83 million by 2035. A three-quarter of these 5G-connected cars will be cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) equipped cars.
As per research, the 5G C-V2X cars will enhance road safety and improve the traffic ecosystem. Simultaneously, it will also reduce the use of fossil fuels by up to one-third. What’s more important?
The technology of sharing sensor data in these cars will focus on the protection of the vulnerable road users. These include pedestrians and cyclists. With 5G-based cellular connectivity in cars, experts also foresee the possibility of achieving the ‘vision of zero road traffic deaths.
But how exactly do these cars operate? Let us take a brief look. 
The Mechanism Of 5G-Enabled C-V2X Cars 
Cellular V2X is a global system of vehicle-to-everything communication. Its design intends to improve road safety and promote smart transportation such as automated driving. The concept is developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Organisation. 
The C-V2X uses 3GPP standardised 4G LTE or 5G mobile cellular connectivity. This helps it to send and receive signals from a vehicle to other vehicles, people and objects. In other words, it connects to other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and other fixed objects such as traffic lights in its vicinity. It works without network assistance and has a range of more than a mile.Advertisement
So, C-V2X establishes communication with moving objects on the road and the roadside infrastructure. This helps C-V2X-enabled cars to keep the focus on decreasing the number of fatal road accidents. And as this technology advances, it is anticipated to have expanded safety features.
Thanks to technology, it is gaining significant attention from almost every mobile operator and automobile industry giants. Some of the big names like Audi, BMW, Tesla and Toyota are teaming up to implement C-V2X trials for commercial deployment.
Potential Of 5G Technology In The Automated Vehicle Industry
Audi and Ericsson entered a partnership in 2018 with the aim to work on a series of 5G connected car initiatives. One of their first projects is a 5G-enabled automation application that focuses on personal safety.
Both Audi and Ericsson have been testing the use of 5G wireless network technology for the production of vehicles. Their partnership is showcasing the potential of wireless communication in production at an early stage. 
5G networks offer ultra-low latency which will act as the driving force that enables connected cars to progress exponentially. As per Marie Hogan, head of mobile broadband & IoT at Ericsson, 5G satisfies the performance requirements of industrial automation. 
Further, Hogan says that 5G combines all points in their production environment leading to enormous improvements in flexibility and connectivity. As a result, it “shows how humans and robots can work together safely.”
Therefore, this is the first time that highly advanced applications and system-critical IoT networking come together to offer greater flexibility, mobility and efficiency. This in terms of production automation.
Currently, the team is testing the potential of 5G technology for industrial application in the Audi Production Lab. These kinds of projects are intended to understand more about how wireless networks can be used optimally in a smart factory.  The statement comes from Dr Henning Löser, head of the Audi Production Lab.
The First Car To Hit The Roads Of China
Recently, China Telecom has announced the first production car in the world enabled with 5G technology. The car is named ‘HiPhi 1’ by HiPhi, a subsidiary brand of Human Horizons. The company is a part of the intelligent company’s “3 Smart” strategic blueprint. This includes smart vehicles, smart transportation and smart cities. 
The aim of Human Horizons is to develop smart transportation technologies that transform the meaning of human mobility. And this is to contribute to the advancement of smart cities. In partnership with China Telecom, the company will work on 5G technology research and implementation. The focus will be in the areas of the “3 Smart” strategic blueprint. 
Coming to HiPhi, the car will have the world’s first human-oriented architecture (HOA). The HOA is self-adaptive and learns to create diversified solutions to enhance user experience. 
It consists of a ‘neural network’ of four ‘super brain’ domain controllers and six microprocessing units (MPUS) connected by 1G Ethernet. The connectivity provides a higher communication rate than conventional area networks.
The car is capable of analysing massive amounts of data and making decisions. This is as per the claims of the partnership. To do so, the car will make use of cloud computing with a powerful data analysis engine. Altogether, this will give birth to a truly intelligent and smart vehicle. 
The HiPhi 1 will run on electricity with a 5G-V2X enabled communication network. It will feature more than five hundred sensors possessing the excellent capability to connect between cars, roads and cities.
As per reports, the automaker’s partnership with China Telecom is one-of-its-kind. This collaboration will help expedite the commercialisation of 5G in the automated vehicles industry. The commercial rollout of HiPhi 1 is expected from the beginning of 2021. 
The Roll Out Of HiCar 
Huawei’s 5G-based C-V2X HiCar technology is grabbing the attention of many automakers. The technology offers an interface to the car’s core operating system. Alongside, it also aids in connecting a car to everything – from moving to non-moving objects on the road.
It has the capability to connect to traffic lights, cameras and speed limit signals. 30 different auto brands will be using HiCar technology for the arriving models. Huawei has already signed up 18 automakers such as Audi and Toyota to use the technology.
However, the first one to showcase HiCar’s potential on the road will be BYD, China’s largest EV maker. BYD will be using HiCar in its upgraded Han flagship electric sedan. It’s car ‘Han EV’ will make its first appearance in June 2020.
The car will have a slight resemblance to Tesla Model 3 in China in terms of style and initial price (about $40,000). With the use of the latest lithium iron phosphate batteries in multiple pack sizes, the Han EV will traverse up to 375 miles. It reaches a speed of 60 mph in less than 4 seconds.
Among Chinese battery makers, BYD stands in second place with 10.76 GWh capacity, after battery giant CATL. As the company claims, its blade-shaped design enhances space utilisation by over 50% than other pack layouts. And the design is safer than other competitors. 
Why Will 5G Cars First Appear On Chinese Roads?
China has already completed deployment of almost 200,000 5G base stations across the nation. By the end of 2020, the country will have 500,000 5G base stations deployed. The report is as per the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China. 
The number of 5G base stations is increasing in China. Evidently, China is on the way to becoming the first country to have C-V2X deployed. The rapidly increasing installation of 5G networks will play a huge role in expanding the C-V2X market size.
Not just in China, but other parts of the world as well. We may see it by the first quarter of 2021.

AI-driven capabilities have catapulted route planning optimization technology forward. While AI will drive the future of trucking, it’s also driving the present with optimization technology.
The global pandemic has paused or inhibited momentum for a number of industries, but not the trucking industry.
The economy relies heavily on drivers and fleets. Although it faces various obstacles — including increased demand and fewer drivers to meet it – the trucking industry continues to see significant growth.
According to the American Trucking Association, the trucking industry was short roughly 60,800 drivers back in 2018, and the shortage has continued. Experts estimate 80,000 fewer available drivers on the roads in 2021 vs. a year ago. A combined higher demand and lack of qualified drivers requires fleets to accelerate their digital transformation efforts to keep pace.
More fleets than ever before are leveraging cloud-based software and data to decrease planning time and optimize workflows. Fleet management software platforms enable fleets to do more with less and increase driver efficiency, which helps drivers complete more stops and thrive in a supportive work environment.
What specific capabilities have fleets invested in to rise above the competition, improve decision-making and meet demand?
Route optimization technologyAI-driven capabilities have catapulted route planning optimization technology forward. While AI will drive the future of trucking, it’s also driving the present with optimization technology. 
This technology automates driver plans to set both fleets and drivers up for success. By taking data and constantly-changing variables like weather and construction into account, planners can assign drivers to routes that save time and reduce missed deliveries. AI has raised the industry standard for efficient route planning, and trucking has recognized the value of automated route optimization technology. Automation capabilities will continue to evolve and advance transportation management processes.
Drivers, as well as fleets, benefit from route optimization. AI-based software will increasingly enhance the driver experience by more effectively utilizing their skillsets.
Eventually, route optimization software will start taking additional driver variables into account, such as their experience levels and preferences. For instance, fleets could create smoother, more efficient dispatching and driver training processes by automatically assigning new drivers to easier routes.
Driver workflow softwareThe buzz around “workflow” is well-deserved these days. Drivers can use trip and location-enabled apps to access the digital forms they need for each stop and customer, saving time by reducing paperwork and bypassing unnecessary steps that, in the past, had caused manual-based errors.
Driver workflow solutions increase fleet flexibility.
With more advanced driver workflow software, each trucking company can customize their workflow steps and forms for drivers to suit their specific needs. These flexible forms and workflows improve the overall driver experience, which could lead to increased driver retention in the midst of a serious shortage. These solutions also boost productivity for all users: managers, dispatchers, planners, and drivers alike.
Driver workflow solutions also streamline communication.
Managers and drivers who use workflow software can communicate more easily via real-time data visibility, constant ETA updates and in-app messaging tools. Enhanced communication ensures operational efficiency and data integrity – critical for fleet managers and planners.
Driver workflow solutions streamline onboarding.
With fleets trying to meet constant demand, they’re always seeking ways to streamline the driver hiring and training process. Driver workflow technology eliminates those tedious, lengthy processes by reducing training time. A more intuitive dashboard means that drivers spend less time learning how to use and become comfortable with the software. Fleets benefit by saving money, time, and resources.
Trucking industry will benefit from embracing digital transformationManagers and executives working to meet demand, increase efficiency and hire, train, and retain drivers need reliable fleet optimization solutions. In the midst of a pandemic and driver shortage, fleets that utilize route and workflow optimization technology can accomplish more with less. These digital transformation efforts use data and AI to improve decision-making and enable fleets to rise above the competition.
The future of transportation management has arrived; those who choose to ignore the technology will find themselves left far behind.

Electric bikes come with substantial environmental and social benefits, but some marginalized communities are being left out. Here’s why — and what they’re doing about it. 
By Henry Latourette Miller 
This summer has the potential to be the first season of a new era of biking in Portland. It follows a year that saw bike sales skyrocket, the introduction of electric bikes (e-bikes) to Biketown, the expansion of Biketown’s service area to the north and east, and the restriction of car traffic to install sidewalk cafes and improve streets for walkers and rollers.
While these developments are exciting, it is hard to overstate the potential for e-bikes to inject new energy into Portland’s bike culture, which had seen bike commuter rates slide in the years before the pandemic.
By allowing Portlanders to go greater distances with less effort than a normal bike, thanks to an electric motor and battery, e-bikes can bring together the necessary reduction in emissions from cars with America’s love of independent mobility. Unlike scooters, e-bikes are more comfortable when traveling across town and can be powerful enough to carry multiple riders along with groceries and school bags. This power makes it easier for Portlanders to swap what was once a car trip to the store, school or office with a more sustainable mode of transportation, even if they do not have access to good transit options. If enough people make that switch, e-bikes can contribute to making our streets less congested, less polluted, safer and more efficient.
Yet Portland’s embrace of new transportation technologies has often come at the cost of already marginalized community members. This is especially the case for low-income residents and people of color, many of who were pushed out of their neighborhoods to build projects like the Interstate-5 corridor or by the gentrification that followed the construction of TriMet’s MAX Yellow Line.
Jump to years later, and many of the low-income and communities of color in outer Portland neighborhoods that did not experience the same rapid pace of gentrification were also not included in the early service areas of Biketown and e-scooter shares. While the reasons these neighborhoods were excluded from shared mobility in its early years may have been different from the outwardly racist and classist reasoning behind the location of I-5, in many cases the communities left out of the benefits of new technology are the same.
Considering the weight of this history, Portland’s agencies and community leaders have many mountains to climb to ensure e-mobility does not slide into the ravines of injustice created by previous planning decisions.
To see how this can be accomplished, I spoke to five advocates who are working with or within communities that have traditionally been denied the benefits of new transportation technology while shouldering its costs. During our conversations, these advocates revealed four core obstacles to a truly equitable e-bike landscape: price, privacy, payment methods and the built environment.
Price
The first barrier most people encounter when considering e-mobility is the price. At the moment, quality personal-use e-bikes cost at least $1,000, not including the cost of storage and maintenance. This is a lot of money to spend if the initial intention is to use the e-bike as a backup mode of transportation or recreational device.
For those who are interested in e-bikes but cannot afford to drop $1,000 just to try out a new way to get around, shared e-bikes are the best way to test the water without getting too wet.
Yet even though Portland’s bike share, Biketown, lowers the upfront cost to e-bikes for Portlanders, it can still be expensive over time. An annual Biketown membership is $99 plus 10 cents per minute of riding time — a substantial increase over the price of renting the analog Biketown bikes. If you were to bike 40 minutes every workday, the total cost of using your annual Biketown membership today would come to about $1,150.
For someone on a budget who uses their car or TriMet pass not only to get to work, but also to pick up their kids from school or get groceries, switching to Biketown might not make a lot of sense. This is especially true if they have access to free or reduced-price public transit through TriMet’s Low Income Fare Program or the Honored Citizen annual pass, which costs $308 per year.
Cole Lalomia, of the Community Cycling Center, said keeping Biketown’s prices down is critical to making e-biking accessible, as the price, complexity and lack of equipment standardization suggests that affordable personal-use e-bikes could still be years away.
Community Cycling Center is a Northeast Portland-based nonprofit that has been fixing up bikes and teaching kids how to become bike mechanics for two decades. Recently, it has been advocating for better bike infrastructure, including bike parking and greenways in underserved communities, and providing support to community programs and events. Since the start of pandemic, the Community Cycling Center has collaborated with Living Cully on a food pantry delivery program that uses four e-bikes purchased with help from a Portland General Electric grant to deliver food to residents primarily in the Cully neighborhood.
To reduce Biketown’s overall cost for low-income users, Community Cycling Center joined other community-based organizations in 2016 to work with the Portland Bureau of Transportation to create Biketown For All. (Street Roots vendors have been recipients of reduced-priced bike rentals through this program.) Today, Biketown for All allows residents who qualify for state and federal assistance programs such as SNAP food assistance and Oregon Health Plan to pay only $5 per month and five cents per minute, with an additional $20 in free ride credits every month. While this is a jump from the $3-per-month membership Biketown For All provided before the introduction of e-bikes in 2020, riding Biketown’s new bikes 40 minutes every workday can cost as little as $28.50 per month, or $342 a year. Compared to the average annual cost of $8,400 per year to own and maintain a car in Portland, this is a dramatically less expensive way to access a more independent and flexible mobility than transit.
When it comes to Biketown, Lalomia said its new e-bikes “are a gateway into increased e-bike ridership in general.” Lalomia also believes Biketown’s new riders might start saving up to purchase their own e-bikes once they realize “how far they can go, they realize how fast they can go, they realize how little effort they need to put in.”
Privacy and payment methods
Unfortunately, shared mobility providers like Biketown introduce new technological challenges that are trickier to address than prices. Most e-mobility devices are activated with a smartphone and paid for through an online bank account, which local community development corporation Hacienda CDC and digital justice nonprofit Suma have identified as significant barriers to the communities they serve.
While electronic payments can cut down substantially on the hassle of e-mobility and other essential services for many, not every Portlander has a smartphone or bank account. Despite Biketown For All and a few private shared mobility companies allowing riders to pay for memberships using cash or a prepaid debit card, those riders typically have to travel downtown to make this transaction.
Suma Executive Director Alan Hipólito pointed out that this extra step is a reflection of how frontline communities, who could benefit just as much or more from better mobility options and reduced emissions, have not been given the opportunity to shape shared mobility. “Many of these systems are set up to be technologically seamless,” said Hipólito. “And when you try to go outside of that, it’s by definition a workaround.”
Hacienda CDC’s Jessica Lam has also found that just because someone has a smartphone and bank account, it does not mean they feel comfortable using the Biketown app or sharing their personal information online. “A lot of our families rely on younger kids, the high school kids, to help navigate all of that,” said Lam, who praised a Suma workshop that taught a small group of Hacienda’s community members how to navigate the internet safely. The workshop included lessons on inputting personal information safely and avoiding phishing scams.
Suma is working to address the above challenges through community organizing, training and informational sessions, and by creating its own community-based digital platform (the “secret sauce” of which Hipólito kept under wraps).
“One of the challenges of technology is that there are not many technology companies that are started specifically with an eye to address poverty or justice. So companies don’t come to neighborhoods like Cully to build platforms to co-create them with people who live there. That’s what we are trying to do,” said Hipólito. “We think there’s an opportunity at the community level to build a different kind of platform that is specifically built to serve these kinds of communities, that is specifically built to overcome cost, privacy and banking.”
The built environment
For decades, most of Portland’s streets were designed and redesigned for the benefit of the automobile, usually at the cost of safety for pedestrians and cyclists. Even as the Portland Bureau of Transportation continues to install better bike and pedestrian infrastructure on Northeast Portland streets such as Killingsworth Street and Cully Boulevard, many frontline communities live in areas with a higher density of PBOT-identified High Crash Network streets and intersections.
In the 2000s, Hacienda CDC created Verde, a nonprofit that serves low-income residents of Cully by “building environmental wealth” for the community. While Cully saw more of its streets included in Biketown’s 2020 service area expansion, Verde’s director of strategic partnerships, Vivian Satterfield, believes that substantial infrastructure investments are needed in Cully before we can expect residents to feel safe using e-bikes to get around. “While some may feel confident taking a bicycle or another mobility device on a gravel road, a majority of folks don’t find that confidence easily,” said Satterfield, referring to the concentration of unpaved streets in Cully.
While Satterfield sees the merit of shared mobility provided by private companies, she stressed that the priority in Cully should be affordable, accessible and frequent mass transit, “because then we have all the public investments that support a mass transit system. Stuff like sidewalks and paved streets and lower speed limits in thoroughfares, and transportation infrastructure like shelter and lighting. That’s public infrastructure, and I don’t believe that private enterprises are ever going to deliver all of those corollary needs.”
Despite the inhospitable environment for cyclists in Portland’s outer neighborhoods, the Rosewood Initiative’s Jossie de la Garza has noticed more people in the neighborhood taking interest in recreational biking since the pandemic began.
The area de la Garza’s organization serves is still beyond Biketown’s service area, but she has noticed the bike repair shop next to the organization’s headquarters on Southeast 162nd Avenue and Stark Street staying busy throughout the past year. “COVID has definitely made it apparent how much outdoor space does matter, especially in the Rosewood neighborhood, where you have a lot of apartment complexes, but not enough green space,” de la Garza said.
Yet this enthusiasm for bikes as a form of recreation also hints at why some residents might never use their bikes for anything more. It’s not just the high traffic and car speeds that punish cyclists in the outer east-side neighborhoods. A history of poor transit access and a lack of nearby job centers and services mean that if you decide to bike for utility, you likely face a long ride.
De la Garza said larger families would struggle to rely on regular bikes for non-recreational trips, as the distances and errands — from groceries to visiting the doctor to picking up kids from school — would be too unwieldy. De la Garza believes e-bikes might address these practical problems to some degree.
While adding new bike infrastructure would make it safer to bike in the neighborhood, de la Garza thinks there are community members who would be concerned that it might result in gentrification of a neighborhood that is 30% Latino. “That’s something we always have in the back of our mind, and I think that’s why it’s much more important to have the community involved” with any new bike infrastructure projects in the neighborhood.
Both Lam and de la Garza said they expect their organizations to work with PBOT this summer to discuss improving bike infrastructure and Biketown access for their communities. In the meantime, de la Garza expects to see even more residents take up biking around the neighborhood.
Hope for the future
Despite the challenges, Hipólito believes there is an opportunity for shared e-mobility to be different than previous innovations in transportation.
Many private shared mobility providers are new companies in a political environment where it is getting harder to ignore the negative consequences their services might have on frontline communities. Some e-mobility providers “are seeing a real opportunity to serve frontline communities,” Hipólito said.
As e-mobility is still a young industry, Hipólito believes these companies have the flexibility to decide, “Well, just because we did something this way over here doesn’t mean we can’t try something different in Cully, or in this other community in Portland, if it means we have a chance to respond to what the community wants us to do.”

Researchers say the future of transportation will be shaped by three “revolutions” – vehicle electrification, driverless cars and ride-sharing – that could result in fewer automobiles on the road, less fossil fuels extracted from the Earth and less pollution in the air. While the environmental gains may seem self-evident, the health benefits are difficult to quantify.
Now for the first time, a Cornell-led team has used transdisciplinary systems modeling to calculate those health benefits in the United States. By 2050, these innovations could potentially slash petroleum consumption by 50% and carbon dioxide emissions by 75% while simultaneously preventing 5,500 premature deaths, with an annual savings of $58 billion.
“There are all these important emerging trends in the development of transportation, and they are becoming a reality in the near future,” said Oliver Gao, the Howard Simpson Professor of civil and environmental engineering in the College of Engineering, who led the project.
“Have you ever thought about what all these revolutions mean for your health, for our climate, and for our environment, and for our energy systems?” Gao said. “These externalities don’t necessarily come directly in the mind of the general public, the travelers, or even the decision-makers.”
The group’s paper, “Shared Use of Electric Autonomous Vehicles: Air Quality and Health Impacts of Future Mobility in the United States,” published June 26 in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. The paper’s lead author is former postdoctoral researcher Shuai Pan.
“It is worthwhile to understand the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies, as deep de-carbonization is needed in the transportation sector,” Pan said.
Co-authors include Lewis M. Fulton from the University of California, Davis, and Yunsoo Choi and Jia Jung from the University of Houston. The research was supported by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Center for Transportation, Environment and Community Health, and by Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology.
While previous studies have looked at certain facets of transportation innovation, such as the impact of electric vehicles on fuel usage and emissions, this is the first time anyone has employed a transdisciplinary systems approach that factored in human health and the associated economic benefits, according to Gao.
Gao’s systematics research group – which uses modeling to understand complex global challenges in engineering, business, societal well-being and sustainability – is uniquely positioned for such a task.
“A transportation engineer cannot address these questions,” Gao said. “Environmental science cannot address these questions. A health researcher cannot address these questions. However, this transdisciplinary group can do this.”
Pan, Fulton and Gao built an integrated assessment system that included a technical-economic mobility model, a chemical transport model and a health impact assessment tool. Then they projected the vehicle stocks, distance traveled, energy usage and carbon dioxide emissions in the continental U.S. through 2050, and quantified the impacts of changing emissions on concentrations of fine particulate matter in the atmosphere, as well as the ensuing health and economic benefits of populations in 10 major metropolitan areas.
Their simulations show that, depending on how widely the three “revolutions” are adopted, reductions in emissions from passenger travel could prevent between 2,300 and 8,100 premature deaths annually in the U.S. in 2050.
The largest number of prevented deaths coincided with large metropolitan areas, such as Los Angeles and Chicago. At the state level, California, Texas, New York, Ohio and Florida would see the largest decreases in premature mortality.
The associated economic benefits could range from $24 billion to $84 billion annually.
The study hangs on a number of assumptions and uncertainties. After all, driverless cars are not yet commercially available, and sales of electric vehicles lag far behind conventional gas guzzlers.
“Another key finding is that for carbon mitigations and health benefits, vehicle electrification is by far the most important piece, followed by shared mobility (ride-sharing) and then automation, ” Pan said. “The net energy impacts of self-driving vehicles are highly uncertain and automation alone may not dramatically affect energy use, emissions or vehicle-related pollution. ”
A complicating factor is that the efficiency improvement and projected cost reduction from automation could actually lead to increased travel and offset other gains.
“If we automate the vehicles, you might make the transportation system more efficient, but probably more people will travel longer distances,” Gao said. “So there is a balance, there is a trade-off.”
The study concludes that policymakers can help encourage the transition to electric vehicles and boost ride sharing, for example, by issuing tighter fuel economy standards, creating economic incentives for shared mobility and investing in charging infrastructure and technological developments.
A future of autonomous flying taxis
Of course, actually creating such transportation innovations is not possible without first determining their viability.
Another research project from Gao’s lab – published July 6 in Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice – explores the feasibility of an airport shuttle service that uses autonomous flying taxis as a means to mitigate urban congestion. The paper’s lead author is Emily Lewis ’20.
“While you are stuck in traffic from JFK [International Airport] to Manhattan, have you ever thought, oh, I wish I could be a bird, just to fly there. Actually, that dream is not too far away,” said Gao, who directs Cornell’s Center for Transportation, Environment and Community Health. “But how do you even architect a whole system, from the technology to market prediction and to operation? Would such an idea make economic sense at all?”
The study focuses on the concept of urban air mobility – essentially a transportation service for low-altitude airspace in metropolitan areas that features autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles.
Gao’s team – which included co-authors Jesse Ponnock ’20, Qamar Cherqaoui ’20, Scott Holmdahl ’20,Yus Johnson ’20 and Alfred Wong ’20 – focused on the three busiest airports in the U.S.: Atlanta, Los Angeles and Dallas.
They used a holistic, system-architecture analysis to identify each area’s key stakeholders and the goals that meet their needs, such as fleet management, infrastructure, traffic control, safety, user experience, financial viability and performance. The modeling also took into account the relationships between annual profit, mean time between safety incidents, upfront costs and the number of passengers shuttled per day.
“Because of its geographic, meteorological and also demand factors, Los Angeles turns out to be the best case for a pilot city,” Gao said.
The analysis identified wealthy commuters, long-distance commuters, business executives, event attendees, emergency transportation and vacationers as potential early adopters of an air mobility system.
What would such a system actually look like from a passenger’s perspective? It might not be too different from the ride-sharing services of today. The analysis recommended the system use FIFO (first in, first out) queuing and a smartphone interface for passengers, which may sound familiar to anyone who has ever hailed an Uber on their phone.
Also recommended: a hybrid energy source that incorporates electric energy for the autonomous vehicles.
But vehicles and apps are only part of it. For an air mobility system to become a reality, it would need the infrastructure to support it.
“This is not actually as mature as electrification or even automation,” Gao said. “This is even further away down the road. We are not comparing urban air mobility to other modes or arguing this is a better mode. We’re just saying that now, given the interest, first you need to be able to architect this. And then you will have a better sense about cost.”

Flying cars are almost a byword for the misplaced optimism of technologists, but recent news suggests their future may be on slightly firmer footing. The industry has seen a major influx of capital and big automakers seem to be piling in.
What actually constitutes a flying car has changed many times over the decades since the cartoon, The Jetsons, introduced the idea to the popular imagination. Today’s incarnation is known more formally as an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.
As the name suggests, the vehicles run on battery power rather than aviation fuel, and they’re able to take off and land like a helicopter. Designs vary from what are essentially gigantic multi-rotor drones to small fixed-wing aircraft with rotors that can tilt up or down, allowing them to hover or fly horizontally (like an airplane).
Aerospace companies and startups have been working on the idea for a number of years, but recent news suggests it might be coming closer to fruition. Last Monday, major automakers Hyundai and GM said they are developing vehicles of their own and are bullish about the prospects of this new mode of transport.
And the week prior, British flying car maker Vertical Aerospace announced plans to go public in a deal that values the company at $2.2 billion. Vertical Aerospace also said it had received $4 billion worth of preorders, including from American Airlines and Virgin Atlantic.
The deal was the latest installment in a flood of capital into the sector, with competitors Joby Aviation, Archer Aviation, and Lilium all recently announcing deals to go public too. Also joining them is Blade Urban Mobility, which currently operates heliports but plans to accommodate flying cars when they become available.
When exactly that will be is still uncertain, but there seems to be growing consensus that the second half of this decade might be a realistic prospect. Vertical is aiming to start deliveries by 2024. And the other startups, who already have impressive prototypes, are on a similar timeline.
Hyundai’s global chief operating officer, José Muñoz, told attendees at Reuters’ Car of the Future conference that the company is targeting a 2025 rollout of an air taxi service, while GM’s vice president of global innovation, Pamela Fletcher, went with a more cautious 2030 target. They’re not the only automakers getting in on the act, with Toyota, Daimler, and China’s Geely all developing vehicles alone or in partnership with startups.
Regulators also seem to be increasingly open to the idea.
In January, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced it expects to certify the first eVTOLs later this year and have regulations around their operation in place by 2023. And last month the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said it expected air taxi services to be running by 2024 or 2025.
While it seems fairly settled that the earliest flying cars will be taxis rather than private vehicles, a major outstanding question is the extent to which they will be automated.
The majority of prototypes currently rely on a human to pilot them. But earlier this month Larry Page’s air taxi startup Kitty Hawk announced it would buy drone maker 3D Robotics as it seeks to shift to a fully autonomous setup. The FAA recently created a new committee to draft a regulatory path for beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) autonomous drone flights. This would likely be a first step along the path to allowing unmanned passenger aircraft.
What seems more certain is that there will be winners and losers in the recent rush to corner the air mobility market. As Chris Bryant points out in Bloomberg, these companies still face a host of technological, regulatory, and social hurdles, and the huge amounts of money flooding into the sector may be hard to justify.
Regardless of which companies make it out the other side, it’s looking increasingly likely that air taxis will be a significant new player in urban transport by the end of the decade.

Autonomous vehicle technologies have been around for years. You can see some of them in machinery such as agriculture and paving equipment, as well as automobiles such as passenger vehicles and even heavy-duty trucks.
Back in 2016, a project known as the Colorado beer run showcased the possibilities of vehicle autonomy in the trucking industry. A human drove a tractor-trailer loaded with Budweiser beer onto I-25. The driver then put the truck into self-driving mode before retiring to the sleeper. That truck operated autonomously for roughly 3 hours and 130 miles, right down to the braking and turn signaling.
“Just from looking at this project, we know these types of technologies are already close to prime time,” said Dan Murray, senior vice president of the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI), keynote speaker at AEM’s recently held member education webinar on autonomous vehicles.
Widespread adoption is of course the ultimate goal, but companies need to prepare for the investments that are needed in their organizations and in our infrastructure.
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO ROI
ATRI has done extensive research in the area of autonomous vehicle technology adoption. Motor carriers and drivers share many of the same desires and concerns. At the top of the list are upfront investment and insurance premiums.
“Autonomous equipment has a high upfront cost,” Murray said. “It’s typical to spend $130,000 for a tractor today. But a tractor with autonomous technologies will easily cost $185,000 to $200,000. This means that, ultimately, the cost to transport goods is going to be higher. If a motor carrier can’t pass that cost onto its customer, what real benefit is in it for them?”
Something similar can be said about insurance premiums. According to Murray, an investment in autonomous technologies that make vehicles safer does not translate to reduced premiums. So again, the motor carrier or driver (owner/operator) sees no immediate financial benefit to making that investment.
“Additionally, trial lawyers are drooling over this environment,” Murray added. U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) data shows that roughly 89% of critical crash factors are associated with human factors. The remaining 11% are vehicle and component-related faults.
“With autonomous vehicles, it will probably be a flipflop,” Murray suggested. “You’ll likely see changes in the model of litigation, but litigation itself is not going away. There are some opportunities to improve safety with autonomous technologies, but do not assume litigation will go the way of the dinosaur.”
Another financial factor standing in the way of adoption is the fact that there will still be driver costs. The days of fully autonomous, driverless vehicles are far down the road. Plus, drivers still have a long list of inspection and reporting tasks that must be completed on a routine basis.
One other financial deterrent is the fact that no tax credits exist for autonomous technology investment — at least not yet.
“The good news is that the U.S. DOT may be contemplating tax credits for implementing some of these technologies,” Murray pointed out. “It’s hard to tell if Congress would ultimately end up authorizing such credits. But the fact that this is even being considered is a positive indication.”
6 MORE KEYS TO AUTONOMOUS ADOPTION
Driver acceptance is an adoption prerequisite identified by both motor carriers and drivers. In order to move toward widescale adoption, drivers must want them on the trucks, vans and other vehicles they are employed to operate. One in-road is that autonomous technology helps attract a new pool of potential drivers to the profession. As Murray noted, these high-tech cabs could appeal to younger, more tech-savvy individuals. That could go a long way toward helping solve the driver shortage issue that has been plaguing several industries.Weather can be a challenge for autonomous systems, especially when driving in the northern states where snow and ice can impede radar, lidar and camera systems. Rain and fog can have a crippling effect, too. “These systems will not be able to be used in northern environments for another 3 to 5 years, if not 10,” Murray speculated.Construction zones. Today’s popular autonomous technologies like radar and lidar can also be negatively impacted by construction zones. The larger the project and longer the duration, the bigger the impact.Inadequate infrastructure. Speaking of road construction projects, infrastructure in general is another challenge. Roadway defects like potholes and faded lane striping make it difficult to impossible for autonomous vehicles to operate.Traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is not friendly toward an autonomous vehicle. “Drivers don’t want all of those advanced warning systems going off nonstop as traffic congestion builds on both sides of the vehicle,” Murray said. “Most of these autonomous systems will be best used out on the open road, away from all of this urban congestion.” As e-commerce has exploded over the past year, a new opportunity for autonomy has emerged. More delivery fleets are venturing into suburban and rural areas. These represent the ideal applications for autonomous technologies to be deployed. This could help accelerate adoption.Murray said the federal government isn’t doing enough to advance the concept of autonomous delivery vehicles. Murray would like to see programs and regulations become standardized on a federal level so autonomous vehicles can better operate across state lines. “If you’re platooning in Minnesota, for instance, you’re allowed to have an 80-foot headway between the vehicles,” Murray explained. “When you get to Wisconsin, it drops to 40 feet. Once in Illinois, it goes back up to 65 feet. The poor driver can’t be pulling over at every state line to change the calibration of the vehicle’s sensors. If we don’t have a seamless interstate system, we won’t have a safe, efficient and productive autonomous transportation system.”
OFF-ROAD AUTONOMOUS APPLICATIONS
While challenges may stand in the way of widespread adoption of autonomous vehicle technologies, they have been making their mark in off-road applications for several years now.
The first autonomous testing began in Japan in 1990. However, the process actually began with the release of the Field Management Software (FMS) for mines in the late 1980s, and it drove the subsequent development of Komatsu’s autonomous platform.
The inaugural commercial deployment took place in Chile in 2007, and a second system was launched a year later at a Western Australia-based iron ore mining operation. Finally, in 2013, Komatsu introduced the world’s first dozer with fully automatic blade control.
The lessons learned from those efforts eventually led to the first North American deployment in 2016. By 2018, Komatsu had moved over 2 billion tons, with 130 fully autonomous mining trucks running across seven operational sites (six of which are fully autonomous sites). As of June 2020, the numbers jumped to to 3 billion tons moved by 251 trucks, and the fleet still maintained a perfect safety record with no incidents as of that time.
Caterpillar has also embraced autonomous vehicle technologies. The company had 276 autonomous trucks in operation have driven over 42 million miles without a lost-time injury, as of late 2020. In addition, Caterpillar has doubled the amount it has hauled autonomously since reaching the 1 billion-ton mark in November of 2018.
As of late 2020, autonomous vehicles held a market share of less than 1% of total construction equipment sales worldwide. However, given global equipment sales are projected to grow 2.5% each year until 2022, coupled with the exponential growth in adoption of AVs, the market share is expected to double in size in the next couple of years.
Autonomous heavy haulers are already in use in mining in several countries, with automated agricultural and forestry equipment currently being developed as well. While a combination of GPS and other location tracking sensors, image sensors and telematics assist John Deere vehicles to navigate fields today, the company still can’t truly replicate everything a human would see and feel sitting in the tractor cab. The determining factors here are farmer perception and added value. This will remain the case until more tasks, and not just movement, become automated.
Meanwhile, the forestry sector has seen limited progress with automation, largely due to working conditions being over considerably larger areas than those experienced by the other sectors. Work sites are often in remote areas, on steep slopes, and in very rugged and variable terrain. In these remote areas, there are generally no cell towers and no Wi-Fi, and communication is currently expensive with limited bandwidth. The next generation of very large fleets of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, however, is expected to address this problem.
In addition, construction contractors are applying self-driving machinery to do repetitive tasks, such as pouring concrete, bricklaying, welding and even demolition. Excavation and other prep work is also being completed by autonomous or semi-autonomous bulldozers, which can ready a jobsite with the help of a human programmer to exact specifications.
TECHNOLOGIES BEING ADOPTED
Differential GPS represents one of the more promising autonomous technologies today, according to Murray. Consider the fact that GPS on the typical smartphone is fairly accurate with a resolution of roughly 10 feet. “You can’t see what lane you’re in, but you can certainly see what road you’re on,” Murray said. “With differential GPS, a correction signal gets you down to just a couple of centimeters. If you add that to an autonomous system, you suddenly have an all-weather fighter, which is really important in northern states.”
Murray is especially excited about camera monitoring systems. “The U.S. DOT has exempted side-view mirrors on trucks and large vehicles if you have video mirrors,” Murray said. “Not only does that technology give drivers a wider field of view and improved safety, but a vehicle can also get 1-2% fuel economy benefit by removing the big, obsolete side-view mirrors.”
As Murray noted, most tractor-trailers in operation today do not employ ADAS technologies, but the list is as follows (Below percentages are approximate.)
Adaptive steering control – 92%Camera-based mirror system – 90%Active lane centering assist – 90%Active lane keep assist – 85%Driver-facing camera – 82%Blind spot warning – 80%Auto emergency braking – 70%Lane departure warning – 70%Forward collision warning – 62%Adaptive cruise control – 62%
ATRI recently completed an extensive study where motor carriers and drivers were asked which technologies they wanted to consider adopting. Automated emergency braking topped the list at 16%, followed closely by forward collision warning and road-facing cameras at 14%. Lane detection warning was cited by roughly 10% of those surveyed.
There is an important distinction to be made regarding motor carrier attitudes vs. driver attitudes.
“While the motor carriers are pretty excited about many of these systems, that’s not so much the case with the drivers,” Murray pointed out. Many tractor-trailer drivers are in their mid-40s or older. This demographic tends to be extra cautious where technology is concerned. Some are even downright cynical.
“There is a lot of education, promotion and awareness that needs to happen in order to convince drivers that these technologies are not going to put them out of a job,” Murray said. “These technologies are just going to make the driver experience easier, better and safer.”
Both drivers and motor carriers also need a little convincing where investment and ROI are concerned. If some of those hurdles could be cleared, autonomous adoption could accelerate in coming years.

According to the United Nations, the world’s population continues to rise. By 2050, it is expected to increase by 2 billion to reach 9.7 billion. Around 2100, it could peak at nearly 11 billion. Currently, about 55 percent of the world’s population lives in cities; in the coming 30 years, this percentage will reach 68%. This means more pressure on the world’s cities to provide better sustainability management, resource utilization, and urban areas development.
The solution lies in smarter cities.
What Is a Smart City?
Smart cities use IoT devices to collect and analyze data and allow automation and tasks to be carried out without human intervention. Diverse IoT devices are connected and communicate for different tasks.
Cities use the information collected to improve infrastructure, public utilities, services, and more. Smart cities are more efficient and safe to live in, providing a higher quality lifestyle for their residents.
The Growth of IoT
IoT is set to grow into one of the smartest collective and collaborative systems in history. According to numbers from the “Improving Internet of Things (IoT) Security with Software-Defined Network (SDN)” study, there will be more than 75.44 billion connected IoT devices by 2025, over 7.33 billion mobile users by 2023, and more than 1,105 million connected wearable devices users by 2022.IoT-enabled smart cities offer a solution to many of our population-related social problems. Take a deeper look at the solutions a smart city provides.Click To Tweet
What does it mean to be a smart city? Already, the overall value of worldwide deals related to smart cities between the first quarter of 2019 and the last quarter of 2020 totaled $17.24 billion. This represents a 123.48 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase. Different sectors of smart cities include:
Smart homes: Residences containing devices connected to the internet. Devices such as lights, fridges, and televisions communicate with each other and share data to users.Smart healthcare: Wearable and nonwearable devices that can monitor and measure the activities of user health, measuring temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugar, and many other factors.Smart environment: Intelligent sensors installed for the development of city infrastructure. These sensors control and monitor the conditions of the surroundings (such as air quality and lighting) to provide a healthier environment.Smart transportation: Optimized services and innovative devices enhance city transportation. These services can include smart parking, traffic flow, number plate recognition, supply chain management and so on.Smart surveillance: A diverse array of security and surveillance devices are installed around the city to prevent incidents from occurring and for quick action in case of an emergency.
According to a study by IoT Analytics, smart cities prioritize IoT technology in several interesting ways. The top priorities among decision-makers from some of the world’s leading smart cities are:
Connected public transport (74%)Traffic monitoring and management (72%)Water level / flood monitoring (72%)Video surveillance and analytics (72%)Connected streetlights (68%)Weather monitoring (68%)Air quality / Pollution monitoring (68%)Smart metering – water (66%)Fire / smoke detection (66%)Water quality monitoring (64%)
Let’s take a look at these smart city applications in more detail.
Public Transport
Key goals of any city’s public transport system include greater efficiency and reliability. Smart technology is key to enabling just this. For example, the Polish city of Lublin implemented an innovative passenger information system for connected public transport that revolutionized the city’s bus transit system. Smart devices were installed on vehicles to transmit real-time data to a dispatch center software. This software then relays that information to electronic displays at bus stops and online portals to inform users of the real-time status of their transport options.
Traffic Monitoring
Managing traffic flow is one of the biggest challenges for today’s cities. Smart city devices can ease traffic pain points and improve safety. In Los Angeles, the government installed a network of sensors that transmit real-time traffic updates to a traffic management platform. The platform then adjusts the timing of traffic signals to optimize traffic flow.
Water Level Monitoring
Especially with the real impacts of climate change and urban sprawl, flooding has become a problem in cities worldwide. Smart sensors installed in key areas can detect water levels and report flooding incidents or potential flooding incidents in real-time.
Smart Video Surveillance
Smart video surveillance has been around for a long time, and these cameras are commonly used to police the world’s roads and highways. ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras are also commonly used by law enforcement to identify stolen cars, enforce traffic control, collect tolls and deter crime. Today’s smart video surveillance cameras work within an integrated security system to predict crimes before they even happen.
Connected Streetlights
Connected streetlights and lighting solutions have many benefits, including reducing energy consumption and costs, reducing maintenance costs, increased public safety, safer traffic, and measurable environmental impact. Today’s smart streetlights can also double up as EV chargers and monitor emissions and serve as wireless broadband connection points.
Weather Monitoring

Smart, real-time, and predictive weather monitoring helps city management predict and manage weather disruptions and severe weather events.
Snow forecasting could be help cities assess where best to station their snowplows (as well as assess the maintenance status and availability of snowplows). Determining where extra cooling may be required (especially for senior citizens or disabled residents). Micro-forecasts of rain, fog, and snow could be linked to accident data to predict and prevent the likelihood of traffic accidents. Wind and temperature data allows first responders to plan where best to position firefighters to deal with a wildfire.
Air Quality Monitoring
Smart cities aim to provide a decent quality of life to their citizens by offering a clean and sustainable environment. Air quality monitoring helps city management to identify and mitigate the sources of pollution. Using a network of low-cost air quality monitoring sensors, the city can detect sources of pollution and take corrective measures to improve the city’s environmental health.
Smart Metering
The smart meter or automated meter reader is a top IoT device among utility companies. These devices attach to or replace traditional utility meters to provide real-time consumption data, allowing the utility companies to manage energy flow more effectively. This includes identifying and implementing resource efficiencies for a lower carbon footprint.
Fire and Smoke Detection
Having fire and smoke detectors around a city improves emergency management and preparedness. Smart fire and smoke detection sensors provide real-time information about the direction, location, or magnitude. The prediction and early detection of fire and smoke in smart cities can reduce large-scale damage and improve public safety significantly, in addition to warning city management, mass warning systems that can provide emergency alerts to the city’s population.
Water Quality Monitoring
Water hygiene is a crucial aspect of city safety. One of the ways that water safety is enabled through smart technology is with an automated Legionella compliance system, which automates the process of Legionella management and compliance. Instead of manually taking readings of every water outlet, the system takes the temperature of the water and flushes the system at regular intervals. Automated reporting and record-keeping saves time and ensures accuracy.
It’s time for cities to graduate to a smarter solution.
Connected smart city devices make everyday tasks easier and more efficient while relieving pain points related to public safety, traffic, and environmental issues. To make smart cities viable, the technology needs to be scalable, affordable, secure, and easy to deploy. Smarter Technologies’ Orion Data Network ticks all the boxes, helping cities worldwide become safer, cleaner, and better places to live for the world’s growing population.

 In this special guest feature, Gilad Avrashi, CTO & Co-Founder at MDgo, believes that now is the time for the insurance industry to leverage AI technology to unlock the power of data and provide personalized services that customers demand to retain them as loyal customers. 

Data is transforming the way we live and how consumers engage with service providers. Most industries are using data to personalize offerings for customers and provide real-time expertise to strengthen relationships while gaining consumer trust. We are seeing this with Netflix making personalized movie recommendations based on the viewer’s specific interests and history. Now is the time for the insurance industry to leverage AI technology to unlock the power of data and provide personalized services that customers demand to retain them as loyal customers.
In addition to leveraging data for personalized services, insurance providers must compete on price to retain today’s customers. AI technology gives insurers the data needed to streamline the claims process, while reducing costs to pass savings off to customers. Leveraging data from advanced technologies to better understand drivers and accidents drives customer retention, brand loyalty and savings.
Despite the obvious benefits of leveraging data, very few insurers currently do it, creating gaps between their capabilities and customers’ immediate needs and expectations. For instance, according to the OECD, 44% of car crash fatalities could have been prevented if real-time data on the type and severity of their injuries were available for emergency medical services and treating hospitals. Indeed, AI technology has the power to uncover real-time insights from car accidents including occupants’ injuries and vehicle damage, providing lifesaving information to medical teams.
Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, ADR technology (Accident Detection and Response) can analyze the crash pulse recorded by vehicle telematics devices and virtual sensors to provide detailed reports. Beyond life-saving capabilities, AI can provide personalized services to drivers, such as automatically recommending a tow truck or autobody shop after an accident, as well as other location-based associated services.
ADR, powered by AI technology and machine learning capabilities, has huge potential for data applications in the insurance industry, and here’s a bit about how it works, beginning from the moment a crash occurs.
Gain access crash and injury data powered by machine learning
ADR’s initial, and potentially most significant, application of AI is to extrapolate crash test data to better understand and predict the connection between vehicle acceleration (or deceleration) and potential injuries. Advanced machine learning algorithms are used in tandem with physical sensor devices installed in the vehicle to accurately detect crashes as they happen. In order to address one of the most significant pain points of insurers, i.e. accurate and real time first notice of loss, which is driven by a low false negative and false positive rate. 
The physical sensor “wakes up” when it senses a shift in the vehicle’s acceleration, guaranteeing that no event goes undetected and lowering the false negative rate. Then, machine learning algorithms gain a complete picture of the crash, which makes it possible to remove the possibility of false positives. Finally, once a crash is detected, the damage and injury insights are provided using deep learning models, making it possible to deliver insurers detailed crash reports in real-time.
How is this done, you might ask? That’s where the concept of ADR’s unique virtual sensors come into the picture. Using cutting-edge deep learning networks, vehicle motion sensor readings are translated into virtual sensors, or a grid of dozens of sensors that are usually set up to determine potential vehicle damages and occupant injuries in crash test scenarios, such as those conducted by automotive OEMs.
 These sensors are virtually placed in and around the vehicle and its occupants, thereby emulating a world where you potentially walk around with an accelerometer inside of your head to assess potential injuries, without ever having to install any additional hardware. This imaginary “hardware” or virtual sensors makes it possible to determine where an occupant involved in a crash has been injured – delivering this information both to their insurer and, more importantly, to first responders and medical personnel.
Finally, each crash is identified by a unique crash pulse, which is used as its fingerprint. Machine learning algorithms analyze the fingerprint and construct a full crash profile, which is then translated into accurate damage and injury insights, providing an objective view of the accident. Access to these detailed data could decrease costs for insurance providers as gain access to a complete picture of a crash and its immediate consequences for the occupants.
Making the delivery of personalized services and care for policyholders possible
Beyond lifesaving capabilities, AI can automatically assist drivers in the recovery process following an accident. Having crash data readily available allows insurers to automatically make recommendations for recovery. Imagine receiving a message from your provider immediately after a wreck letting you know a tow truck is on the way and directing you to the nearest autobody shop. These types of personalized automated engagements are possible with robust data collection and processing beginning at the moment of impact.  
An objective view of accident data is a critical and hitherto limited area of visibility for the auto insurance industry. ADR removes uncertainties by detailing the accident journey in data-driven reports for the insurer. Personalizing recommendations based on data could save insurers money during the claims process as they guide customers to supported garages and gain a clear picture of the accident the moment it occurs, which also delivers personalization value.
In all, AI has immense potential to transform the insurance industry as we know it. We’re about to witness a true top-down shift, be it from offering tailored, personalized services that begin at the moment of impact, to reducing claim costs for insurers by directing policyholders to engage with an affiliated network of services (i.e. DRP body shops and tow trucks). These capabilities and more are made possible with ADR’s real-time sensor data and custom-built AI algorithms, delivering fully objective reports with zero human intervention that help insurers deliver unique life and cost-saving value for policyholders.

South Africa’s economy is easing back towards levels of activity last seen before the Covid-19 lockdown. Logistics fleets are returning to full capacity, and private travel is now similarly back to previous levels.
The reason we can confidently make this assertion is the vast amounts of data now available to us about movement on South African roads. As an operator in the vehicle recovery and fleet management space, we have access to this data.
This data now informs pivotal strategic decisions, it drives business planning, efficiency enhancements, and life-and-death safety initiatives. The source of this vast ocean of information is that popular current buzzword – the Internet of Things (IoT).
IoT technology has been around for decades – even if its name is more recent. Tracking and monitoring devices have long been in use – employing radio and satellite methodology, and later 3G and LTE platforms.
The move towards the mass, high-speed connectivity promised by 5G mobile broadband promises to take the industry to a new level of insight, providing critical data that vastly improves customer services, safety, and profitability.
No longer are IoT insights a nice-to-have capability, or simply a security concern. They are vital. No business operating in the mobility space can afford to ignore the value of IoT.
IoT finds application in several aspects of modern business. In public transport, for instance, camera technology is now used to monitor driver behaviour as well as social-distancing and safety compliance.
Newer-generation cameras are capable of image recognition, customer counts and even remote infrared body-temperature screening.
Initially, short-range RF technology simply told customers the location of their vehicles. As the technology progressed, we were able to gather more information through GPS trackers, cameras and ever more precise sensors.
Today, companies can assess and modify driving behaviour. This has opened up opportunities for both consumers as well as insurers and vehicle finance companies. They can now offer personalised premiums and encourage efficient, safe driving that benefits drivers, businesses and society at large.
We have seen our offering evolve from tracking to connectivity and data management. Technology also now lets us give clients access to data platforms and dashboards where they can manage and customise their own track-and-trace service.
Clients can also now take ownership of their own security, setting geofencing and alert parameters for their vehicles and family members.
Commercial transport firms can set up automated logbooks, panic buttons and driver alerts.
In the consumer space, the next step of technological evolution is the understanding of the car as a permanently connected information and entertainment hub.
When the connected car can guarantee broadband access, the final piece of the puzzle falls into place. We can now move seamlessly between our home, vehicle and office environments while remaining connected throughout. This is the dawn of the Connected Life.
Thanks to IoT, this state of eternal connectivity generates constant, exponentially growing amounts of data. The challenge, and the true differentiator in an IoT space where equipment is largely commoditised, is how to use and interpret that information.
Data enrichment is the new frontier. A company such as ours has moved from simple vehicle tracking, into the Big Data space. We have built our own Big Data platform, in partnership with Stellenbosch University, which we launched about two years ago. The platform currently processes around 300 million data points per day.
Big Data platforms allow for the provision of data-centric services such as predictive models. For instance, insurance companies can now use drivers’ unique biometric data-sets to identify when performance is impaired due to fatigue or alcohol. In this way, IoT enables the evolution from accident reconstruction to accident prevention, using the power of data.
As far as claims validation goes, data analysis powered by artificial intelligence can make this an almost instantaneous process. 
Another trend we are seeing is OEMs entering the data and connectivity space. While this transition has not yet reached its ultimate form, based on our global partnerships with Toyota, we anticipate carmakers taking ownership of engine- and vehicle-centric information and its connectivity.
Supplementary services, such as theft recovery, and jamming detection will likely be provided by local suppliers. With the rise of the connected vehicle, infotainment will become another differentiator, and possibly another income stream for OEMs, or third-party suppliers.
The final stage of this data-centric move to connected mobility may be the establishment of a single, interoperable data platform, shared by cars, infrastructure, service providers and governments. Until such a scenario arrives, we will see connectivity gradually gaining in significance as the key enabler of movement.
It must not be overlooked that these oceans of data that our mobility now generates come with significant security risks. Cybersecurity is now a mobility issue, and we’ll need to keep building technologies and policies to protect our customers and their data.
The key is proactive threat management, using artificial intelligence to proactively anticipate and manage such threats on a dedicated cybersecurity platform.
IoT is the technology that has transformed modern business. That transformation is taking place in several spaces at once – safety, mobility, accessibility, sustainability, cost control, operations, information and analytics.
Each of these areas offers opportunities for organisations able to build proficiencies themselves, or to build partnerships to provide such services. In an emerging platform economy, where data is ubiquitous, the organizations with the platforms to deliver services using that data will dominate.
Technology is no longer a differentiator, but an enabler. It enables the objectives and strategies of organizations, so they can serve their customers and be competitive. As such, it is indispensable. IoT, overlaid with AI, is no longer a grudge purchase. It’s essential.

After a number of deaths in the US linked to Tesla owners placing too much faith in autonomous driving systems – and amid ongoing investigations by road safety regulators there – Elon Musk says mastering the tech is more difficult than he expected.
Tesla boss Elon Musk has finally admitted what many automotive industry experts have long realised: autonomous vehicle technology is a lot more difficult than it seems, due to the countless variables a car must learn, detect, and avoid while on the move.
In addition to being able to detect lanes, other vehicles, traffic signals and pedestrian movement, fully autonomous cars must learn to pre-empt the behaviour of other drivers and pedestrians in the same way a human would, an almost impossible task.
On social media platform Twitter this week – in response to a query about Tesla’s next update on autonomous tech – Elon Musk wrote: “FSD 9 (Full Self Driving 9) beta is shipping soon I swear! Generalized (autonomous) self-driving is a hard problem, as it requires solving a large part of real-world AI (artificial intelligence).
“Didn’t expect it to be so hard, but the difficulty is obvious in retrospect. Nothing has more degrees of freedom than reality.”
The admission by Elon Musk is being regarded as a relief to industry observers, as car companies have grappled with the roll-out of the technology and, in the US at least, regulators are increasingly keeping a close eye on real-world driving tests of the future tech.
In October 2017 a high-ranking autonomous vehicle expert at US car giant General Motors said Tesla’s claim that it already had the technology for total hands-free driving was “full of crap”.
At the time, Elon Musk said Tesla cars “already have the hardware needed for a full self-driving capability”, known in the industry as a “Level Five” engineering standard.
However in a briefing with Australian media in Detroit at the time, Scott Miller, General Motors’ director of autonomous vehicle integration said: “I think he’s full of crap”, when asked what he thought about Musk’s claim.
“If you think you can see everything you need for a Level Five autonomous (car) with cameras and radar, I don’t know how you do that,” Mr Miller told media in October 2017.
“To be what an SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) Level Five full autonomous system is, I don’t think he (Elon Musk) has the content to do that. Do you really want to trust one sensor measuring the speed of a car coming into an intersection before you pull out? I think you need some confirmation.”
The car industry is now of the view each sensor in an autonomous vehicle needs confirmation from one or more other sensors before making a critical decision, which adds cost and requires phenomenal processing speeds not seen before in automobiles.
While not backing away from his push for autonomous cars, it appears Musk is developing a more level-headed approach to the technology, especially in the wake of fatalities in the US involving Tesla drivers that placed way too much reliance on the self-driving systems.
In a YouTube interview with US automotive industry expert Sandy Munro in February 2021, Musk said: “For self-driving (technology), even if the road is painted completely wrong and a UFO lands in the middle of the road, the car still cannot crash and still needs to do the right thing.”
He continued: “The prime directive for the autopilot system is ‘don’t crash’. That really over-rides everything, no many what the lines say or how the road is done … minimise the probability of impact while getting you to your destination conveniently and comfortably.
Musk said at the time while it would “certainly be helpful to have roads with accurate markings” the car needs to be smarter than that.
“For self-driving, it’s got to be even if someone tries to trick the car (that) they do not succeed in tricking the car, because people will do weird things, it’s got to be maintain safety no matter what … don’t let yourself (Tesla autonomous tech) get tricked.”

Time loss due to traffic jams, rising levels of environmental pollution, an increasing number of fatalities, some of the many woes of urban commuting. Enter smart mobility, a solution based on the use of different modes of transportation instead of one’s personal vehicle. This concept, which runs on the use of carpooling, ridesharing, and bike commuting, has taken cities by storm. Not only that, this market is expected to grow further still though things have been going a little downhill since the advent of the pandemic.
Impact of COVID-19 on the Smart Mobility Market: An Analysis
2020 has been a grim year for all industrial sectors, especially the smart mobility market. The primary reason for the downfall of the smart mobility market can be attributed to a decline in demand for carpooling and ridesharing services across the world, owing to safety concerns.
While it is true that the market is expected to experience even slower growth during 2021, industry experts expect to see the curve rising from the year 2022 onwards. This forecast is based on the belief that adequate safety measures will be introduced for carpooling and ridesharing, such as the placement of plastic barriers between the car’s driver and its passengers.
Factors Affecting the Growth of Smart Mobility
The application of electricity to transportation and the use of carpooling are not novel concepts. In fact, the first Electric Vehicle (EV) was introduced in the US as early as 1889, and by the early 1900s, nearly one-third of the vehicles on the American streets were electricity-powered. It was not until the 1930s that cheap Texas oil made EVs a thing of the past. However, here we stand at the cusp of another golden age wherein EVs and smart mobility are bound to become an essential part of the future.
Having said that, it is natural for one to ask about the significant factors influencing the smart mobility market. The factors may either be drivers or barriers that need to be dealt with the innovation and a common purpose to turn the idea of smart mobility into a living reality.
#1 The Way People Viewed Vehicles are Changing
It was only a few decades back that owning a private car was every family’s dream. Mass production of automobiles and budget-friendly fuel prices brought this ideal within the reach of the average citizen, and as a result, vehicle-centric urban design and personal, door-to-door transportation became the norm.
Today, the scenario is much different. The present millennial-led era prefers not to own a car; instead, this young generation of commuters is shifting in favor of ridesharing services such as Uber or Lyft – they prefer to subscribe to a car-sharing service rather than bear the cost of a personal car, which includes fuel and maintenance costs. Is it any surprise that such new vehicle usage patterns will encourage the growth of the smart mobility market?
#2 Technology is Advancing at a Lightning-Fast Pace
From autonomous vehicles that are smart enough to run on their own to smart parking systems that make the tedious task of parking a piece of cake, technology is the key driver of the smart mobility market. The hyper-connectivity offered by the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G will make it easier for cities to manage traffic, cut down environmental pollution, and make better use of infrastructure. Commuters can have real-time information for smoother and safer transit.
Then, with the use of self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles and drone deliveries, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) predicts that the world may see a whopping 90% reduction in traffic deaths, a 40% reduction in travel time, and a 500% increase in lane capacity. Does it get any smarter than this!
#3 Low Rate of Internet Penetration in Developing Regions
Here’s a barrier to entry for smart mobility systems in full force. Now, the use of ridesharing services requires the involvement of three parties, namely the rider, the driver, and the service provider. The entire process of matching riders with drivers, fare estimation and ride payment are to be carried out via smartphone apps, which in turn require good internet connectivity.
 Unfortunately, some regions, such as Burundi, Chad, and Somalia, among others, have extremely low internet penetration that hinders the development of smart mobility systems in such countries. Once the proper infrastructure for connectivity has been established, the dream of smart mobility can proceed onwards.
#4 An Entirely New Infrastructure and Value Chain is Needed
As much as IoT requires proper infrastructure for connectivity, so does the use of Electric Vehicles require ubiquitous charging infrastructure. The current scenario is pretty awkward wherein potential EV drivers do not see an infrastructure that allows them to buy an EV and drive with confidence, and on the other hand, potential infrastructure providers do not see mass demand insight. Until the time charging stations become as common as gas stations are today, this one barrier-to-entry will make the adoption of EVs a far-fetched dream.
#5 Another Major Driver is Government Policies
Central, state, and city governments can join hands to speed up the adoption of smart mobility systems. Although several US state governments have already directed their focus towards measures such as tax credits and rebates to make smart mobility more affordable for early adopters and are also imposing strict vehicle emission standards for automobile manufacturers, the need of the hour is to offer exclusive EV parking in congested areas, and establishment of ZEZs or Zero Emission Zones wherein traffic will be restricted to bikes, pedestrians, delivery vehicles, and electric vehicles – measures already in place by the city governments of London, Brussels, Paris, and Madrid. Such government policies are sure to accelerate the growth of the smart mobility market.
Top Companies Expected to Dominate the Smart Mobility Market
To create technologically evolved smart mobility solutions, companies need to come up with products that are developed from a long-term market perspective as opposed to short-term creations. This is because as the smart mobility market is set in stone and matures, consumers will naturally demand integrated solutions – a mix of travel services with ancillary services.
As of now, the following companies are expected to take the lead in the future smart mobility market –
CiscoMaaS Global OySiemensTomTom InternationalInnoviz Technologies Inc.Toyota Motor CorporationFord Motor Company, among others.
Despite its present sluggish growth, smart mobility will be a factor in customer preference, changing the way people travel. It’s only a matter of time before this service model comes to the mainstream, and come it will, reaching its projected growth of $70.46 billion by the year 2027.

Five years ago, the expectation was that by 2020 the sight of ‘robotaxis’ and autonomous driverless trucks would be a common sight on our streets. 
Their absence today shows that tech and transport industries have woken up to the fact that creating autonomous vehicles — capable of safely dealing with mixed traffic and hundreds of other variables — is a bigger technical challenge than first imagined. 
Although expectations have been reset to a more reasonable timeframe, the speed of development is still terrific, and the prize for success is access to a multi-billion dollar market.  
“For autonomous driving to take off on-highway we need three things to happen,” said Nils Jaeger, president of Volvo Autonomous Solutions.
“We need to master the technology – especially of perception systems that allow vehicles to travel at high speeds. Secondly, we need society to trust us when we say this new tech is beneficial, and finally we need legislators to adapt laws to give autonomous vehicles access to the highways. It’s a puzzle and we need all the pieces to fall into place.”
While robotaxis are still on the industry’s wish list, the first on-road application for autonomous driving is likely to be in trucking, especially of the hub-to-hub type found in the United States’ interstate highway system.
“As the Volvo Group is one of the world’s largest truck manufacturers, we are putting a lot of effort into solving this problem and developing a credible offering,” Jaeger said. “The creation of Volvo Autonomous Solutions is a clear statement of intent that we want to be a leader in this field.”
Off-highway reality 
Autonomous vehicles may be applicable to on-road yet, but in the confined areas of off-road, autonomous driving technology is mature enough to offer credible alternatives. For off-road, Volvo Autonomous Solutions is focusing on two industry segments, ports and logistics centres, and light mines and quarries.  
Volvo Autonomous Solutions is perhaps unique in its ability to offer automated solutions for both on and off road. With truck and construction divisions within the Volvo Group to source equipment from, and partnerships with Silicon Valley companies and AI leaders to develop autonomous driving architecture.
The company has already developed the TA-15 autonomous quarry hauler solution. It runs on a battery-electric drivetrain and uses GNSS, lidar, radar and multiple sensors. Being selfdriving, the TA-15 has no need for a cabin – making for a dramatically new machine profile. 
“Our approach is to start small, in a tightly confined environment and build on our successes over time,” Jaeger said. “Ports, quarries and light mines fit this profile, as they have clearly defined load-and-drop locations, over generally short circuits. And with carefully mapped out safety plans, there is no need for regulatory changes.” 
Based at Volvo’s Camp X innovation hub in Gothenburg, Sweden, the 51-year-old Jaeger took up his role in the newly formed Volvo Autonomous Solutions on Jan. 1, 2020.
Previously spending 17 years of his career in the agricultural equipment sector, he is no stranger to automated systems. He witnessed first hand the arrival of autonomous steering systems for tractors and harvesting machines, tech that is now embedded in the sector. 
“I’m absolutely convinced that autonomous solutions are beneficial to society,” he said. “This new industry will provide a lot of value – safety, efficiency, flexibility, sustainability and economic. It is impossible to stop progress – this technology is going to happen – and I firmly believe that it will be a force for good. In fact, if we had been further ahead in our development the impact of COVID-19 would have been less.”
When challenged on fears of autonomous machines taking human operator jobs, Jaeger explained “there are already shortages of drivers in many markets, and human operators will continue to be in demand for many years to come.
“Far from being a threat, autonomous vehicles will be complimentary, doing jobs more safely than humans can, such as very long distance highway driving, or removing humans from worksite applications in hazardous areas, such as blast furnaces, unstable demolition sites or underground mines. As with the creation of the car or the computer, this technology will for sure be a creator of many new jobs.”
What about the fear that some people have about driverless vehicles being let loose on highways and work sites? 
“Fear is never a good advisor, so as an industry we need to come together and address those concerns,” Jaeger said.
“Not only must autonomous solutions be safe, we must demonstrate it unequivocally to reassure the public. That’s not just product safety, but also protection against cybercrime interference, which we are also working hard on preventing. The irony here is that one of the biggest benefits of this technology is that it will improve safety and reduce harm. There is already a healthy debate going on, and we need to be better at spelling out that key benefit.”
Transport as a service
Autonomous vehicles offer more than a like-for-like switch with human operated machines, but rather whole new business models and customer relationships. 
Transport as a service is a growing trend, and tailoring fleets of machines to suit customers’ individual needs is a key element of Volvo Autonomous Solutions’ remit. 
“We see ourselves as an integrator of emerging technologies to create solutions, bundling hardware and software, and then if necessary, operating it on behalf of the customer,” Jaeger said.
Autonomous vehicles will be a service to wider society. There remains several mountains to climb before reaching the goal of reliable, productive, sustainable and safe autonomous transport solutions. But Jaeger remains undaunted.
“To ensure that it is understood as beneficial to society we need to master the componentry by proving that it is truly safe,” he said. 
“We also need to reassure legislators and promote the many benefits by being good stewards of this technology.”

“Autonomous cars will be here in 2 years” has been a standard sentence from the industry for the past 5 years or so. Now there is good reason to expect autonomous ride-hailing services to hit our roads within 3 years. So, what has happened in the last year in the world of autonomy to give this confidence boost?
 Well, a few things actually. Breaking the previous year down into the most significant advancements: COVID-19 has kick-started the next phase of autonomous testing, technology maturity continues to more than double year on year, sensor prices are coming down and performance is increasing, and there are genuine autonomous services available, just in very limited conditions. To mark Autonomous Vehicle Day, observed on May 31, this article examines progress in more detail.
The impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly had a devastating impact on the world over the past year or so. However, opportunity can often be found in the face of adversity, and this was the case for autonomy. At the beginning of the pandemic, the companies that had been testing autonomous services with safety/backup drivers behind the wheel (Waymo, Cruise, Baidu, Pony, etc.) were forced to cease testing. 
There was concern about the social contact between the riders and the safety drivers being a factor in spreading the pandemic. Here is where the opportunity was presented; it seemed that the safest way to continue testing was without the safety driver behind the wheel. In July 2020, AutoX became the first MaaS company1 to gain a driverless testing license, a world-first which allowed them to operate driverless vehicles in California. The new license type allowed them to operate a fully autonomous service in San Jose, limited to roads with a posted speed limit of 45mph or less. 
Following that, another six companies have been granted similar licenses in California and others have gained similar licenses for parts of China. COVID-19 may have been the catalyst needed to transition from safety-driver-based testing to fully autonomous testing. This is not to say that the industry was not ready for the transition, but the pandemic definitely put pressure on the governing bodies to progress to the next step.
Technology maturity
MaaS operators have been testing their autonomous solutions in California since 2015, and since then they have been publishing reports about the performance of their systems. The most important outcome from this data is the miles per disengagement metric, which describes the average distance an autonomous vehicle can travel without human intervention. IDTechEx‘s analysis of this data shows exponential growth in the miles per disengagement, with the figure more than doubling each year. 
By extrapolating this growth IDTechEx predicts that within 3 years autonomous vehicles will be performing more safely than the average American driver. IDTechEx even went one step further and found that within 25 years autonomous vehicles will be able to travel the same annual distance as the entire US fleet without a single disengagement. There are still obstacles to overcome, such as testing in more urbanized areas and the establishment of cost-effective sensor suites. Waymo and Cruise have recently gained permission to test in the urban centers of San Francisco which will help with the former.

The Polish micro-mobility operator launches its first e-bike sharing service from the city of Rzeszów, using smart vehicles designed and manufactured by the Italian company.
Polish micro-mobility operator Blinkee chooses VAIMOO smart e-bikes to debut its first shared e-bike service.
Blinkee, operating in 47 cities and 5 European countries with over 6,000 vehicles including moped, scooters and traditional bikes, launches its first e-bike sharing service with VAIMOO starting with a pilot project from the municipality of Rzeszów to be then extended to other Poland urban centers.
More in detail, the partnership between Blinkee and VAIMOO includes a first supply of smart e-bikes, fully developed and manufactured by the Italian company and equipped with connectivity technology that allows vehicles to be easily integrated with the management system of the Polish operator, which delivers in one APP fully electric mopeds, scooters and bicycles.
This operation will allow Blinkee to expand the current fleet of vehicles in full coherence with its strategy of delivering a multimodal offer, using the state-of-the-art e-bikes for sharing, already awarded at CES 2021 – Consumer Electronic Show, and perfectly integrable in a simple and fast way.
An important partnership that strengthens the international presence of VAIMOO and that, after the agreements and implementations in Copenhagen, Rotterdam and in the UK, confirms once again the validity of its highly innovative e-bikes and system, able to exploit the full potential of IoT technology to offer increasingly efficient, flexible, inclusive and integrated mobility services.
“We are very proud to cooperate with Blinkee – claimed Matteo Pertosa, founder and CEO of VAIMOO – this agreement gives us the opportunity to collaborate with an important European player in micro-mobility and represents another step in our growth strategy focused on the development of high-value mobility systems, integrated and tailored for smart cities”.
“Introducing a new generation of electric bikes to our offer is a realization of the concept of multimodal transportation for cities” – says Marcin Maliszewski, CEO of Blinkee. “In today’s world the most important values are health and time, and ecological bikes are the easiest and actually the only way to fight smog and traffic jams in metropolises” – he adds.
In this partnership, VAIMOO’s goals perfectly fit Blinkee’s strategy to create alternative transportation services that are safe, full accessible with low emissions and able to provide an innovative mobility experience.

Last month, self-driving technology company TuSimple shipped a truckload of watermelons across the state of Texas ten hours faster than normal. They did this by using their automated driving system for over 900 miles of the journey. The test drive was considered a success, and marked the beginning of a partnership between TuSimple and produce distributor Guimarra. This is one of the first such partnerships announced, but TuSimple may soon have some competition from another big player in the driverless vehicles game: Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Waymo.
Yesterday, Waymo announced a partnership with transportation logistics company JB Hunt to move cargo in automated trucks in Texas. The first route they’ll drive is between Houston and Fort Worth, which Waymo claims is “one of the most highly utilized freight corridors in the country.”
At around 260 miles long, much of the route is a straight shot on Interstate 45. The trucks will have human safety drivers on board who will likely take over some of the city driving portions, but the goal is to use the automated system as much as possible. A software technician will be on board as well, which makes sense given software will be doing the bulk of the driving.
Waymo has been testing driverless trucks in Texas since last August, when it established a hub in Dallas from which to deploy its fleet of 18-wheelers, complete with cameras, lidar, and on-board computers. It’s no coincidence that the Lone Star State is getting so much driverless action; its mild climate and vast highway network make for a lot of space to drive and a lot of time throughout the year to do so—and a 2017 bill allows vehicles to operate without a driver there.
There are five levels of automation in driving, or if you count level 0 (where there’s no automation at all and a human driver is fully in control at all times), six. At Level 5—full autonomy—the vehicle can drive itself anywhere (around cities, on highways, on rural roads, etc.) in any conditions (rain, sun, fog, etc.) without human intervention.
Waymo’s technology, called Waymo Driver (“the world’s most experienced driver,” if the company has its way) is considered Level 4, which means it could operate without a safety driver under certain conditions (namely, good weather). “This will be one of the first opportunities for JB Hunt to receive data and feedback on customer freight moved with a Class 8 tractor operating at this level of autonomy,” said Craig Harper, JB Hunt’s chief sustainability officer and executive vice president.
Despite looming concerns over job losses due to automation in trucking, proponents say that not only will self-driving technology help fill an ongoing shortage of drivers, it will improve safety on roads and decrease food waste, since shipments will arrive to their final destinations faster. JB Hunt, Harper said, believes “there will be a need for highly skilled, professional drivers for many years to come,” but autonomous technologies will improve efficiency and safety.
Whether it’s TuSimple, Waymo, or other players left to enter the field (or in this case, the state of Texas), it seems we’ll soon be finding out if that’s the case.

While the future of the automotive industry is still unwritten, here is what we know: Industry leaders will need to master connectivity to deliver the V2X (vehicle-to-everything) capabilities fully autonomous driving promises.
Autonomous driving is both an audacious visionary goal and a highly achievable feat of technical engineering. The race to launching the industry’s first fully autonomous car is accelerating, as technology companies like Apple and Waymo battle car companies Audi, Ford, Tesla, Renault, Waymo and ride sharing companies Lyft and Uber to overcome technical challenges and enable an entirely new way of driving that will surprise and delight users.
Who will win the race? And how will driverless cars transform society? While the future of the automotive industry is still unwritten, here is what we know: Industry leaders will need to master connectivity to deliver the V2X (vehicle-to-everything) capabilities fully autonomous driving promises. Here’s an overview of six key connectivity requirements to make that happen.
Architectures Must Be Redundant and Real-time
Autonomous driving will increasingly demand more and more reliable network-based structures, requiring redundant, real-time architectures. These architectures will organize high performance clusters in functional domains and be connected via a central gateway in a high-speed data backbone structure. Group sensors and actuators will be organized hierarchically.
Functional domains for connected, autonomous vehicles with high speed in-vehicle networks.
The Demand for High-Speed Data Will Only Increase
Driverless cars will have incredibly sophisticated systems, including high performance computers and an increasing number of advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) sensors, such as high-resolution stereo and/or mono cameras, RADAR, and LIDAR, as well as future human-machine interfaces (HMIs), such as large 4K/8K screens or head-up displays (HUDs).
These systems will generate vast amounts of data, which will require sophisticated electronic support, including high-speed data nodes, links, cables, and assemblies. The inside of the driverless car will literally be an information highway, and data streams will run in parallel or different directions. They’ll be managed in switched networks with sufficient margin to ensure the car’s safe operations.  
Car manufacturers will be required to continuously increase bandwidths for both point-to-point data pipes and distributed network structures to meet new data demands. Level 5 cars will send 25 gigabytes of data to the cloud every hour.
TE Connectivity (TE) has developed gigabit-speed networks that enable global automotive OEMs to meet these connectivity requirements. TE helps automotive leaders achieve their goals, by providing connectivity solutions that overcome myriad mechanical, electrical, and software protocol and interface compatibility challenges.

Safety and Other Applications Require External Connectivity
V2X communications must continuously capture and interpret complete data concerning the surrounding environment. Fully autonomous vehicles require all of this information to correctly execute actions such as braking or accelerating without driver assistance.
V2X communications uses both sensor technology and radio-based communication. Car sensors help vehicle systems interact with their immediate surroundings. Radio systems enable vehicles to exchange information with other vehicles and with traffic infrastructure such as lights, signs and tolls. These surroundings actively communicate their state and changing conditions around them to the vehicle. Thus, a light communicates that it is about to change from red to green, a sign indicates that the next turn-off is five miles ahead, and a vehicle a lane over communicates that it is about to signal and turn right. All of these signals make driving safer. Information on driving conditions, such as icy roads ahead, traffic slowdowns, or tolls, can also enable vehicles to interpret data and make automated decisions, such as choosing another route.
Drivers make decisions in split-seconds, and fully autonomous cars will, too. To be safe, fully autonomous driving requires real-time data transmission.  Current cellular radio standards such as LTE has a latency of 30 to 40 milliseconds, making it unsafe for driverless vehicles. 5G mobile communication, which will be available for deployment in 2019, will provide higher data rates of up to 10 Gbps with considerably lower latency than LTE, making it suitable for real-time safety applications.
Autonomous Driving Quality  and Reliability Are Non-Negotiable
In addition to being real-time, data sensing and transmission must be 100% reliable. What this means is that connectivity can’t fail because of bad road conditions, such as fog, snow, or ice, or extended use, such as thousands and thousands of hours of operation.
Vehicle manufacturers can achieve this goal by using highly robust automotive-grade connectivity systems, provided by competent and experienced suppliers with engineering and materials science expertise.  OEMs’ preferred suppliers must understand contact physics and the best materials for sound electromechanical connections and have built up the exacting manufacturing processes and tools to build them. 
Increasingly Electrified Cars Will Require a New Approach to Safety
Ensuring data integrity within functional safety applications is mandatory for autonomous driving, because human lives will depend on it. As data requirements grow, cars will increasingly electrify. Thus, it is essential to ensure safe data transport on the physical layer level and provide the highest possible physical and data security protections.
Automotive companies are investigating where and when they can use optical-fiber based connectivity to avoid electromagnetic interference.  Fiber optic communications do not experience electro-magnetic emissions, crosstalk, or signal distortion. This means optical communication network channels can be placed near high-power electric cables and devices and provide reliable functioning without safety concerns or interference worries.
Suppliers are also developing in-vehicle networks based on global automotive Ethernet standards which would carry encrypted data, rather than using proprietary and legacy networks where the data is vulnerable and un-encrypted. Adopting these standards would help prevent cars from being hacked and remotely controlled by a malicious actor.
Next-Generation Car Design Will Require Miniaturized Solutions
To fit V2X systems under the hood of a car, manufacturers will need to develop automotive-grade miniaturized and highly integrated connectivity solutions. Sensors and actuators are getting smaller as links increase.  
The Automotive Ethernet enables manufacturers to deliver both power and data over a single pair of wires, either shielded or unshielded.  TE Connectivity has significant experience in confirming the clearance and creepage margins necessary to accomplish this objective.
At the same time, manufacturers will need to determine and meet pollution and moisture tolerances for systems.  In-vehicle networks will need the lightest and leanest cable assemblies and connectors made yet – which will be placed in ever denser configurations.  TE is helping the automotive industry make these trade-offs and optimize their solutions, to make data traverse systems faster and in the most power-efficient way, but with less total material connector and cabling material.
Co-creating the Future of Mobility
Autonomous driving is changing the way we view vehicles and mobility. Next-generation cars will not just enable transportation: They will also enhance passenger safety, comfort, and entertainment. Imagine reclining in your car as you drive, holding videoconference meetings, sending emails, and finishing a project before you ever arrive at work.
Today, transportation is a necessary, but often painful process. With fully autonomous driving, passengers will be freed to accomplish their own goals, turning the dead hours of driving into fruitful hours of learning, working, engaging, and relaxing.
TE is at the forefront of fully autonomous driving innovation. For decades, we have teamed with automotive manufacturers to collaborate on connectivity solutions that set new industry standards. Today, we continue to collaborate with our customers to adopt the new standards and technology innovations and provide the connectivity that will power a new generation of cars.
TE provides a robust, comprehensive automotive data connectivity product portfolio with solutions that meet manufacturers’ requirements for function, safety, link type, chips, and cable type, as well as industry standards and OEM or Tier1 specifications. Plastic fiber optic solutions include MOST Connectors, which carry data at speeds up to 150Mbps, and a next-generation solution, which will enable data rates of 10 to 24 Gbps.

The need for fleet managers to stay connected to their fleet vehicles is an absolute must. Through installed sensors, managers can receive real-time data on GPS location, fuel consumption, telematics, and more. All of which help to improve their dispatch, route planning, and overall business logistics. Let’s take a look at how IoT solutions are transforming the fleet management industry.
How Does IoT Benefit Fleet Management?
IoT fleet management and asset tracking systems offer many benefits, driving increased efficiencies and better outcomes in several areas. Let’s take a closer look at a few. ‍
Safety
While earlier technology only monitored the vehicle’s location along a route, today’s IoT sensors can deliver much more detailed information to fleet operators. For example, they might monitor tire pressure and coolant temperature and be able to trigger an alert if there’s a problem. 
Access to this type of information gives fleet managers a heads up when a safety risk is detected—and if a part is on the verge of failure, they have time to intervene. In-vehicle sensors also deliver constant, valuable information to drivers, helping them make safer decisions.

‍IoT is likely to play an even bigger role in fleet management than it already has. Fleet managers: take advantage of IoT to stay ahead of your competition.Click To Tweet

Vehicle Maintenance
Similarly, IoT sensors can alert drivers and fleet managers to upcoming maintenance needs such as oil changes and tire rotations. Connected sensors can also be installed in the engine to provide insights about the function of essential parts, allowing companies to initiative preventive maintenance—fixing things before they break down completely.‍
Route Optimization
Advanced GPS systems detect traffic and weather conditions along a vehicle’s route and recommend alternate routes as needed. Fleet-wide, this cuts down on fuel consumption and yields other benefits in saved time and increased safety.‍
Cost Savings
‍IoT fleet management solutions provide companies with layers of useful data, which they can use to increase efficiencies around maintenance, routes, driver accountability, and more. All these optimizations ultimately yield cost savings as the company can run its operations in a much leaner, more effective way.‍
Current Challenges for IoT in Fleet Management
While IoT solutions are very successful in fleet management, adopting many sensors and data streams always presents some challenges. That includes data processing and analytics, system integration, and device management. As a solution, some SIM providers include comprehensive device management services to give you real-time visibility into device health, data limits, and usage.‍
Additionally, there are revolutionary applications of IoT in fleet management. Those applications impact fleet management in a variety of ways from monitoring driver behavior to predictive maintenance to big data analytics.  
Fortunately, there are several successful fleet management examples where companies have successfully implemented IoT solutions at scale:For example, Samsara’s fleet management solution includes GPS tracking and real-time compliance and safety information. Their AI dash cams capture incidents and enhances driver safety. 
The Future of IoT in Fleet Management
‍As we can see, there are major benefits to integrating IoT in fleet management, especially in terms of real-time tracking, monitoring driver behavior, and making data-driven decisions. IoT is likely to play an even bigger role in fleet management with time and has become common in large and small fleet deployments. Our advice for fleet managers: take advantage of IoT to stay ahead of your competition.

 Tapping into multiple services, both inside and outside a car, requires a rethinking of everything from architectures to security. 
 BY: ANN STEFFORA MUTSCHLER
Carmakers are reworking their electronic architectures so they can tap into a growing number of external services and internal options, similar to the way a data center taps into various services over its internal network.
In the past, this has been largely confined to internal services such as on-board Internet connectivity, and external traffic routing and music. The current vision is to greatly expand those offerings through faster internal and external communications. But making that all work will require changes on multiple fronts.
The complexity in chips and systems in vehicles is exploding even without considering these new services. Automotive OEMs and their suppliers have been gradually increasing the number of ECUs in vehicles, along with multiple millions of lines of code to enable new features and capabilities. Now, with increasing levels of assisted and autonomous driving being added, that complexity has skyrocketed, rendering the old approach unsustainable.
As competition heats up, the long-established tiered supplier ecosystem is starting to re-orient itself around what consumers want, some of which may be offered by automakers and some of which will become available as infrastructure is built up around vehicles. That includes smart cities, vehicle-to-infrastructure, and localized edge services, and it impacts how communications are structured within a vehicle, how that data traffic is prioritized, and how the compute infrastructure is partitioned. It also determines which ECUs get consolidated, how all of this is tied together within a vehicle, as well as the overall software-driven, service-oriented architectures (SOAs).
SOAs are relatively new in the auto sector because until recently it’s been a one-to-one match between the software and hardware from the Tier 1 or 2 supplier, and they could not be unbundled.
“That’s gone with the changes happening within the automotive ecosystem,” noted David Fritz, senior director for autonomous and ADAS at Siemens Digital Industries Software. “New vehicle architectures are designed to solve very complex problems and get around a lot of the supplier and technology limitations of existing vehicles to ask, ‘How in the world do we architect software to fit that?’ Engineering teams are used to modeling in MATLAB, pushing a button, having the tool generate some C code for their controller, then be done. In a service-oriented architecture (SOA), you don’t even know where that software is going to run. You don’t know if it’s going to run in a hypervisor. You don’t know whether or not you’re going to have full control of that microcontroller, or if something could be downloaded much later that could impact your performance. How in the world do you do that? This points back to digital twins that need to provide simulation results to indicate where the boundaries are. At the same time, the design of the whole system software architecture is dramatically different because it is dynamically allocated, not statically allocated, and meshed one-to-one to the hardware.”
Utilizing service-oriented architecturesAnother way to think about SOAs is in terms of the zonal architecture concepts that have been discussed more broadly in the industry.
For a service-oriented architecture, there are a few different ways to go about it, including a zonal approach. “When you look at the geography of the car, you have to consider how to chop things up,” said Kurt Shuler, vice president of marketing at Arteris IP. “As part of the ECU consolidation discussion, zonal can be one approach such that, for example, ‘the antilock braking system is usually next to this other subsystem, so let’s put those together, and we’ll make that one electronic system that’ll cover all that stuff.’ However, there are still some who say all of this is going to go together, like a centralized architecture where there is a common brain, which makes sense from a functional safety and redundancy standpoint.”
Zonal architectures are a big deal. “The whole automotive industry is moving to that new architecture because it’s required for autonomous driving to have a more centralized computing infrastructure, but also some distributed multi-purpose, zonal controllers that can take care of all the sensors, and so forth,” said Robert Schweiger, director of automotive solutions at Cadence. “In order to have this, you need high-speed in-vehicle communication, so Ethernet will evolve toward 10 gigabit very soon from 1 gigabit, where we are now. Also, the Automotive Service Alliance is putting its own standard in place for this, which is quite interesting because at the same time last year, MIPI released the MIPI A-PHYi, which should exactly address this thing. So now there are two competing standards going forward that will take us to 16 gigabit per second to solve the connectivity from the Ethernet network to the endpoints — the sensors, for instance — using SerDes type of communication. Within the cloud from ECU to ECU, or to the central computing unit, it will be definitely Ethernet. This means more OEMs will be adopting these high-speed communication standards, because it enables so many other things. With that, you need high-integration ECUs. The central compute units are really massive computers with very complex, very powerful SoCs sitting in the middle. Then, the zonal controllers, if they will be multi-purpose, smaller computing units, basically will evolve as an incarnation of the multiple consolidated ECUs that we have nowadays in the car.”
This is the general direction, but tradeoff discussions around how to structure the architecture are still evolving. Set in the context of Automotive Ethernet (AE) and the additional bandwidth that it brings, it is possible to boot up an entire vehicle using an SOA, with each individual components having its own boot flash.
“Here, it can come up and say, ‘I need access to these services, wherever those services are.’ It could be in the same printed circuit board, it could be on the other end of the vehicle, it could be anywhere, and it actually doesn’t matter where it is. Once you register for those services, if it’s monitoring, for example, a dashboard, there would be monitoring data sent to the speedometer and tachometer. The transmission could also send information,” Fritz explained.
From a functional standpoint, this requires a number of considerations. “With an SOA, a lot of functions are being virtualized that may have some interdependency,” Shuler said. “There could be some interdependency, or they could be completely independent of each other, running out of this single architecture. SOA essentially covers those two parts of the spectrum of where the processing is done, and then what is that processing, and what kind of services? What kind of capabilities does it provide to the vehicle and the overall system. This creates a conflict between, on one end, ‘I’m going to have a microprocessor for every function in the car,’ and ‘I’m going to run everything on a centralized mainframe.’”
It also has a ripple effect on other pieces of the system architecture.
“Whenever you’re dealing with software [like AUTOSAR], it’s great when you don’t have huge meta functions, and you’re able to slice these in there,” Shuler said. “But when there are huge functions, like for autonomous driving, this is where things get maybe more zonal/hierarchical. It’s a mother-daughter type system relationship between multiple aspects. And that’s from a hardware standpoint. There’s also a software brain controlling everything. But when you look at the actual hardware, it’s literally in different places. That’s because of modularity in the architecture based on the old subsystem approach. When there are different subsystems, you want to have some flexibility. There are starting to be more standards for data interchange and different types of processing, as well as the ability to do some pre-processing on the data. Then, instead of sending all the bits over, you can say, ‘Here’s this data format that shows what objects are over there, which could be from a lidar, radar, or camera, but the object classifications have to be there.”
There are a few ways automotive ecosystem players can start exploring SOA. The primary approach was borrowed from the robot industry, called ROS, or robot operating system.
“A few years ago, companies started applying the ROS service-oriented concept to prototype cars, and it’s still very new. Most people don’t even know that it’s needed, let alone exists, but it’s in a process of being reworked and revamped, and currently there are SOA architectures based on ROS,” said Siemens’ Fritz. “Early explorations into that highlighted the pros and cons, and we’re taking that now into the OEMs, saying, ‘Until you can sort out what you want, ROS is a really good place to start.’ The only question is, even if you’re using ROS, that’s kind of like the communication layer for an SOA. On top of that, you need semantic information. For instance, how do you find the right balance between what a smart city infrastructure does, and what the vehicle does onboard?”
Security concernsThere are security implications for smart city infrastructures interacting with a vehicle’s architecture, not all of which have been fully addressed.
“In the communication between cars and their surroundings, this brings up fundamental questions about performance and security,” Thierry Kouthon, technical product manager at Rambus Security said. “Here, security is mostly about authentication. You have to make sure that the car that is talking to you is actually a car, and that it is a genuine car from a genuine manufacturer, not some hacker, or some adversarial entity trying to send fake signals or jam your reactions. This requires public key cryptography in order for cars to authenticate each other, so I know that the 100 signals that I’ve received from all those cars that are surrounding me are from actual cars from Volkswagen, Mercedes, General Motors, etc.”
In order to do that, you need two things. First, a root of trust is essential to ensure that nobody can pervasively inspect the cryptographic processing, and the cryptographic operation while being processed.
“You need that on both sides,” Kouthon said. “In addition to the communication in the V2X context, security must be inside the vehicle itself. Modern cars are more like computers on wheels than what they were conceived of 50 years ago, for several reasons. A typical car contains 50 to 100 computers for steering, cruise control, entertainment, instrumentation, brake lights, you name it. It has a lot of components, with each of these components being computerized, and 70% of those components have been provided by suppliers to the OEM, not by the OEM itself. How do you make sure that everybody that is supplying something to you is genuine and that it’s not injecting the car with something malicious?”
Second, all these computers communicate via a network — the CAN bus — which is ubiquitous in cars, and typically is not featured with any security for cost reasons, Kouthon explained. “It’s not because the OEMs and Tier 1s don’t know how to make it secure. It’s because vehicle margins are slim. It’s a big bus. It’s a lot of wiring, and making it very secure will cost money, increase the car’s bill of materials, etc. The approach now is to put the security inside the electronic control units (ECUs), because each one of these ECUs has a computer inside the processor, and since we cannot secure the network between the processors, instead the processors are secured so that when they talk to each other, regardless of the communication medium, they can authenticate each other.”
For security in a smart city, it’s essentially about electronic warfare and countermeasures, and all devices utilized must be suited for those applications, said Willard Tu, director of automotive at Xilinx. “You want to make sure people aren’t spoofing your lidar or radar data, sending you misinformation. And that’s what happens in [a military] battle zone, and none of us want to think about it, but that’s what electronic countermeasures are trying to do — confuse your sensor array and take it over if possible.”
This is familiar ground for security, even though it’s an ongoing challenge. “Fundamentally, within those types of environments security always boils down into having base properties in place,” said Jason Oberg, CTO of Tortuga Logic. “You want to encrypt everything, making sure no one can steal the information. And then you want to make sure that all your information is signed and authentic, meaning that if I send something to another vehicle, or to a building, or to a sign or part of the infrastructure, that it’s authentically coming from me — and not an attacker on the side of the road with their laptop and an antenna, injecting material into the system that causes it to think it’s me, and then my car behaves differently. It sounds simple, but because everything is so distributed, it’s a mess of key management, and how to update who is who. How do I know that the keys that I have to say ‘I’m Jason,’ are the most up to date keys? Who’s the central owner of all that? On the Internet there are certificate authorities that say, ‘This is Google,’ so that when you go to Google, you can trust that it is Google. Everything that’s coming from them is signed. That same kind of infrastructure is needed for automobiles.”
All of this needs to be stored down at the hardware level in a vehicle. “In your laptop, you control it, unless someone steals it, and with infrastructure someone could just climb up a telephone pole and muck with something so it’s a different attack model,” Oberg said. “For this reason, it is really important to have everything routed down into the actual chip, and that’s where the root of trust is really important. Those keys need to be stored securely somewhere.”
Additionally, the level of communication that will be required to make it possible for vehicles to interface with any and all manner of infrastructure will be massive, and 5G is the obvious technology to enable it. That will ratchet up the need for edge computing, AI, and increased verification.
“The complexities involved with making sure these communications happen safely and securely will be astounding,” said Jorg Grosse, product manager for functional safety at OneSpin Solutions. “Formal verification will play a crucial role in the verification of the integrated circuits that will power this intelligent communication. The technology will go beyond simply making sure designs operate as intended. It also must ensure that safety and security vulnerabilities and weaknesses are eliminated.”
As smart cities evolve alongside autonomous developments, 5G is emerging as the common denominator.
“For V2X, they want to use 5G for the communications,” said Ron DiGiuseppe, automotive IP segment manager at Synopsys. “In fact, the 3GPP implemented specific features in 5G that would make it more useful for automotive, one of which is improved reliability, and of course, improved bandwidth. It’s important to make sure that if there’s also policy-based data rates, that they’ve added some prioritization. This means when data gets communicated over that 5G link, if someone in the back seat is streaming a movie for their rear seat entertainment, the last thing you want is that streaming data to interfere with the safety-critical data such as V2X or autonomous driving. 5G has specific features that allow it to prioritize the data. That helps for safety applications. When it comes to V2X and autonomous, the autonomous application uses 5G for that very high resolution mapping for the path planning, and the V2X uses 5G for the V2X communications. Then, the rear seat entertainment would be using 5G to stream the movie smoothly. This means we have to make sure both of those applications, the V2X and the autonomous — since they’ll both be running over 5G and need to share the bandwidth — will run simultaneously.”
Further, Grosse expects continuous product lifecycle verification to be adopted, as well, because there will be a wide range in the age of devices communicating with one another, while keeping up with the constant evolution of security requirements.
ConclusionGiven the complexity, and still-evolving SOA solutions, making the transition to SOA may be a nightmare.
“If you’re a traditional automotive player, you’re not used to dealing with a billion lines of code, or hundreds of millions of lines of code, or tens of millions of lines of code, but now you’re having to deal with that,” said Arteris IP’s Shuler. “If you’re a startup and you’re entering automotive, maybe you came over from some AI point of view. Or maybe you worked at a Qualcomm on digital baseband modems, and then you have all these other requirements, expectations, information sharing and things that you used to have 100% control over. Now you don’t, because of what your customers’ customer is saying is totally different. Everybody in the automotive ecosystem has to change. Traditional car suppliers have to get a little bit more flexible. The car companies have to learn to be more nimble, but that requires more risk. And then the folks who are coming into the industry from industries where risk was acceptable, they have to be more diligent about process and put in more bounding boxes.”
